gandalf Fool of a Took !
gandalf Look at me .
pippin Gandalf , forgive me .
gandalf Look at me .
gandalf What did you see ?
pippin A tree .
pippin A white tree .
pippin In a courtyard of stone .
pippin It was dead !
pippin The city was burning .
gandalf Minas Tirith .
gandalf Is that what you saw ?
pippin I saw ...
pippin I saw him !
pippin I can hear his voice in my head .
gandalf What did you tell him ?
gandalf Speak !
pippin He asked me my name .
pippin I didn't answer .
pippin He hurt me .
gandalf What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring ?
gandalf There was no lie in Pippin's eyes .
gandalf A fool , but an honest fool he remains .
gandalf He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring .
gandalf We've been strangely fortunate .
gandalf Pippin saw in the palantÃ­r a glimpse of the Enemy's plan .
gandalf Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith .
gandalf His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing .
gandalf He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth .
gandalf Men are not as weak as he supposed .
gandalf There is courage still ...strength perhaps to challenge him .
gandalf Sauron fears this .
gandalf He will not risk the peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one banner .
gandalf He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground before he sees a king return to the throne of Men .
gandalf If the beacons of Gondor are lit , Rohan must be ready for war .
theodien Tell me ; why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours ?
theodien What do we owe Gondor ?
aragorn I will go .
gandalf No .
aragorn They must be warned !
gandalf They will be !
gandalf You must come to Minas Tirith by another road .
gandalf Follow the river , look to the black ships .
gandalf Understand this , things are now in motion that cannot be undone .
gandalf I ride for Minas Tirith .
gandalf And I won't be going alone .
gandalf Of all the inquisitive Hobbits , Peregrin Took , you are the worst !
gandalf Hurry , hurry !
pippin Where are we going ?
merry Why did you look ?
merry Why do you always have to look ?
pippin I don't know .
pippin I can't help it .
merry You never can .
pippin I'm sorry , all right ?
pippin I won't do it again .
merry Don't you understand ?
merry The Enemy thinks you have the Ring .
merry He's going to be looking for you , Pip .
merry They have to get you out of here .
pippin And you-you're coming with me ?
pippin Merry ?
merry Come on .
pippin How far is Minas Tirith ?
gandalf Three days' ride , as the Nazgul flies , and you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail .
merry Here , something for the road .
pippin The last of the Longbottom Leaf ?
merry I know you've run out .
merry You smoke too much , Pip .
pippin But we'll see each other soon ...won't we ?
merry I don't know ...
merry I don't know what's going to happen .
pippin Merry ... ?
gandalf Run Shadowfax .
gandalf Show us the meaning of haste !
pippin Merry !
aragorn Merry !
elrond Take her by the safest road .
elrond A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens .
elrond It waits to carry her across the sea ...
elrond the last journey of Arwen UndÃ³miel .
elrond There is nothing for you here .
elrond Only death .
figwit Lady Arwen , we cannot delay .
figwit My Lady !
arwen Tell me what you have seen .
elrond Arwen .
arwen You have the gift of foresight .
arwen What did you see ?
elrond I looked into your future and I saw death .
arwen But there is also life .
arwen You saw there was a child !
arwen You saw my son !
elrond That future is almost gone .
arwen But it is not lost .
elrond Nothing is certain .
arwen Some things are certain .
arwen If I leave him now , I will regret it forever .
arwen It is time .
arwen From the ashes a fire shall be woken .
arwen A light from the shadows shall spring .
arwen Renewed shall be blade that was broken .
arwen The crownless again shall be king .
arwen Reforge the sword .
arwen Ada .
elrond Your hands are cold .
elrond The life of the Eldar is leaving you .
arwen This was my choice .
arwen Ada , whether by your will or not , there is no ship now that can bear me hence .
gandalf We've just passed into the realm of Gondor .
gandalf Minas Tirith .
gandalf City of Kings .
gandalf Make way !
pippin It's the tree .
pippin Gandalf , Gandalf !
gandalf Yes , the White Tree of Gondor .
gandalf The Tree of the King .
gandalf Lord Denethor is not the king .
gandalf He is a steward , only .
gandalf A caretaker of the throne .
gandalf Now , listen carefully .
gandalf Lord Denethor is Boromir's father .
gandalf To give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise .
gandalf And do not mention Frodo , or the Ring .
gandalf And say nothing of Aragorn , either .
gandalf In fact , it's better if you don't speak at all , Peregrin Took .
gandalf Hail Denethor , son of Ecthelion , Lord and Steward of Gondor .
gandalf I come with tidings in this dark hour , and with counsel .
denethor Perhaps you come to explain this .
denethor Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead .
pippin Boromir died to save us , my kinsman and me .
pippin He fell defending us from many foes .
gandalf Pippin !
pippin I offer you my service , such as it is , in payment of this debt .
gandalf Get up !
gandalf My Lord , there will be a time to grieve for Boromir .
gandalf But it is not now .
gandalf War is coming .
gandalf The enemy is on your doorstep !
gandalf As steward , you are charged with the defense of this city !
gandalf Where are Gondor's armies ?
gandalf You still have friends .
gandalf You are not alone in this fight .
gandalf Send word to Theoden of Rohan .
gandalf Light the beacons .
denethor You think you are wise , Mithrandir , yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom .
denethor Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind ?
denethor I have seen more than you know .
denethor With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor , and with your right you would seek to supplant me !
denethor I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan .
denethor Oh yes !
denethor Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn , son of Arathorn , and I tell you now I will not bow to this Ranger from the North , last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship .
gandalf Authority is not given you to deny the return of the king , Steward .
denethor The rule of Gondor is mine , and no other's !
gandalf Come .
pippin So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position .
pippin I mean , they don't actually expect me to do any fighting , do they ?
gandalf You're in the service of the steward now .
gandalf You're going to have to do as you're told
gandalf , Peregrin Took , Guard of the Citadel .
pippin It's so quiet .
gandalf It's the deep breath before the plunge .
pippin I don't want to be in a battle , but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse .
pippin Is there any hope , Gandalf , for Frodo and Sam ?
gandalf There never was much hope ...
gandalf just a fool's hope .
gandalf Our Enemy is ready , his full strength gathered .
gandalf Not only Orcs , but Men as well .
gandalf Legions of Haradrim from the south .
gandalf Mercenaries from the coast .
gandalf All will answer Mordor's call .
gandalf This will be the end of Gondor as we know it .
gandalf Here the hammer-stroke will fall the hardest .
gandalf If the river is taken , if the garrison at Osgiliath falls , the last defense of this city will be gone .
pippin But we have the White Wizard , that's got to count for something .
pippin Gandalf ?
gandalf Sauron has yet to release his deadliest servant .
gandalf The one who will lead Mordor's armies in war .
gandalf The one they say no living Man can kill .
gandalf The king of Angmar .
gandalf You've met him before .
gandalf He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop .
gandalf He is the lord of the Nazgul , the greatest of the Nine .
gandalf Minas Morgul is his lair .
gollum The dead city .
gollum Very nasty place .
gollum Full of enemies .
gollum Quick , quick !
gollum They will see , they will see .

gollum Come away , Hobbits .
gollum We climb , we must climb .
gandalf The board is set .
gandalf The pieces are moving .
gandalf Peregrin Took , my lad , there is a task now to be done .
gandalf Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth .
gandalf You must not fail me .
gothmog Quiet !

faramir Quick ...

eowyn It's tradition for the Women of the Court to farewell the Men .
eowyn The Men have found their captain .
eowyn They will follow you into battle , even to death .
eowyn You have given us hope .
theodien So , it is before the walls of Minas Tirith , the doom of our time will be decided .

gandalf Foreseen and done nothing !
gandalf Faramir ?
gandalf This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path ?
faramir No ...
pippin You've seen Frodo and Sam ?
gandalf Where ?
gandalf When ?
faramir In Ithilien , not two days ago .
faramir Gandalf , they've taken the road to the Morgul Vale .
gandalf And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol ?
pippin What does that mean ?
pippin What's wrong ?
gandalf Faramir , tell me everything .

gothmog What of the Wizard ?
king I will break him .
soldier What of Theoden's Riders ?
soldier Will Rohan come ?
soldier Mithrandir ?
gandalf Courage is the best defense you have now .
pippin Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor , in peace or war , in living or dying , from ...from this hour henceforth , until my lord release me , or death take me .
denethor And I shall not forget it , nor fail to reward that which is given .
denethor Fealty with love , valor with honor , disloyalty with vengeance .
denethor I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses .
denethor Defenses that your brother long held intact .
faramir What would you have me do ?
denethor I will not yield the river and Pelennor unfought .
denethor Osgiliath must be retaken .
faramir My Lord , Osgiliath is overrun .
denethor Much must be risked in war .
denethor Is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord's will ?
faramir You wish now that our places had been exchanged .
faramir That I had died and Boromir had lived .
denethor Yes , I wish that .
faramir Since you are robbed of Boromir , I will do what I can in his stead .
faramir If I should return , think better of me , father .
denethor That will depend on the manner of your return .

aragorn We have till dawn , then we must ride .
legolas The horses are restless and the Men are quiet .

elrond A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south .
elrond They'll be in the city in two days .
elrond You're outnumbered .
elrond You need more Men .
aragorn There are none .
elrond There are those who dwell in the mountain .
aragorn Murderers ... traitors !
aragorn You would call upon them to fight ?
aragorn They believe in nothing !
aragorn They answer to no one !
elrond They will answer to the King of Gondor !
elrond Anduril , Flame of the West , forged from the Shards of Narsil .
aragorn Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil .
aragorn The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith .
elrond The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth .
elrond Put aside the Ranger .
elrond Become who you were born to be .
elrond Take the Dimholt road .
eowyn Why are you doing this ?

gandalf He has suffered a defeat , yes , but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping .
gimli Let him stay there .
gimli Let him rot !
gimli Why should we care ?
gandalf Because ten thousand Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom .
gandalf I've sent him to his death .
aragorn No .
aragorn There's still hope for Frodo .
aragorn He needs time , and safe passage across the Plains of Gorgoroth .
aragorn We can give him that .
gimli How ?
aragorn Draw out Sauron's armies .
aragorn Empty his lands .
aragorn Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate .
eomer We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms .
aragorn Not for ourselves , but we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us .
aragorn Keep him blind to all else that moves .
legolas A diversion .
gandalf Sauron will suspect a trap .
gandalf He will not take the bait .
gimli Certainty of death .
gimli Small chance of success .
gimli What are we waiting for ?
orc To the gate , you slugs !

aragorn My brothers .
aragorn I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me .
aragorn A day may come when the courage of Men fails , when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship , but it is not this day .
aragorn An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down , but it is not this day !
aragorn This day we fight !
aragorn By all that you hold dear on this good earth , I bid you stand , Men of the West !
gimli Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf .
legolas What about side by side with a friend ?
gimli Aye , I could do that .
sam Do you remember the Shire , Mister Frodo ?
sam It'll be spring soon , and the Orchards will be in blossom .
sam And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket
sam and they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields .
sam And eating the first of the strawberries with cream .
sam Do you remember the taste of strawberries ?
frodo No , Sam , I can't recall the taste of food .
frodo Nor the sound of water .
frodo Or the touch of grass .
frodo I'm naked in the dark .
frodo There's nothing ...
frodo no veil between me and the wheel of fire .

frodo And thus it was , the Fourth Age of Middle-earth began , and the Fellowship of the Ring , though eternally bound by friendship and love , was ended .
frodo Thirteen months to the day , since Gandalf sent us on our long journey , we found ourselves looking upon a familiar site .
frodo We were home .
frodo How do you pick up the threads of an old life ?
frodo How do you go on ,
frodo when in your heart , you begin to understand , there is no going back ?
frodo There are some things that time cannot mend .
frodo Some hurts that go too deep ...that have taken hold .
sam Mr .

eowyn Will you do nothing ?
gandalf Be careful what you say .
gandalf Do not look for welcome here .
wormtongue_ Oh , he ... he must have died sometime in the night .
wormtongue_ What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir .
wormtongue_ I understand his passing is hard to accept , especially now that your brother has deserted you .
eowyn Leave me alone you snake !
wormtongue_ Oh , but you are alone !
wormtongue_ Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness .
wormtongue_ In bitter watches of the night , when all your life seems to shrink , the walls of your bower closing in about you , like a hutch to trammel some wild thing in .
wormtongue_ So fair , so cold , like a morning pale spring still clinging to winter's chill .
eowyn Your words are poison !
gimli You'd find more cheer in a graveyard .
gandalf Ah .
hama I cannot allow you before Theoden-King so armed , Gandalf Grayhame .
hama By order of Grima Wormtongue .

gandalf No , you would not part an old man from his walking stick ?
wormtongue_ My lord , Gandalf the Grey is coming .
wormtongue_ He's a herald of woe .
gandalf The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late , Theoden King .
wormtongue_ He's not welcome .
theoden Why should I ... welcome you , Gandalf ... Stormcrow ?
wormtongue_ A just question , my liege .
wormtongue_ Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear .
wormtongue_ Lathspell spell
wormtongue_ I name him .
wormtongue_ Ill news is an ill guest .
gandalf Be silent !
gandalf Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth .
gandalf I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm !
wormtongue_ His staff !
wormtongue_ I told you to take the wizard's staff !
gandalf Theoden , son of Thengel , too long have you sat in the shadows .
gimli I would stay still , if I were you .
gandalf Harken to me !
gandalf I release you from the spell .
theoden Hahahhhahahahah !
theoden You have no power here , Gandalf the Grey !
theoden Argh !
gandalf I shall draw you , Saruman , as poison is drawn from a wound .
aragorn Wait .
theoden If I go . . .

gandalf Be gone! !
theoden I know your face .
theoden Eowyn ...
theoden Eowyn .
gandalf Breathe the free air again , my friend .
theoden Dark have been my dreams of late .
gandalf Your fingers would remember their old strenth better ... if they grasped your sword .
wormtongue_ Argh !
wormtongue_ I've only ever served you , my lord !
theoden Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast !
wormtongue_ Send me not from your side .
aragorn No , my lord !
aragorn No , my lord .
aragorn Let him go .
aragorn Enough blood has been spilled on his account .
wormtongue_ Get out of my way !
hama Hail , Theoden king !
theoden Where is Theodred ?
theoden Where is my son ?
theoden Simbelmyne .
theoden Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears .
theoden Now it shall cover the grave of my son .
theoden Alas , that these evil days should be mine .
theoden The young perish and the old linger .
theoden That I should live to see the last days of my house .
gandalf Theodred's death was not of your making .
theoden No parent should have to bury their child .
gandalf His was strong in life .
gandalf His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers .
eowyn The had no warning .
eowyn They were unarmed .
eowyn Now the wildmen are moving through the Westfold , burning as they go .
eowyn Rick , cot and tree .
freda Where's mama ?
eowyn Shh ...
gandalf This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash .
gandalf All the more potent for he is driven mad by fear of Sauron .
gandalf Ride out and meet him head on .
gandalf Draw him away from your women and children .
gandalf You must fight .
aragorn You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak .
theoden They will be three hundred leagues from here by now .
theoden Eomer cannot help us .
theoden I know what it is that you want of me .
theoden But I will not bring further death to my people .
theoden I will not risk open war .
aragorn Open war is upon you .
aragorn Whether you would risk it or not .
theoden When last I looked , Theoden , not Aragorn , was king of Rohan .
gandalf Then what is the king's decision ?
hama By order of the king , the city must empty .
hama We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep .
hama Do not burden yourselves with treasures .
hama Take only what provisions you need .
gimli Helm's Deep !
gimli They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight .
gimli Who will defend them if not their king .
aragorn He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people .
aragorn Helm's Deep has saved them in the past .
gandalf There is no way out of that ravine .
gandalf Theoden is walking into a trap .
gandalf He thinks he's leading them to safety .
gandalf What they will get is a massacre .
gandalf Theoden has a strong will but I fear for him .
gandalf I fear for the survival of Rohan .
gandalf He will need you before the end , Aragorn .
gandalf The people of Rohan will need you .
gandalf The defences HAVE to hold .
aragorn They will hold .
gandalf The Grey Pilgrim ...
gandalf that's what they used to call me .
gandalf Three hundred lives of men I've walked this earth
gandalf and now I have no time .
gandalf Good luck .
gandalf My search will not be in vain .
gandalf Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day .
gandalf At dawn , look to the East .
aragorn Go .
aragorn You have some skill with a blade .
eowyn Women of this country learned long ago that those without swords may still die upon them .
eowyn I fear neither death nor pain .
aragorn What do you fear , my lady ?
eowyn A cage .
eowyn To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire .
aragorn You are a daughter of kings , a shieldmaiden of Rohan .
aragorn I do not think that will be your fate .
wormtongue_ Theoden will not stay at Edoras .
wormtongue_ It's vulnerable , he knows this .
wormtongue_ He will expect an attack on the city .
wormtongue_ They will flee to Helm's Deep , the great fortress of Rohan .
wormtongue_ It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains .
wormtongue_ They will be slow .
wormtongue_ They will have women and children with them .
saruman_ Send out your warg riders .

gimli And in fact , they are so alike in voice and appearence , haha that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men .
aragorn It's the beards ... .
gimli And this , in turn , has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women .

theoden Get them into the cave .
theoden Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here .
wormtongue_ Helm's Deep has one weakness .
wormtongue_ It's outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain .
wormtongue_ How ?
wormtongue_ How can fire undo stone ?
wormtongue_ What kind of device could bring down the wall ?
saruman_ If the wall is breached , Helm's Deep will fall .
wormtongue_ Even if it is breached , it would take a number beyond reckoning , thousands to storm the keep .
saruman_ Tens of thousands .
wormtongue_ But , my lord , there is no such force .
saruman_ A new power is rising .
saruman_ Its victory is at hand !
saruman_ This night , the land would be stained with the blood of Rohan !
saruman_ March to Helms Deep !
saruman_ Leave none alive !
saruman_ To war! !
saruman_ There will be no dawn for Men .

treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 But now he has a mind of metal and wheels .
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode02 He no longer cares for growing things .
pippin What is it ?
merry It's Saruman's army !
merry The war has started .
arwen May the grace of the Valar protect you .
arwen I have made my choice .
elrond He is not coming back .
elrond Why do you linger here when there is no hope ?
arwen There is still hope .
elrond If Aragorn survives this war , you will still be parted .
elrond If Sauron is defeated , and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true , you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality .
elrond Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time , Aragorn will die .
elrond And there will be no comfort for you .
elrond No comfort to ease the pain of his passing .
elrond He will come to death , an image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world .
elrond But you , my daughter , you will linger on in darkness and in doubt .
elrond As nightfall in winter that comes without a star .
elrond Here you will dwell , bound to your grief , under the fading trees , until all the world has changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent .

galadriel Men , who are so easily seduced by its power .
galadriel The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hands , take the Ring for his own and the world will fall .
galadriel It is close now , so close to achieving its goal .
galadriel For Sauron will have dominion of all life on this Earth , even until the ending of the world .
galadriel The time of the Elves is over .

deagol Sméagol! I've got one; I've got a fish, Sme-Sméagol! 
smeagol Go on, go on, go on, pull it in! 
smeagol Give us that Déagol, my love. 
deagol Why? 
smeagol Because...it's my birthday and I wants it. 
ring  ...batul. Ash nazg gimbatul... 
smeagol My Precious. 
smeagol  They cursed us. "Murderer" they called us. They cursed us and drove us away. 
gollum Gollum, Gollum, Gollum. 
smeagol  And we wept, precious. We wept, to be so alone. 
smeagol And we forgot the taste of bread, the sound of trees, the softness of the wind. We even forgot our own name. My Precious. 
gollum Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies, we must go, yes, we must go at once. 
sam Haven't you had any sleep, Mister Frodo? 
sam I've gone and had too much. It must be getting late. 
frodo No. It isn't. It isn't midday yet. The days are growing darker. 
gollum Come on! Must go, no time! 
sam Not before Mister Frodo's had somethin' to eat. 
gollum No time to lose, silly! 
sam Here. 
frodo What about you? 
sam Ahhh no, I'm not hungry. Least ways not for lembas bread. 
frodo Sam… 
sam All right. We don't have that much left. We have to be careful or we're going to run out. You go ahead and eat that, Mister Frodo. I've rationed it. There should be enough. 
frodo For what? 
sam The journey home. 
gollum Come, Hobbitses. Very close now, very close, to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry! 
pippin I feel like I'm back at the Green Dragon after a hard day's work. 
merry Only, you've never done a hard day's work. 
merry Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard! 
gimli You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on, and now we find you, feasting and… smoking! 
pippin We are sitting on a field of victory, enjoying a few well-earned comforts. The salted pork is particularly good. 
gimli Salted pork? 
gandalf  Hobbits. 
merry We're under orders, from Treebeard, who's taken over management of Isengard. 
treebeard Young master Gandalf. I'm glad you've come. Wood and water, stock and stone, I can master. But there is a Wizard to manage here. Look to his tower. 
gandalf And there Saruman must remain. Under your guard, Treebeard. 
gimli Well, let's just have his head and be done with it. 
gandalf No. He has no power anymore. 
treebeard The filth of Saruman is washing away. Trees will come back to live here. Young trees, wild trees. 
aragorn Pippin! 
treebeard Bless my bark! 
gandalf Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad. Quickly now. Th
éoden Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. Hail the victorious dead! 
crowd Hail! 
éowyn Westu Aragorn hál. Th
éoden I am happy for you. He is an honorable Man. 
éowyn You are both honorable Men. Th
éoden It was not Théoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.  Ah, don't listen to me. You are young, and tonight is for you. Merry and 
pippin Oh you can search far and wide, You can drink the whole town dry, But you'll never find a beer so brown, As the one we drink in our hometown. You can keep your fancy ales, You can drink them by the flagon, But the only brew for the brave and true, Comes from the Green Dragon! 
aragorn No news of Frodo? 
gandalf No word. Nothing. 
aragorn We have time. Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor. 
gandalf Do we know that? 
aragorn What does your heart tell you? 
gandalf That Frodo is alive. Yes. Yes, he's alive. 
smeagol Too risky. Too risky. Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both! 
gollum Shh! Quiet. Mustn't wake them. Mustn't ruin it now. 
smeagol But they knows. They knows. They suspects us! 
gollum What's it saying, my precious, my love? Sméagol losing his nerve? 
smeagol No. Not. Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Sméagol wants to see them...dead. 
gollum And we will. Sméagol did it once, he can do it again.  It's ours. Ours! 
smeagol We must get the precious. We must get it back. 
gollum Patience. Patience, my love. First we must lead them to her. 
smeagol We lead them to the winding stairs. 
gollum Yes. The stairs. And then? 
smeagol Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go, until we come to...the tunnel. 
gollum And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry. She always needs…to feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses. 
smeagol And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious? 
gollum No. Not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats, Hobbit-meat.  And when she throws away the bones, and empty clothes, then we will find it. 
smeagol And take it for me! 
gollum For us. 
smeagol Y-yes, we meant for us. *gollum, gollum* 
gollum The precious will be ours, once the Hobbitses are dead. 
sam You miserable little toad! 
smeagol Master! 
frodo No, Sam! Leave him alone! 
sam I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us! 
smeagol Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly!  Argh! He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Sméagol and makes up nasty lies! 
sam You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in! 
frodo Sam! 
sam Don't call me a liar! You're a liar! 
smeagol Argh! 
frodo You'll scare him off! We're lost! 
sam I don't care! I can't do it, Mister Frodo; I won't wait around for him to kill us. 
frodo I'm not sending him away! 
sam You don't see it, do you? He's a villain! 
frodo We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side. 
sam I'm on your side, Mister Frodo. 
frodo I know, Sam. I know. Trust me. Come, Sméagol. 
legolas The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East…a sleepless malice. 
legolas The Eye of the Enemy is moving. 
merry What you doing? 
merry Pippin? 
merry Pippin, are you mad? 
pippin I just want to look at it. Just one more time. 
merry Put it back! 
merry Pippin! No! Pippin... 
legolas He is here! 
sauron I see you... 
merry Pippin! Help! Gandalf! Someone help him! 
merry Pippin! 
gandalf Fool of a Took! 
gandalf Look at me. 
pippin  Gandalf, forgive me. 
gandalf Look at me. What did you see?  
pippin A tree. A white tree. In a courtyard of stone. It was dead! 
pippin The city was burning. 
gandalf Minas Tirith. Is that what you saw? 
pippin I saw...I saw him! I can hear his voice in my head. 
gandalf What did you tell him? Speak! 
pippin He asked me my name. I didn't answer. He hurt me. 
gandalf What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring? 
gandalf There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the palantír a glimpse of the Enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing. He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still…strength perhaps to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground before he sees a king return to the throne of Men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war. Th
éoden Tell me; why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? What do we owe Gondor? 
aragorn I will go. 
gandalf No. 
aragorn They must be warned! 
gandalf They will be!  You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river, look to the black ships.  Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for Minas Tirith. And I won't be going alone.  
gandalf Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry, hurry! 
pippin Where are we going? 
merry  Why did you look? Why do you always have to look? 
pippin I don't know. I can't help it. 
merry You never can. 
pippin I'm sorry, all right? I won't do it again. 
merry Don't you understand? The Enemy thinks you have the Ring. He's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here. 
pippin And you-you're coming with me?  Merry? 
merry Come on. 
pippin How far is Minas Tirith? 
gandalf Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies, and you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail. 
merry Here, something for the road. 
pippin The last of the Longbottom Leaf? 
merry I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pip. 
pippin But we'll see each other soon...won't we? 
merry I don't know... I don't know what's going to happen. 
pippin Merry...? 
gandalf Run Shadowfax. Show us the meaning of haste! 
pippin Merry! 
aragorn Merry! 
elrond  Take her by the safest road. A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to carry her across the sea...the last journey of Arwen Undómiel. 
elrond  There is nothing for you here. Only death. 
figwit Lady Arwen, we cannot delay.  My Lady! 
arwen Tell me what you have seen. 
elrond  Arwen. 
arwen You have the gift of foresight. What did you see? 
elrond I looked into your future and I saw death. 
arwen But there is also life. You saw there was a child! You saw my son! 
elrond  That future is almost gone. 
arwen But it is not lost. 
elrond Nothing is certain. 
arwen  Some things are certain. If I leave him now, I will regret it forever. It is time. 
arwen From the ashes a fire shall be woken. A light from the shadows shall spring. Renewed shall be blade that was broken. The crownless again shall be king. 
arwen Reforge the sword. Ada. 
elrond  Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you. 
arwen This was my choice. Ada, whether by your will or not, there is no ship now that can bear me hence. 
gandalf We've just passed into the realm of Gondor. 
gandalf Minas Tirith. City of Kings. 
gandalf Make way! 
pippin It's the tree. Gandalf, Gandalf! 
gandalf Yes, the White Tree of Gondor. The Tree of the King. Lord Denethor is not the king. He is a steward, only. A caretaker of the throne. 
gandalf Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father. To give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise. And do not mention Frodo, or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn, either. In fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Peregrin Took. 
gandalf Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor. I come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel. 
denethor Perhaps you come to explain this.  Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead. 
pippin Boromir died to save us, my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from many foes. 
gandalf Pippin! 
pippin I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt. 
gandalf Get up!  My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir. But it is not now. War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep! As steward, you are charged with the defense of this city! Where are Gondor's armies? You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Théoden of Rohan. Light the beacons. 
denethor  You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor, and with your right you would seek to supplant me! I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan. Oh yes! Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you now I will not bow to this Ranger from the North, last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship. 
gandalf Authority is not given you to deny the return of the king, Steward. 
denethor  The rule of Gondor is mine, and no other's! 
gandalf  Come. 
pippin  So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position. I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting, do they? 
gandalf You're in the service of the steward now. You're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took, Guard of the Citadel. 
pippin It's so quiet. 
gandalf It's the deep breath before the plunge. 
pippin I don't want to be in a battle, but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse.  Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam? 
gandalf There never was much hope...just a fool's hope. Our Enemy is ready, his full strength gathered. Not only Orcs, but Men as well. Legions of Haradrim from the south. Mercenaries from the coast. All will answer Mordor's call. This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammer-stroke will fall the hardest. If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defense of this city will be gone. 
pippin But we have the White Wizard, that's got to count for something. Gandalf? 
gandalf Sauron has yet to release his deadliest servant.  The one who will lead Mordor's armies in war. The one they say no living Man can kill. The Witch-king of Angmar. You've met him before. He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.  He is the lord of the Nazgul, the greatest of the Nine. Minas Morgul is his lair. 
gollum The dead city. Very nasty place. Full of enemies. 
gollum Quick, quick! They will see, they will see. 
gollum Come away, come away. Look! We have found it…the way into Mordor! The secret stair. 
gollum Climb! 
sam No! Mister Frodo! 
gollum Not that way! 
gollum What's it doing? 
sam No! 
frodo They're calling me… 
smeagol Hide, hide!  
frodo  I can feel his blade! 
gandalf We come to it at last. The great battle of our time. 
gollum Come away, Hobbits. We climb, we must climb. 
gandalf The board is set. The pieces are moving. 
gandalf Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth. You must not fail me. 
gothmog Quiet! 
faramir To the river. Quick… 
gothmog  Faster. 
gothmog Draw swords! 
gandalf  Amon Dîn... 
guard The beacon! The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit! 
gandalf Hope is kindled. 
aragorn The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit! Gondor calls for aid! Th
éoden  And Rohan will answer! Th
éoden Muster the Rohirrim!  Assemble the Men at Dunharrow, as many Men as can be found. You have two days. On the third, we ride for Gondor…and war. Gamling! 
gamling Sir. Th
éoden Make haste across the Riddermark. Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow. 
gamling I will. 
aragorn You ride with us? 
éowyn Just to the encampment. It's tradition for the Women of the Court to farewell the Men. 
éowyn The Men have found their captain. They will follow you into battle, even to death. You have given us hope. Th
éoden  So, it is before the walls of Minas Tirith, the doom of our time will be decided. 
éomer Now is the hour! Riders of Rohan! Oaths you have taken, now fulfill them all! For lord and land!  
madril Faramir! 
madril We cannot hold them! The city is lost! 
faramir Tell the Men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith. 
soldier Nazgul! 
soldier Take cover! 
faramir Fall back! Fall back to Minas Tirith! 
faramir Retreat! Retreat! 
gothmog The age of Men is over! The time of the Orc has come! 
soldier It's the White Rider! 
faramir Mithrandir! They broke through our defenses. They've taken the bridge and the west bank. Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river. Gondorian 
soldier It is as the Lord Denethor predicted! Long has he foreseen this doom! 
gandalf Foreseen and done nothing! 
gandalf Faramir? This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path? 
faramir No... 
pippin You've seen Frodo and Sam? 
gandalf Where? When? 
faramir In Ithilien, not two days ago. 
faramir Gandalf, they've taken the road to the Morgul Vale. 
gandalf And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol? 
pippin What does that mean? What's wrong? 
gandalf Faramir, tell me everything. 
gollum Careful, master! Careful! Very far to fall. Very dangerous on the stairs. Come master! 
gollum Come to Sméagol... 
sam Mr. Frodo!  Get back you! Don't touch him! 
gollum Why does he hates poor Sméagol? What has Sméagol ever done to him? 
gollum Master? Master carries heavy burden, Sméagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden. The fat one cannot know. Sméagol will look after master. He wants it. He needs it! Sméagol sees it in his eyes. Very soon, he will ask you for it. You will see. The fat one will take it from you. Witch-
king Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. Slay them all. 
gothmog What of the Wizard? Witch-
king I will break him. Gondorian 
soldier What of Théoden's Riders? Will Rohan come? Mithrandir? 
gandalf Courage is the best defense you have now. 
pippin Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, in peace or war, in living or dying, from...from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me. 
denethor  And I shall not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given.  Fealty with love, valor with honor,  disloyalty with vengeance. 
denethor  I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses. Defenses that your brother long held intact. 
faramir What would you have me do? 
denethor I will not yield the river and Pelennor unfought. Osgiliath must be retaken. 
faramir My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun. 
denethor Much must be risked in war. Is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord's will? 
faramir  You wish now that our places had been exchanged. That I had died and Boromir had lived. 
denethor  Yes, I wish that. 
faramir Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead. 
faramir If I should return, think better of me, father. 
denethor  That will depend on the manner of your return. 
sam What are you up to? Sneaking off are we? 
gollum S-sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Sméagol shows them secret ways that nobody else can find, and they say sneak! Sneak! Very nice friend, oh yes, my precious, very nice, very... 
sam Alright, alright! You just startled me is all. What were you doing? 
gollum  Sneaking. 
sam Fine, have it your own way.  I'm sorry to wake you, Mister Frodo. We have to be moving on. 
frodo It's dark still. 
sam It's always dark here. 
sam It's gone! The Elven-bread! 
frodo What? That's all we have left! 
sam  He took it! He must have! 
gollum Sméagol? No, no, not poor Sméagol. Sméagol hates nasty Elf-bread! 
sam You're a lying wretch! What did you do with it? 
frodo  He doesn't eat it. He can't have taken it. 
gollum Look! What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!  He took it! He took it! I've seen him, he's always stuffing his face when master's not looking! 
sam That's a filthy LIE! 
sam You stinking two-faced sneak! 
frodo Sam! Stop it! Sam!  
sam I'll kill him! 
frodo Sam, no! 
sam Oh no, I'm sorry! I didn't mean it to go so far. I was just so...just so angry. Here ... just…let's just rest a bit. 
frodo I'm alright. 
sam No, no, you're not alright. You're exhausted. It's that Gollum! It's this place. It's that thing around your neck!  I could help a bit. I could carry it for a while. Share the load. 
frodo Get away!  
sam I don't want to keep it! I just want to 'elp. 
gollum See? See? He wants it for himself. 
sam  Shut up, you! Go away, get out of here! 
frodo No, Sam. It's you. I'm sorry, Sam. 
sam But he's a liar. He's poisoned you against me. 
frodo You can't help me anymore. 
sam  You don't mean that. 
frodo  Go home. 
gandalf Faramir! Faramir!  
gandalf Your father's will has turned to madness! Do not throw away your life so rashly! 
faramir Where does my allegiance lie, if not here? 
gandalf Your father loves you, Faramir! He will remember it before the end. 
denethor Can you sing, Master Hobbit? 
pippin Well, yes. At least, well enough for my own people. But we have no songs for great halls and evil times. 
denethor  And why should your songs be unfit for my halls? Come, sing me a song. Home is behind, the world ahead, And there are many paths to tread. Through shadow, to the edge of night, Until the stars are all alight. Mist and shadow, cloud and shade, All shall fade! All shall fade ... Th
éoden Grimbold, how many? 
grimbold I bring five hundred Men from the Westfold, My Lord. 
soldier We have three hundred more from , Théoden King. Th
éoden Where are the riders from Snowbourn? 
soldier None have come, My Lord. Th
éoden Six thousand spears, less than half of what I'd hoped for. 
aragorn Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor. Th
éoden More will come. 
aragorn Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat. We have till dawn, then we must ride. 
legolas The horses are restless and the Men are quiet. 
éomer They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain. 
gimli That road there, where does that lead? 
legolas It is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain. 
éomer None who venture there ever return. 
gimli Aragorn! 
gimli Let's find some food. 
éowyn There, a true Esquire of Rohan. 
merry I'm ready! 
merry Sorry, it isn't all that dangerous. It's not even sharp. 
éowyn  Well, that's no good, you won't kill many Orcs with a blunt blade. Come on. 
éowyn  To the smithy. Go! 
éomer You should not encourage him. 
éowyn You should not doubt him. 
éomer I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm. 
éowyn  Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause to go to war as you. Why can he not fight for those he loves? 
arwen I choose a mortal life. 
arwen I wish I could've seen him...one last time. 
guard Sir? King Théoden awaits you, My Lord. Th
éoden I take my leave.  
aragorn  My Lord Elrond. 
elrond I come on behalf of one whom I love. Arwen is dying. She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor. The light of the Evenstar is failing. As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes. Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn. The end has come. 
aragorn It will not be our end, but his. 
elrond You ride to war, but not to victory. Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know. But, in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river. A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south. They'll be in the city in two days. You're outnumbered. You need more Men. 
aragorn There are none. 
elrond There are those who dwell in the mountain. 
aragorn Murderers... traitors! You would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing! They answer to no one! 
elrond They will answer to the King of Gondor! 
elrond Andúril, Flame of the West, forged from the Shards of Narsil. 
aragorn Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.  The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith. 
elrond The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. Put aside the Ranger. Become who you were born to be. Take the Dimholt road. 
elrond Ónen i-Estel Edain.  
aragorn Ú-chebin estel anim.  
éowyn Why are you doing this? The war lies to the east; you cannot leave on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon the Men. 
aragorn Éowyn. 
éowyn We need you here. 
aragorn  Why have you come? 
éowyn Do you not know? 
aragorn It is but a shadow and a thought that you love. I cannot give you what you seek. 
gimli Just where do you think you're off to? 
aragorn Not this time. This time you must stay, Gimli. 
legolas Have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves? 
gimli You might as well accept it. We're going with you, laddie. 
soldier What's happening? Where is he going? I don't understand. Lord Aragorn! Why does he leave on the eve of battle? 
gamling He leaves because there is no hope. Th
éoden He leaves because he must. 
gamling Too few have come. We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor. Th
éoden No, we cannot. But we will meet them in battle nonetheless. Th
éoden I have left instruction. The people are to follow your rule in my stead. Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill. 
éowyn  What other duty would you have me do, My Lord? Th
éoden  Duty? No...I would have you smile again.  Not grieve for those whose time has come. You shall live to see these days renewed. No more despair. 
gimli What kind of an army would linger in such a place? 
legolas One that is cursed. Long ago the Men of the Mountain swore an oath to the last King of Gondor, to come to his aid, to fight. But when the time came, when Gondor's need was dire, they fled. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest until they had fulfilled their oath. 
gimli The very warmth of my blood seems drawn away. 
legolas The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead, and The Dead keep it. The way is shut. 
aragorn Brego! 
aragorn I do not fear death! 
gimli Well, this is a thing unheard of. An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not! Ah, I'd never hear the end of it! Th
éoden We must ride light and swift. It's a long road ahead, and Man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight. Th
éoden Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc. 
merry All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left behind! Th
éoden It's a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith, and none of my Riders can bear you as a burden. 
merry I want to fight! Th
éoden I will say no more. 
éowyn Ride with me. 
merry My Lady! 
éomer Form up! Move out! Th
éoden Ride! Ride now to Gondor! King of the 
dead Who enters my domain? 
aragorn One who will have your allegiance. King of the 
dead The Dead do not suffer the living to pass. 
aragorn You will suffer me. King of the 
dead The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead and The Dead keep it. The way is shut. Now you must die. 
aragorn I summon you to fulfill your oath. King of the 
dead None but the King of Gondor may command me. King of the 
dead That line was broken! [Ed. 
note this line is difficult to hear. I personally believe the King is saying "line" . The word that also makes sense is "blade", but it doesn't really sound like that when you listen closely. We'll have to wait till the close-captioned version of the movie comes out on DVD to know for sure.] 
aragorn It has been remade.  Fight for us, and regain your honor.  What say you? 
aragorn What say you? 
gimli You waste your time, Aragorn! They had no honor in life, they have none now in death. 
aragorn I am Isildur's heir! Fight for me, and I will hold your oaths fulfilled! 
aragorn  What say you?! 
soldier Open the gate, quick! 
soldier Quick, hurry! 
denethor Faramir! 
denethor Say not that he has fallen! 
soldier They were outnumbered. None survived. 
gothmog Fear. The city is rank with it. Let us ease their pain. Release the prisoners! 
orc Catapults! 
denethor My sons are spent... 
denethor My line has ended!

denethor The House of Stewards has failed! 
pippin He needs medicine, My Lord! 
denethor My line has ended! 
pippin  My Lord.

gandalf Prepare for battle! 
gandalf Come on, Men. To the wall! Defend the wall…

soldier Down to the lower level. Quick! 
gandalf Hold them back. Do not give into fear! Stay at your posts! 
gandalf  Not at the towers. Aim for the Trolls! Kill the Trolls! 
gandalf Peregrin Took, go back to the Citadel! 
pippin  They called us out to fight. 
gandalf This is no place for a Hobbit! 
gandalf  Guard of the Citadel indeed. Now, back! Up the hill! Quickly! Quick! Armies of 
sauron  Grond! Grond! Grond! 
gollum In there.  
frodo  What is this place? 
gollum Master must go inside the tunnel. 
frodo Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to. 
gollum It's the only way. Go in, or go back. 
frodo  I can't go back.  What's that smell? 
gollum Orcses filth. Orcses come in here sometimes.  Hurry! This way! 
frodo Sméagol?  
gollum Over here! 
frodo It's sticky! What is it? 
gollum  You will see! Oh, yes! You will see. 
frodo Sméagol? Sméagol! Sméagol!  Sam…  
galadriel  And you, Frodo Baggins, I give you the light of Eärendil, our most beloved star. 
galadriel  May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out. 
frodo Aiya Eärendil Elenion Ancalima!  
gollum Naughty little fly, why does it cry? Caught in her web, soon you'll be...eaten. 
gollum Got away, did it, Precious? Not this time! Not this time! 
gollum It wasn't us! It wasn't us! Sméagol wouldn't hurt master. We promised. You must believe us. It was the Precious! The Precious made us do it! 
frodo I have to destroy it, Sméagol. I have to destroy it for both our sakes. 
frodo I'm so sorry, Sam. So sorry. 
galadriel This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire. If you do not find a way, no one will. 
gandalf Back to the gate! Hurry! 
denethor No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long, slow, sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old. Bring wood and oil! 
gandalf Steady, steady! 
gandalf You are soldiers of Gondor. No matter what comes through that gate, you will stand your ground. 
gandalf Volley! Fire! 
sam Let him go, you filth! 
sam Let him go! 
sam You will not touch him again! 
sam Come on and finish it! 
sam Back! 
sam Mister Frodo! 
sam Oh no! Frodo! 
sam Mister Frodo! 
sam Wake up! Don't leave me here alone! Don't go where I can't follow! Wake up! 
sam Not asleep...dead! 
shagrat What's this? Looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun. 
gorbag Killed another one, has she? 
shagrat No, this fellow ain't dead. 
sam  Not dead! 
shagrat She jabs him with her stinger and he goes as limp as a boned fish. Then she has her way with them. That's how she likes to feed...fresh blood. Get him to the tower! 
sam Samwise, you fool! 
gorbag This scum will be awake in a couple of hours. 
shagrat Then he'll wish he'd never been born! 
denethor The house of his spirit crumbles. He is burning. Already burning. 
pippin  He's not dead! He's not dead! 
denethor Hear now, Peregrin, son of Paladin, I release you from my service. Go now and die in what way seems best to you. 
denethor Pour oil on the wood! 
pippin Gandalf! Where is Gandalf? Gandalf! 
gandalf Retreat! The city is breached. Fall back! To the second level! Get the women and children out. Get them out! 
gothmog Move into the city. Kill all in your path. 
gandalf Fight! Fight to the last man! Fight for your lives! 
éowyn Courage, Merry. Courage for our friends.  
gothmog Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks. Pikes in front, archers behind. Th
éoden Éomer, take your éored down the left flank. Gamling, follow the King's banner down the center. Grimbold, take your company right, after you pass the wall. Forth, and fear no darkness! Th
éoden Arise! Arise, Riders of Théoden! Th
éoden Spears shall be shaken! Shields shall be splintered! A sword day! A red day! Ere the sun rises!

gandalf Come!  
denethor Set a fire in our flesh. 
gandalf Stay this madness! 
denethor No! You will not take my son from me! 
denethor Faramir. 
gandalf So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

éoden Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down! 
éowyn Merry! 
pippin I didn't think it would end this way. 
gandalf End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path, one that we all must take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it. 
pippin What? Gandalf? See what? 
gandalf White shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise. 
pippin Well, that isn't so bad. 
gandalf No. No, it isn't. Th
éoden Rally to me! To me! Witch-

orc Late as usual, pirate scum! There's knife work here that needs doing. Come on, ya sea rats! Get off your ships! 
gimli  There's plenty for the both of us, may the best Dwarf win! Witch-
king  You fool, no man can kill me! Die now… 
éowyn I am no man! 
legolas  15, 16...

gimli …29…

legolas  33, 34... 
gimli That still only counts as one! Th
éoden  I know your face...Éowyn. Th
éoden My eyes darken. 
éowyn  No. No, I am going to save you. Th
éoden  You already did. Éowyn, my body is broken. You have to let me go. I go to my fathers in whose mighty company I shall not now feel ashamed.  Éowyn... King of the 
dead Release us. 
gimli Bad idea. Very handy in a tight spot, these lads, despite the fact they're dead. King of the 
dead You gave us your word. 
aragorn I hold your oath fulfilled. Go, be at peace. 
pippin  Merry! Merry, it's me.  It's Pippin. 
merry  I knew you'd find me. 
pippin Yes. 
merry Are you going to leave me? 
pippin No, Merry. I'm going to look after you. 
shagrat Hands off! That shiny shirt, that's mine! 
gorbag It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else. 
shagrat I don't take orders from stinking Morgul rats! 
gorbag You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut. 
shagrat The scum tried to knife me. Kill him! 
sam  That's for Frodo!  And for the Shire!  And that's for my old Gaffer! 
gorbag Stop your squealing, you dung hill rat.  I'm going to bleed you like a stuck pig! 
sam Not if I stick you first. 
frodo Sam! 
frodo Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry. Sorry for everything. 
sam Let's get you out of here.  
frodo  It's too late. It's over. They've taken it. Sam, they took the Ring. 
sam Beggin', your pardon, but they haven't.  I thought I'd lost you, so I took it. Only for safekeeping.  
frodo Give it to me.  Give me the Ring, Sam.  Sam! Give me the Ring! 
frodo You must understand, the Ring is my burden. It will destroy you, Sam. 
sam Come on, Mister Frodo. We'd best find you some clothes. You can't go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin.  
sam We did it, Mister Frodo. We made it to Mordor. 
frodo There's so many of them. We'll never get through unseen.  It's him…the Eye! 
sam We have to go in there, Mister Frodo. There's nothing for it.  Come on, let's just make it down the hill for starters. 
gandalf Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening. 
aragorn If Sauron had the Ring we would know it. 
gandalf It's only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping. 
gimli  Let him stay there. Let him rot! Why should we care? 
gandalf Because ten thousand Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.  I've sent him to his death. 
aragorn  No. There's still hope for Frodo. He needs time, and safe passage across the Plains of Gorgoroth. We can give him that. 
gimli How? 
aragorn Draw out Sauron's armies. Empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate. 
éomer We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms. 
aragorn Not for ourselves, but we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves. 
legolas A diversion. 
gandalf  Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait. 
gimli Certainty of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for? 
orc To the gate, you slugs!  Move out! To the gate! 
sam Look, the Orcs! They're moving off. You see, Mister Frodo, some luck at last. 
sam Take mine, there's a few drops left. 
frodo There'll be none left for the return journey. 
sam I don't think there will be a return journey, Mister Frodo. 
sam Frodo! Get down! Hide! 
sam Frodo! 
pippin Where are they? 
aragorn Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth. Let justice be done upon him. 
aragorn Fall back! Fall back!  
sam It's gone, Mister Frodo. The light's passed on, away towards the North. Something's drawn its gaze.  
aragorn Hold your ground! Hold your ground. 
aragorn Sons of Gondor! Of Rohan! My brothers. I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of the West! 
gimli Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf. 
legolas What about side by side with a friend? 
gimli Aye, I could do that. 
sam Do you remember the Shire, Mister Frodo? It'll be spring soon, and the Orchards will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket and they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields.  And eating the first of the strawberries with cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries? 
frodo  No, Sam, I can't recall the taste of food. Nor the sound of water. Or the touch of grass. I'm naked in the dark. There's nothing…no veil between me and the wheel of fire. I can see him with my waking eyes!  
sam  Then let us be rid of it, once and for all! Come on, Mister Frodo. I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you! Come on! Sauron's 
voice Aragorn...Elessar... 
aragorn For Frodo… 
sam Look, Mister Frodo. A doorway! We're almost there. 
gollum Clever Hobbits, to climb so high! 
sam  Frodo! 
pippin  Eagles! The Eagles are coming!  
sam Frodo! 
frodo I'm here, Sam. 
sam Destroy it! 
sam Go on. Now! Throw it in the fire. 
sam What are you waiting for? Just let it go! 
frodo The Ring is mine! 
sam No...no… 
sam Nooooooo! 
gollum Precious, precious, precious, precious! 
sam Give me your hand! 
sam Take my hand! 
sam No! 
sam Don't you let go! Don't let go. Reach! 
merry  Frodo! 
frodo It's gone. It's done. 
sam Yes, Mister Frodo. It's over now. 
frodo I can see the Shire…the Brandywine River…Bag End…Gandalf's fireworks…the lights in the Party Tree. 
sam  Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it would've been her. It would've been her.  
frodo I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things. 
frodo  Gandalf? 
merry Frodo! 
frodo  Gimli! 
frodo  Aragorn. 
gandalf Now come the days of the king.  May they be blessed. 
aragorn  This day does not belong to one man but to all. Let us together rebuild this world that we may share in the days of peace. Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta. 
aragorn Hannon le.  
aragorn  My friends. You bow to no one. 
frodo  And thus it was, the Fourth Age of Middle-earth began, and the Fellowship of the Ring, though eternally bound by friendship and love, was ended.  Thirteen months to the day, since Gandalf sent us on our long journey, we found ourselves looking upon a familiar site. 
frodo We were home. 
frodo How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on, when in your heart, you begin to understand, there is no going back?  There are some things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep…that have taken hold. 
sam Mr. Frodo? What is it? 
frodo  It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed. 
sam 'There and Back again, a Hobbit's Tale by Bilbo Baggins'…and 'The Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins.' You finished it. 
frodo Not quite. There's room for a little more.  
frodo  Bilbo once told me, his part in this tale would end. That each of must come and go in the telling. Bilbo's story was now over. There would be no more journeys for him…save one. 
bilbo Tell me again, lad...where are we going? 
frodo To the harbor, Uncle. The elves have accorded you a special honor. A place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth. 
bilbo Frodo, any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again? Hmm? The one I gave you? 
frodo  I'm sorry, Uncle. I'm afraid I lost it. 
bilbo Oh. Did ye? I should like to have held it, one last time. 
bilbo  Oh! Here is a sight that I have never seen before. 
galadriel The power of the three rings is ended. The time has come for the Dominion of Men. 
elrond I Aear can ven na mar.  
bilbo  I think I'm quite ready for another adventure. 
gandalf Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now finished. Here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship. 
gandalf I will not say, do not weep, for not all tears are an evil.  It is time, Frodo. 
sam What does he mean? 
frodo We set out to save the Shire, Sam. And it has been saved. But not for me. 
sam  You don't mean that. You can't leave! 
frodo  The last pages are for you, Sam. 
frodo  My dear Sam, you cannot always be torn in two. You will have to be one and whole for many years. 
frodo  You have so much to enjoy and to be, and to do. Your part in this story will go on. 
sam Well, I'm back.

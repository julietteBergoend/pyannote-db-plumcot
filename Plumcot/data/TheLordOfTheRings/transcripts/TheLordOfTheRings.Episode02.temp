eowyn Now the wildmen are moving through the Westfold , burning as they go .
eowyn Rick , cot and tree .
freda Where's mama ?
eowyn Shh ...
gandalf This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash .
gandalf All the more potent for he is driven mad by fear of Sauron .
gandalf Ride out and meet him head on .
gandalf Draw him away from your women and children .
gandalf You must fight .
aragorn You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak .
theoden They will be three hundred leagues from here by now .
theoden Eomer cannot help us .
theoden I know what it is that you want of me .
theoden But I will not bring further death to my people .
theoden I will not risk open war .
aragorn Open war is upon you .
aragorn Whether you would risk it or not .
theoden When last I looked , Theoden , not Aragorn , was king of Rohan .
gandalf Then what is the king's decision ?
hama By order of the king , the city must empty .
hama We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep .
hama Do not burden yourselves with treasures .
hama Take only what provisions you need .
gimli Helm's Deep !
gimli They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight .
gimli Who will defend them if not their king .
aragorn He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people .
aragorn Helm's Deep has saved them in the past .
gandalf There is no way out of that ravine .
gandalf Theoden is walking into a trap .
gandalf He thinks he's leading them to safety .
gandalf What they will get is a massacre .
gandalf Theoden has a strong will but I fear for him .
gandalf I fear for the survival of Rohan .
gandalf He will need you before the end , Aragorn .
gandalf The people of Rohan will need you .
gandalf The defences HAVE to hold .
aragorn They will hold .
gandalf The Grey Pilgrim ...
gandalf that's what they used to call me .
gandalf Three hundred lives of men I've walked this earth
gandalf and now I have no time .
gandalf Good luck .
gandalf My search will not be in vain .
gandalf Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day .
gandalf At dawn , look to the East .
aragorn Go .
aragorn You have some skill with a blade .
eowyn Women of this country learned long ago that those without swords may still die upon them .
eowyn I fear neither death nor pain .
aragorn What do you fear , my lady ?
eowyn A cage .
eowyn To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire .
aragorn You are a daughter of kings , a shieldmaiden of Rohan .
aragorn I do not think that will be your fate .
grima Theoden will not stay at Edoras .
grima It's vulnerable , he knows this .
grima He will expect an attack on the city .
grima They will flee to Helm's Deep , the great fortress of Rohan .
grima It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains .
grima They will be slow .
grima They will have women and children with them .
saruman Send out your warg riders .

gimli It's true you don't see many Dwarf women .
gimli And in fact , they are so alike in voice and appearence , haha that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men .
aragorn It's the beards ... .
gimli And this , in turn , has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women .
gimli And that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground !
eowyn Hahahaha! !
gimli Hehehe !
gimli Which is of course ridiculous ...
gimli Whoa! !
eowyn Ooh !
gimli It's alright
gimli , it's alright .
gimli Nobody panic .
gimli That was deliberate .
gimli It was deliberate .
arwen The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane ...
arwen It is mine to give to whom I will ...

aragorn I am asleep .
aragorn This is a dream .
arwen Then it is a good dream .
arwen Sleep ...
eowyn Where is she ?
eowyn The woman who gave you that jewel .
elrond Our time here is ending .
elrond Arwen's time is ending .
elrond Let her go .
elrond Let her take the ship into the west .
elrond Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands .
elrond There it will be evergreen .
aragorn But never more than a memory .
elrond I will not leave my daughter here to die .
aragorn She stays because she still has hope .
elrond She stays for YOU !
elrond She belongs with her people !
arwen Why are you saying this ?
aragorn I am mortal ; you are Elfkind .
aragorn It was a dream , Arwen , nothing more .
aragorn This belongs to you .
arwen It was a gift .
arwen Keep it .
eowyn My lord ?
aragorn She is sailing to the Undying Lands , with all that is left of her kin .

gimli My lady ...
eowyn Lord Aragorn , where is he ?
gimli He fell ...
theoden Draw our forces behind the wall .
theoden Bar the gate , and set a watch on the surround .
gamling What of those who cannot fight , my lord ?
gamling The women and children ?
theoden Get them into the cave .
theoden Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here .
grima Helm's Deep has one weakness .
grima It's outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain .
grima How ?
grima How can fire undo stone ?
grima What kind of device could bring down the wall ?
saruman If the wall is breached , Helm's Deep will fall .
grima Even if it is breached , it would take a number beyond reckoning , thousands to storm the keep .
saruman Tens of thousands .
grima But , my lord , there is no such force .
saruman A new power is rising .
saruman Its victory is at hand !
saruman This night , the land would be stained with the blood of Rohan !
saruman March to Helms Deep !
saruman Leave none alive !
saruman To war! !
saruman There will be no dawn for Men .
pippin Look !
pippin There's smoke to the south !
treebeard There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days .
merry Isengard ?
treebeard There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods .
treebeard But now he has a mind of metal and wheels .
treebeard He no longer cares for growing things .
pippin What is it ?
merry It's Saruman's army !
merry The war has started .
arwen May the grace of the Valar protect you .
arwen I have made my choice .
elrond He is not coming back .
elrond Why do you linger here when there is no hope ?
arwen There is still hope .
elrond If Aragorn survives this war , you will still be parted .
elrond If Sauron is defeated , and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true , you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality .
elrond Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time , Aragorn will die .
elrond And there will be no comfort for you .
elrond No comfort to ease the pain of his passing .
elrond He will come to death , an image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world .
elrond But you , my daughter , you will linger on in darkness and in doubt .
elrond As nightfall in winter that comes without a star .
elrond Here you will dwell , bound to your grief , under the fading trees , until all the world has changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent .
galadriel The power of the enemy is growing .
galadriel Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan .
galadriel Isengard has been unleashed .
galadriel The eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor , the last free kingdom of men .
galadriel His war on this country will come swiftly .
galadriel He senses the Ring is close .
galadriel The strength of the Ringbearer is failing .
galadriel In his heart , Frodo begins to understand .
galadriel The quest will claim his life .
galadriel You know this .
galadriel You have foreseen it .
galadriel It is the risk we all took .
galadriel In the gathering dark , the will of the Ring grows strong .
galadriel It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men .
galadriel Men , who are so easily seduced by its power .
galadriel The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hands , take the Ring for his own and the world will fall .
galadriel It is close now , so close to achieving its goal .
galadriel For Sauron will have dominion of all life on this Earth , even until the ending of the world .
galadriel The time of the Elves is over .
galadriel Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate ?
galadriel Do we let them stand alone ?

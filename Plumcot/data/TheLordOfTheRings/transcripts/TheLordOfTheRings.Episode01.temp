galadriel The world is changed .
galadriel I feel it in the water .
galadriel I feel it in the earth .
galadriel I smell it in the air .
galadriel Much that once was is lost , for none now live who remember it .
galadriel It began with the forging of the Rings of Power .
galadriel Three were given to the Elves , immortal , wisest and fairest of all beings .
galadriel Seven were given to the Dwarves , great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls .
galadriel And nine , nine rings were gifted to the race of Men , who above all else desire power .
galadriel For within these rings was bound the power and the will to rule each race .
galadriel But they were all of them deceived , for deep in the land of Mordor , the Dark Lord Sauron forged another ring , a master ring , and into this ring he poured all his cruelty , his malice and his will to dominate every living thing .
galadriel One ring to rule them all .
galadriel One by one , the free peoples of Middle Earth fell to the power of the Ring , but there were some who resisted .
galadriel A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor , and on the very slopes of Mount Doom , they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth .
galadriel Victory was near , but the power of the ring could not be undone .
galadriel It was in this moment , when all hope had faded , that Isildur , son of the king , took up his father's sword .
galadriel And Sauron , enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth , was defeated .
galadriel The Ring passed to Isildur , who had this one chance to destroy evil forever , but the hearts of men are easily corrupted .
galadriel And the ring of power has a will of its own .
galadriel It betrayed Isildur , to his death .
galadriel And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost .
galadriel History became legend .
galadriel Legend became myth .
galadriel For two and a half thousand years , the ring passed out of all knowledge .
galadriel Until , when chance came , the ring ensnared another bearer .
gollum My Precious , my own .
galadriel The ring came to the creature Gollum , who took it deep into the tunnels under the Misty Mountains , and there it consumed him .
gollum It came to me , my own , my love , my Precious .
galadriel The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life .
galadriel For five hundred years it poisoned his mind , and in the gloom of Gollum's cave it waited .
galadriel Darkness crept back into the forests of the world .
galadriel Rumor grew of a shadow in the East , whispers of a nameless fear , and the Ring of Power perceived that its time had come .
galadriel It abandoned Gollum , but then something happened that the Ring did not intend .
galadriel It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable .
galadriel A hobbit , Bilbo Baggins , of the Shire .
bilbo What's this ?
bilbo A Ring !
gollum Lost !
gollum My Precious is lost !
galadriel For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all .
frodo You're late .
gandalf A wizard is never late , Frodo Baggins , nor is he early .
gandalf He arrives precisely when he means to .
frodo It's wonderful to see you again , Gandalf .
gandalf You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday .
frodo What's new in the world ?
frodo Tell me everything .
gandalf Haven't we grown curious ?
gandalf Most unnatural for a hobbit .
gandalf What can I tell you ?
gandalf Life in the wide world goes on , much as it has this past age , full of its own comings and goings , scarcely aware of the existence of hobbits .
gandalf For which I am very grateful .
gandalf Ah , the long-expected party .
gandalf How is the old rascal ?
gandalf I understand this is to be a party of special magnificence .
frodo You know Bilbo .
frodo He has the whole place in an uproar .
gandalf Well , that should please him .
frodo Half the Shire's been invited .
frodo He's up to something .
gandalf Indeed ?
frodo All right , keep your secrets .
frodo Before you came along , we Bagginses were very well thought of .
frodo Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected .
gandalf If you're referring to that incident with the dragon , I was barely involved .
gandalf I only gave your uncle a little nudge out the door .
frodo Whatever you did , you have been officially labeled a disturber of the peace .
children#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode01 Gandalf , Gandalf !
children#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Episode01 Fireworks , Gandalf !
frodo Gandalf , I'm glad you're back .
gandalf So am I , dear boy , so am I.
bilbo No thank you !
bilbo We don't want any more well- wishers , visitors , or distant relations !
gandalf How about very old friends ?
bilbo Gandalf ?
gandalf Bilbo Baggins !
bilbo My dear Gandalf !
gandalf One hundred and eleven years old !
gandalf Who would believe it ?
gandalf You haven't aged a day .
bilbo Come in , come in , welcome , would you like some tea ?
bilbo Or perhaps something stronger .
bilbo I still have some of the Old Winyards left .
bilbo 1296 , a very good year !
bilbo Almost as old as I am !
bilbo My Father put it down .
bilbo What say we open one ?
gandalf Just tea , thank you .
bilbo I was expecting you last week , but you come and go as you please ...
bilbo I can make you some eggs if you like ...
gandalf Just tea .
bilbo Yes , right , you don't mind if I do ?
gandalf Oh , no , not at all .
bilbo I'm not at home !
bilbo I need to get away from these confounded relatives , hanging on the bell all day , never giving me a moment's rest .
bilbo I want to see mountains again , Gandalf , mountains !
bilbo And then find someplace quiet where I can finish my book .
bilbo Oh , right , the tea .
gandalf You mean to go through with your plan , then ?
bilbo Yes , everything's in hand .
bilbo The arrangements have all been made .
gandalf Frodo suspects .
bilbo Of course he suspects , he's a Baggins , not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle !
gandalf You will tell him , won't you ?
bilbo Yes , yes .
gandalf He's very fond of you , you know .
bilbo I know .
bilbo He'd probably come with me if I asked him to , but I think in his heart Frodo is still in love with the Shire .
bilbo The woods , the fields , little rivers .
bilbo I'm old , Gandalf .
bilbo I know I don't look it , but I begin to feel it in my heart .
bilbo I feel thin , stretched , like butter scraped over too much bread .
bilbo I need a holiday , a very long holiday , and I don't expect I shall return .
bilbo In fact , I mean not to !
bilbo Old Toby !
bilbo Finest weed in Southfarthing .
bilbo Gandalf , my old friend , this will be a night to remember !
frodo Go on , Sam , ask Rosie for a dance !
sam I think I'll just have another ale .
frodo Oh , no you don't !
bilbo So there I was , at the mercy of three monstrous trolls , and they were arguing about how to cook us !
bilbo Whether it be turned on a spit , or if they should sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly !
bilbo They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and whyfors that the first light of the sun crept up over the tops of the trees and turned them all to stone !
merry Not that one !
merry The big one , the big one !
pippin There !
merry You're supposed to put it in the ground first !
pippin It is in the ground !
merry Outside !
pippin This was your idea !
frodo Bilbo , watch out for the dragon !
bilbo Nonsense , there hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years !
pippin That was good !
merry Let's get another one !
gandalf Meriadoc Brandybuck , and Peregrin Took .
gandalf I might have known .
bilbo My dear Bagginses and Boffins , Tooks and Brandybucks , Gubbs , Chubbs , Hornblowers , Bolgers , Bracegirdles and Proudfoots !
hobbit Proudfeet !
bilbo Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday !
bilbo Alas , eleventy one years is much too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits !
bilbo I don't know half of you half as well as I should like
bilbo and I like less than half of you half as well as
bilbo you deserve !
bilbo I have things to do .
bilbo I've put this off for far too long .
bilbo I regret to announce this is the end !
bilbo I'm going now .
bilbo I bid you all a very fond farewell !
bilbo Goodbye .
gandalf I suppose you thought that was terribly clever .
bilbo Come on , Gandalf !
bilbo Did you see their faces ?
gandalf There are
gandalf a good many magic rings in the world , Bilbo , and none of them should be used lightly !
bilbo It was just a bit of fun .
bilbo Oh , I suppose you're right , as usual .
bilbo You will keep an eye on Frodo , won't you ?
gandalf Two eyes , as often as I can spare them .
bilbo I'm leaving everything to him .
gandalf And this ring of yours , is that staying , too ?
bilbo Yes , it's in an envelope , on the mantelpiece .
bilbo Wait , no , it's here in my pocket .
bilbo Isn't that odd , now ?
bilbo Yet , why not ?
bilbo Why shouldn't I keep it ?
gandalf I think you should leave the ring behind .
gandalf Is that so hard ?
bilbo Well , no ,
bilbo and yes .
bilbo Now it comes to it .
bilbo I don't feel like parting with it !
bilbo I found it !
bilbo It came to me !
gandalf There's no need to get angry .
bilbo And what if I'm angry !
bilbo It's your fault !
bilbo It's mine .
bilbo My own , my precious ...
gandalf Precious ?
gandalf It's been called that before , but not by you .
bilbo What business is it of yours what I do with my own things ?
gandalf I think you've had that ring quite long enough .
bilbo You want it for yourself !
gandalf Do not take me for some conjuror of cheap tricks !
gandalf I am not trying to rob you !
gandalf I'm trying to help you .
gandalf All your long years , we have been friends .
gandalf Trust me now as you once did .
gandalf Let it go .
bilbo You're right .
bilbo The ring must go to Frodo .
bilbo It's late , and the road is long .
bilbo Yes , it is time .
gandalf Bilbo , the ring is still in your pocket .
bilbo Oh , yes .
bilbo I've thought of an ending for my book . '
bilbo And he lived happily ever after , to the end of his days.'
gandalf And I'm sure you will , old friend .
bilbo Good bye , Gandalf .
gandalf Goodbye , dear Bilbo .
gandalf Until our next meeting .
bilbo It's mine , my own , my precious .
gandalf Riddles in the dark ...
gandalf Precious ...
frodo Bilbo !
frodo He's gone , hasn't he ?
frodo He talked about it for so long
frodo , I never really believed he would do it .
frodo Gandalf ?
gandalf Bilbo's Ring .
gandalf He's gone to stay with the elves .
gandalf He's left you Bag End , along with all his possessions .
gandalf The Ring is yours now .
gandalf Put it somewhere out of sight .
frodo Where are you going ?
gandalf There are things I need to see to .
frodo What things ?
gandalf Questions , questions that need answering .
frodo But you've only just arrived !
frodo I don't understand .
gandalf Neither do I. Keep it secret .
gandalf Keep it safe .
hobbit No Bagginses here .
hobbit They're all up in Hobbitton .
hobbit That way .
gandalf Is it secret ?
gandalf Is it safe ?
frodo What are you doing ?
gandalf Hold out your hand , Frodo .
gandalf It's quite cool .
gandalf What can you see ?
gandalf Can you see anything ?
frodo Nothing .
frodo There's nothing .
frodo Wait .
frodo There are markings .
frodo It's some form of Elvish , but I can't read it .
gandalf There are few who can .
gandalf The language is that of Mordor , which I shall not utter here .
frodo Mordor ?
gandalf In the common tongue , it reads , One ring to rule them all , one ring to find them .
gandalf One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them .
gandalf This is the One Ring , forged by Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom .
gandalf Isildur took it from the hand of Sauron himself .
frodo Bilbo found it , in Gollum's cave .
gandalf For sixty years , it lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping , prolonging his life , delaying old age .
gandalf But no longer .
gandalf There is evil stirring in Mordor .
gandalf The Ring has awoken .
gandalf It's heard its master's call .
frodo But he was destroyed .
frodo Sauron was destroyed .
gandalf No , Frodo .
gandalf His spirit endured .
gandalf Sauron's life- force was bound to the Ring , and the Ring survived .
gandalf Sauron has returned .
gandalf His orcs have multiplied .
gandalf His fortress of Barad-Dur is rebuilt in Mordor .
gandalf He needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness .
gandalf He is seeking it , seeking it , all his thought is bent on it .
gandalf The Ring yearns above all else to return to the hand of its master .
gandalf They are one , the Ring and the Dark Lord .
gandalf He must never find it .
frodo All right , we keep it hidden .
frodo We put it away , we never speak of it again .
frodo Nobody knows its here , do they ?
frodo Do they , Gandalf ?
gandalf There was one other who knew that Bilbo had the ring .
gandalf I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum , but the Enemy found him first .
gandalf I don't know how long they tortured him , but amid the endless screams and inane babble , they heard two words .
gandalf Shire .
gandalf Baggins .
frodo Shire .
frodo Baggins .
frodo But that would lead them here !
frodo Take it , Gandalf , you must take it !
gandalf You cannot offer me this Ring !
frodo I am giving it to you !
gandalf Don't tempt me !
gandalf I dare not take this Ring , not even to keep it safe !
gandalf Understand , I would use this Ring out of a desire to do good , but through me , it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine .
frodo But it cannot stay in the Shire !
gandalf No .
gandalf No , it can't .
frodo What must I do ?
gandalf You must go , and go quickly .
frodo Where ?
gandalf Get out of the Shire .
gandalf Make for the village of Bree .
frodo What about you ?
gandalf I will wait for you at the Inn of the Prancing Pony .
frodo And the Ring will be safe there ?
gandalf I don't know , Frodo .
gandalf I don't have any answers .
gandalf I must see the head of my order .
gandalf He is both powerful and wise .
gandalf Trust me , he will know what to do .
gandalf You must leave the name of Baggins behind you , for that name is not safe outside the Shire .
gandalf Travel only by day , and stay off the road .
frodo I can cut across country easily enough .
gandalf Dear Frodo .
gandalf Hobbits are the most amazing creatures .
gandalf You can learn everything there is to know about their ways in a month , and after a hundred years they can still surprise you !
gandalf Get down !
gandalf Confound it all , Samwise Gamgee , have you been eavesdropping ?
sam I ain't been dropping no eaves , sir , honest , I was just cutting the grass outside the window , if you follow me .
gandalf A bit late for trimming the verge .
sam I heard raised voices .
gandalf What did you hear ?
gandalf Speak !
sam Nothing important .
sam That is , I heard a good deal about a ring , and a dark lord , and something about the end of the world .
sam Please don't hurt me , sir , don't turn me into anything unnatural .
gandalf No ?
gandalf Perhaps not .
gandalf I've thought of a better use for you .
gandalf Come along , Samwise , keep up !
gandalf Be careful , both of you .
gandalf The enemy has many spies in his service .
gandalf Birds , beasts .
gandalf Is it safe ?
gandalf Never put it on !
gandalf The servants of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power .
gandalf Remember , the Ring is trying to get back to its master .
gandalf It wants to be found .
sam This is it .
frodo This is what ?
sam If I take one more step , it will be the farthest from home
sam I've ever been .
frodo Come on , Sam .
frodo Remember what Bilbo used to say .
frodo It's a dangerous thing , Frodo , going out your door .
frodo You step onto the road , and if you don't keep your feet , there's no knowing where you'll be swept off to .
saruman_ Smoke rises from the mountain of Doom .
saruman_ The hour grows late , and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my council .
saruman_ For that is why you have come , is it not , my old friend ?
gandalf Saruman .
saruman_ You are sure of this ?
gandalf Beyond any doubt .
saruman_ So the One Ring has been found .
gandalf All these long years it was in the Shire , right under my nose .
saruman_ And you had not the wit to see it .
saruman_ Your love of the Halflings' leaf has clearly slowed your mind .
gandalf We still have time , time to counter Sauron , if we act quickly .
saruman_ Time ?
saruman_ What time do you think we have ?
saruman_ Sauron has regained much of his former strength .
saruman_ He cannot yet take physical form , but his spirit has lost none of its potency .
saruman_ Concealed in his fortress he sees all .
saruman_ His gaze pierces cloud , shadow , earth and flesh .
saruman_ You know of what I speak .
saruman_ A great eye , lidless , wreathed in flame .
gandalf The Eye of Sauron .
saruman_ He is gathering all evil to him .
saruman_ Very soon he will have assembled an army large enough to assault Middle-earth .
gandalf You know this ?
gandalf How ?
saruman_ I have seen it .
gandalf A Palantir is a dangerous tool .
saruman_ Why ?
saruman_ Why should we fear to use it ?
gandalf They are not all accounted for , the lost seeing stones .
gandalf You do not know who else may be watching .
saruman_ The hour is later than you think .
saruman_ Sauron's forces are already moving .
saruman_ The Nine have left Minas Mordor .
gandalf The Nine ?
saruman_ They crossed the river Isen on midsummer's eve , disguised as riders in black .
gandalf They have reached the Shire !
saruman_ They will find the Ring , and kill the one who carries it .
gandalf Frodo !
saruman_ You did not truly think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron ?
saruman_ There are none who can .
saruman_ Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory .
saruman_ We must join him , Gandalf .
saruman_ Join with Sauron .
saruman_ It would be wise , old friend .
gandalf Tell me , friend , when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness ?
saruman_ I offered you the choice of aiding me willingly , but you have elected the way of pain !
sam Mister Frodo ?
sam Frodo !
sam I thought I'd lost you .
frodo What are you talking about , Sam ?
sam It's just something Gandalf said .
frodo What did he say ?
sam Don't you lose him , Samwise Gamgee .
sam And I don't mean to .
frodo We're still in the Shire , Sam , what could possibly happen ?
pippin Frodo !
pippin Look , Merry , it's Frodo !
sam You get off him !

pippin And the mushrooms the week before that .
merry Yes , Pippin !
merry My point is , he's obviously overreacting !
pippin Ooh !
pippin That was a close one .
merry I think I've broken something .
sam Trust a Brandybuck and a Took !
merry Nonsense !
merry That was just a detour !
merry A shortcut !
sam Shortcut to what ?
pippin Mushrooms !
frodo I think we should get off the road .
frodo Get off the road , quick !
pippin What was that ?
frodo Nothing .
merry That dark rider was looking for something , or someone .
merry Frodo ?
frodo I have to leave the Shire .
frodo Sam and I have to get to Bree .
merry Bucklebury ferry .
merry Follow me .
merry Sam , get the ropes !
frodo Go !

aragorn A little more caution from you , that is no trinket you carry .

aragorn Are you frightened ?
frodo Yes .
aragorn Not nearly frightened enough .

aragorn They are coming .
frodo What are they ?
aragorn They were once men .
aragorn Great kings of men , but Sauron the Deceiver gave them nine rings of power , and , blinded by their greed , they took them without question , one by one falling into darkness .
aragorn Now they are slaves to his will .
aragorn They are the Nazgul , Ringwraiths , neither living nor dead .
aragorn At all times they feel the presence of the ring , drawn to the power of the One .
aragorn They will never stop hunting you .
frodo Where are you taking us ?
aragorn Into the wilds .

frodo Gandalf ?
gandalf Yes , I'm here .
gandalf And you're lucky to be here , too .
gandalf A few more hours
gandalf and you would have been beyond our aid , but you have some strength in you , dear hobbit .
frodo What happened ?
frodo Why didn't you meet us ?
gandalf I am sorry .
gandalf I was delayed .
saruman_ The friendship of Saruman is not lightly cast aside .
saruman_ One ill turn deserves another .
saruman_ It is over .
saruman_ Embrace the power of the Ring or embrace your own destruction .
gandalf The ring has but one master .
gandalf Only one may bend it to his will , and he does not share power .
saruman_ So you have chosen death .
frodo Gandalf , what is it ?
gandalf Nothing .
sam Bless you , Frodo , you're awake !
gandalf Sam has hardly left your side .
sam We were that worried about you , weren't we , Mr .
sam Gandalf ?
gandalf Thanks to the skills of Master Elrond , you have begun to mend .
elrond Welcome to Rivendell , Frodo Baggins .
frodo Bilbo !
bilbo Hello , Frodo , my lad !
frodo There and back again , a hobbit's tale , by Bilbo Baggins .
frodo This is wonderful !
bilbo I meant to go back , wander the paths of the Mirkwood , visit Laketown ,
bilbo see the Lonely Mountain again , but age , it seems , has finally caught up with me .
frodo I miss the Shire .
frodo I spent all my childhood pretending
frodo I was somewhere else , off with you on one of your adventures , but my own adventure turned out to be quite different .
frodo I'm not like you , Bilbo .
bilbo My dear boy .
sam Now what have I forgotten ?
frodo Packed already ?
sam Doesn't hurt to be prepared .
frodo I thought you wanted to see the elves , Sam .
sam I do .
frodo More than anything .
sam I did ,
sam but ... we did what we set off to do , didn't we ?
sam We got the ring this far , to Rivendell , and seeing as how you're on the mend , I thought we'd be off soon .
sam Off home .
frodo You're right , Sam .
frodo We did what Gandalf wanted .
frodo The Ring will be safe in Rivendell .
frodo I am ready to go home .
elrond His strength returns .
gandalf That wound will never fully heal .
gandalf He will carry it for the rest of his life .
elrond Yet to have come so far still bearing the ring , the hobbit has shown remarkable resilience to its evil .
gandalf It is a burden he should never have had to bear .
gandalf We can ask no more of Frodo .
elrond Gandalf , the Enemy is moving .
elrond Sauron's forces are massing in the East .
elrond The Eye is fixed on Rivendell .
elrond Now you tell me Saruman has betrayed us .
elrond The list of our allies grows thin .
gandalf His treachery goes deeper than you know .
gandalf At Falcraft , Saruman has crossed orcs with goblin men .
gandalf He is breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard .
gandalf An army that can move in sunlight , and travel great distances at speed .
gandalf Saruman is coming for the ring .
elrond This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves .
elrond We do not have the strength to stand against Mordor and Isengard both .
elrond The ring cannot stay here .
elrond This peril belongs to all Middle-Earth , and they must decide now how to end it .
elrond The age of elves is over .
elrond My people are leaving these shores .
elrond Who will you turn to once we are gone ?
elrond The dwarves hide in their mountains seeking riches and care not for the troubles of others .
gandalf We must place our hope in men .
elrond Men !
elrond The race of men is weak , failing .
elrond The blood of Numenor is all but spent , its pride and dignity forgotten .
elrond It is because of men that the Ring survives .
elrond I was there , three thousand years ago , when Isildur took the ring .
elrond I was there when the strength of men failed .
elrond Follow me !
elrond I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom , where it was forged , the one place it could be destroyed .
elrond Throw it in the fire !
elrond Destroy it !
isildur No .
elrond Isildur !
elrond It should have ended that day , but evil was allowed to endure .
elrond Isildur kept the Ring .
elrond The line of Kings is broken .
elrond There is no strength left in the world of men .
elrond They are scattered , divided , leaderless .
gandalf There is one who could unite them .
gandalf Who could reclaim the throne of Gondor .
elrond He turned from that path long ago .
elrond He has chosen exile .
boromir The shards of Narsil .
boromir The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand .
boromir Still sharp .
boromir But no more than a broken hilt .
arwen Why do you fear the past ?
arwen You are Isildur's heir , not Isildur himself .
arwen You are not bound to his fate .
aragorn The same blood flows in my veins , the same weakness .
arwen Your time will come .
arwen You will face the same evil , and you will defeat it .
arwen Not over you , not over me .
arwen Do you remember the first time we met ?
aragorn I thought I had strayed into a dream .
arwen Long years have passed since then .
arwen You did not have the cares you carry now .
arwen Do you remember what I told you ?
aragorn You said you would bind yourself to me , and forsake the immortal life of your people .
arwen And to that I hold .
arwen I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of the world alone .
arwen I choose a mortal life .
aragorn You cannot give me this .
arwen It is mine to give to whom I will .
arwen Like my heart .
elrond Strangers from distant lands , friends of old .
elrond You are summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor .
elrond Middle-Earth stands on the brink of destruction .
elrond You will unite or you will fall .
elrond Each race is bound to this fate , this one doom .
elrond Bring forth the ring , Frodo .
boromir It is a gift , a gift to the foes of Mordor .
boromir Why not use this Ring ?
boromir Long has my father , the Steward of Gondor , kept the forces of Mordor at bay .
boromir By the blood of my people are your lands kept safe .
boromir Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy .
boromir Let us use it against him .
aragorn You cannot wield it .
aragorn None of us can .
aragorn The ring answers to Sauron alone .
aragorn It has no other master .
boromir What would a ranger know of this matter ?
legolas He is no mere ranger .
legolas This is Aragorn , son of Arathorn .
legolas You owe him your allegiance .
boromir This is Isildur's heir ?
legolas And heir to the throne of Gondor .
aragorn Sit down , Legolas .
boromir Gondor has no king , Gondor needs no king .
gandalf Aragorn is right .
gandalf We cannot control it .
elrond We have but one choice .
elrond The ring must be destroyed .
gimli What are we waiting for ?
elrond The ring cannot be destroyed , Gimli , son of Gloin , by any craft that we here possess .
elrond It was made in the fires of Mount Doom .
elrond Only there can it be unmade .
elrond It must be taken deep into Mordor , and cast back into the fiery chasm from which it came .
elrond One of you must do this .
boromir One does not simply walk into Mordor .
boromir Its black gates are guarded by more than orcs .
boromir There is evil there that does not sleep , and the great eye is ever watchful .
boromir It is a barren wasteland , riddled with fire , ash and dust .
boromir The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume .
boromir It is folly .
boromir Not with ten thousand men could you do this .
legolas Have you heard nothing that Lord Elrond has said ?
legolas The Ring must be destroyed !
gimli And I suppose you think you're the one to do it ?
boromir And what if we fail ?
boromir What happens when Sauron takes back what is his ?
gimli I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an elf !
gimli Never trust an elf !
frodo I will take it .
frodo I will take it !
frodo I will take the ring to Mordor .
frodo Though I do not know the way .
gandalf I will help you bear this burden for as long as it is yours to bear .
aragorn If by my life or my death I can protect you , I will .
aragorn You have my sword .
legolas And my bow .
gimli And my axe .
boromir You carry the fate of us all , little one .
boromir But if this is truly the will of the council , Gondor will see it done .
sam Here !
sam Mr .
sam Frodo's not going anywhere without me .
elrond Indeed , it is hardly possible to separate the two of you , even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not .
elrond Very well .
merry We're going , too !
merry You'd have to send us home tied up in a sack to keep us away .
pippin Anyway , you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission .
pippin Quest .
pippin Thing .
merry Well , that rules you out , Pip .
elrond Nine companions .
elrond So be it .
elrond You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring .
pippin Great .
pippin Now , where are we going ?
bilbo My old sword , Sting .
bilbo Take it , take it !
frodo It's so light !
bilbo Yes .
bilbo Made by the elves , you know .
bilbo The blade glows blue when orcs are close .
bilbo And it's times like those ,
bilbo dear boy , you have to be extra careful .
bilbo Here's a pretty thing .
bilbo As light as a feather , and as hard as dragon scales .
bilbo Let me see you put it on .
bilbo Oh , my old ring .
bilbo I should very much like to hold it again , one last time .
bilbo has an evil moment , then recovers .
bilbo I'm sorry I brought this upon you , my boy .
bilbo I'm sorry you must carry this burden .
bilbo I'm sorry for everything !
gandalf We must hold to this course west of the Misty Mountains for forty days .
gandalf If our luck holds , the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us , and from there our road turns east toward Mordor .
boromir Very good .
boromir Again !
gimli If anyone were to ask my opinion , which I note they have not , I would say we're taking the long way around !
gimli Gandalf , we could go through the Mines of Moria .
gimli My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome !
gandalf No , Gimli , I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice .
aragorn Move your feet !
pippin Ow !
boromir Sorry !
sam What's that ?
gimli It's nothing , just a wisp of cloud .
boromir It's moving fast , against the wind .
legolas Crebain from Dunland !
legolas Hide !
gandalf Spies for Saruman .
gandalf The passage south is being watched .
gandalf We will have to go over the pass of Caradhras .
aragorn Boromir .
boromir It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing .
boromir Such a little thing .
aragorn Boromir !
aragorn Give the ring to Frodo .
boromir As you wish .
boromir I care not .
saruman_ So , you tried to lead them over Caradhras .
saruman_ And if that fails ?
saruman_ Where will you go ?
saruman_ If the mountain defeats you , will you risk a more dangerous road ?
legolas There is a fell voice on the air !
gandalf Saruman !
aragorn He's trying to bring down the mountain !
aragorn We must turn back !
gandalf No !
aragorn We must get off the mountain !
boromir We must take the Pass of Rohan , or take the road west to my city !
aragorn Rohan takes us too close to Isengard !
gimli If we cannot go over the mountain , I say let us go under it !
saruman_ Moria .
saruman_ You fear to go into those mines .
saruman_ The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep .
saruman_ You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad- Dum .
saruman_ Shadow and flame .
gandalf Let the Ringbearer decide !
frodo We will go through the mines !
gandalf So be it .
gimli The walls of Moria .
gandalf Isildin .
gandalf It mirrors only starlight and moonlight .
gandalf It reads , The Gates of Durin , Lord of Moria .
gandalf Speak Friend and enter .
pippin What do you suppose it means ?
gandalf Simple .
gandalf If you are a friend , you speak the password , and the doors open .
aragorn The mines are no place for a pony , even one so brave as Bill .
aragorn Go on .
sam Bye bye , Bill .
aragorn Don't worry , Sam , he knows the way home .
aragorn Don't disturb the water !
gandalf This is useless !
frodo It's a riddle .
frodo What's the Elvish word for friend ?
gandalf Mellon .
gimli Soon , mister elf , you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves !
gimli Roaring fires , malt beer , red meat off the bone !
gimli This is the home of my cousin Balin .
gimli And they call it a mine .
gimli A mine !
boromir This is no mine , it's a tomb .
gimli No !
legolas Goblins !
boromir We make for the Gap of Rohan !
boromir We should never have come here !
boromir Get out !
boromir Get out !
sam Strider !
gandalf Into the mines !
gandalf Now we have but one choice .
gandalf We must face the long dark of Moria .
gandalf Be on your guard !
gandalf There are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world .
gandalf It is a four day journey to the other side .
gandalf Let us hope our presence may go unnoticed .
merry Pippin !
gandalf I have no memory of this place .
pippin Are we lost ?
merry No , we're not lost .
pippin I think we're lost .
merry Quiet , Gandalf's thinking .
pippin Merry ?
pippin I'm hungry .
frodo There's something down there .
gandalf It's Gollum .
gandalf He's been following us for three days .
frodo He escaped from the dungeons of Barad-dur !
gandalf Escaped , or was set loose .
gandalf Gollum hates and loves the ring , as he hates and loves himself .
gandalf He will never be free of his need for it .
frodo Pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance .
gandalf Pity ?
gandalf It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand .
gandalf Many who live deserve death , and some who die deserve life .
gandalf Can you give it to them ?
gandalf Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment .
gandalf Even the very wise cannot see all ends , but my heart tells me that Gollum still has a part to play , for good or ill .
gandalf Before this is over , the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many .
frodo I wish the ring had never come to me .
frodo I wish none of this had ever happened .
gandalf So do all who live to see such times , but that is not for them to decide .
gandalf All we have to decide is what to do with the time we are given .
gandalf There are other forces at work in the world than the will of evil .
gandalf Bilbo was meant to find the ring , which means that you also were meant to have it .
gandalf And that is an encouraging thought .
gandalf Ah !
gandalf It's this way .
merry He's remembered !
gandalf No , but the air smells less foul down here .
gandalf When in doubt , Meriadoc , always follow your nose .
gandalf Let me risk a little more light .
gandalf Behold !
gandalf The great realm of the dwarven city of Dwarrowdelf .
sam Well , that's an eye-opener and no mistake !
gandalf Gimli !
gandalf Here lies Balin , son of Hrundin , Lord of Moria .
gandalf He is dead then .
gandalf It is as I feared .
legolas We must move on .
legolas We cannot linger here .
gandalf They have taken the bridge , and the second hall .
gandalf We have barred the gates , but cannot hold them for long .
gandalf Drums , drums in the deep .
gandalf We cannot get out .
gandalf We cannot get out .
gandalf They are coming .
gandalf Fool of a Took !
gandalf Next time , throw yourself in , and rid us of your stupidity !
legolas Orcs !
boromir They have a cave troll .
aragorn Stay back , close to Gandalf !
gimli Let them come !
gimli There is one dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath !
sam I think I'm getting the hang of this !
frodo Aragorn !
frodo Help !
aragorn Oh , no .
sam He's alive !
frodo I'm all right , I'm not hurt .
aragorn You should be dead !
aragorn That spear would have skewered a wild boar !
gandalf I think there is more to this hobbit than meets the eye .
gimli Mithril !
gimli You are full of surprises , Mr . Baggins !
gandalf To the bridge of Khazad-Dum !
boromir What is this new devilry ?
gandalf A balrog .
gandalf A demon of the ancient world .
gandalf This foe is beyond any of you .
gandalf Run !
gandalf Lead them on , Aragorn !
gandalf The bridge is near .
gandalf Do as I say !
gandalf Swords are no more use here !
gimli Nobody tosses a dwarf !
gimli Not the beard !
aragorn Lean forward !
gandalf makes sure everyone is across the bridge before he makes his stand .
gandalf In the center of the bridge , he turns to face the demon , staff and sword in hand .
gandalf You cannot pass .
frodo Gandalf !
gandalf I am a servant of the secret fire , wielder of the flame of Anor !
gandalf Dark fire shall not avail you , flame of Udun !
gandalf Go back to the shadow !
gandalf You shall not pass !
gandalf Fly , you fools !
frodo No !
boromir Aragorn !
aragorn Legolas , get them up !
boromir Give them a moment , for pity's sake !
aragorn By nightfall these hills will be crawling with orcs !
aragorn We must reach the woods of Lothlorien .
aragorn Gimli , Legolas , get them up !
aragorn On your feet , Sam . Frodo ?
gimli Stay close , young hobbits .
gimli They say a great sorceress lives here , an elf-witch of terrible power .
gimli All those who look upon her fall under her spell , and are never seen again .
galadriel Frodo .
galadriel Your coming is as the footsteps of doom .
galadriel You bring a great evil here , Ringbearer .
gimli Well , this is one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily !
gimli I have the eyes of a hawk , and the ears of a fox !
haldir The dwarf breathes so loudly we could have shot him in the dark .
aragorn Haldir of Lorien .
aragorn We have come for help .
aragorn We need your protection .
gimli Aragorn , these woods are perilous !
gimli We should go back !
haldir You have entered the realm of the Lady of the Wood .
haldir You cannot go back .
haldir Come .
haldir She is waiting .
celeborn Eight there are here , but nine there were set out from Rivendell .
celeborn Where is Gandalf , for I much desire to speak with him .
galadriel He is fallen into shadow .
galadriel The quest stands on the edge of a knife , stray but a little
galadriel and it will fail , to the ruin of all .
galadriel Yet hope remains as long as the company is true .
galadriel Do not let your hearts be troubled .
galadriel Go now , and rest , for you are weary with toil and much sorrow .
galadriel Tonight you shall sleep in peace .
galadriel Welcome , Frodo of the Shire , one who has seen the Eye .
legolas A lament for Gandalf .
legolas I have not the heart to tell you .
legolas For me the grief is still too near .
aragorn Take some rest , Boromir .
aragorn These borders are well protected .
boromir I shall find no rest here .
boromir I heard a voice inside my head .
boromir She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor .
boromir She said to me , even now , there is hope left , but I cannot see it .
boromir It is long since we had any hope .
boromir My father is a noble man , but Izual is failing , and the people lose faith .
boromir My father looks to me to set it right , and I would do it
boromir , I would see the glory of Gondor restored .
boromir Have you seen it , Aragorn ?
boromir The white tower of Ecthelion glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver , its banners caught high in the morning breeze .
boromir Have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets ?
aragorn I have seen the White City , long ago .
boromir One day , our paths will lead us there , and the tower guard will take up the call , 'the lords of Gondor have returned!'
frodo wakes .
frodo He follows her to a basin set in stone , which she fills with water from a silver urn .
galadriel Will you look into the mirror ?
frodo What will I see ?
galadriel Not even the wisest can say , for the mirror shows many things .
galadriel Things that are , things that were , and some things that have not yet come to pass .
galadriel I know what it is you have seen , for it is also in my mind .
galadriel It is what will come to pass if you should fail .
galadriel The Fellowship is breaking .
galadriel Already it has begun .
galadriel He will try to take the ring .
galadriel You know of whom I speak .
galadriel One by one , it will destroy them all .
frodo If you ask it of me , I will give you the One Ring .
galadriel You offer it to me freely .
galadriel I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this .
galadriel Instead of a Dark Lord , you would have a queen , not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn !
galadriel Tempestuous as the sea , and stronger than the foundations of the earth !
galadriel All shall love me and despair !
galadriel I passed the test .
galadriel I will diminish , and go into the west , and remain Galadriel .
frodo I cannot do this alone .
galadriel You are a Ringbearer , Frodo .
galadriel To bear a ring of power is to be alone .
galadriel This task was appointed to you , and if you do not find a way , no one will .
frodo Then , I know what I must do .
frodo It's just I am afraid to do it .
galadriel Even the smallest person can change the course of the future .
saruman_ Do you know how orcs first came into being ?
saruman_ They were elves once , taken by the dark powers , tortured , mutilated .
saruman_ A ruined and terrible fall of life .
saruman_ And now perfected , my fighting Uruk- Hai .
saruman_ Whom do you serve ?
saruman_ Hunt them down .
saruman_ Do not stop until you have found them .
saruman_ You do not know pain , you do not know fear , you will taste man-flesh !
saruman_ One of the halflings carries something of great value .
saruman_ Bring them to me alive , and unspoiled !
saruman_ Kill the others .
galadriel Farewell , Frodo Baggins .
galadriel I give you the light of Earendil , our most beloved star .
galadriel Numarii .
galadriel May it be a light for you in dark places , where all other lights go out .
aragorn Frodo .
aragorn The Aragornath .
aragorn Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old , my kin .
aragorn We cross at nightfall , hide the boats and continue on foot .
aragorn We approach Mordor from the north .
gimli Oh ?
gimli Just a simple matter of finding our way across Emyn Muil , an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks !
gimli And then it gets even better !
gimli Festering , stinking marshlands as far as the eye can see !
aragorn That is our road , sir dwarf .
aragorn Perhaps you should take some rest , and recover your strength .
gimli Recover my ... !
legolas We should leave now .
aragorn No .
aragorn Orcs patrol the eastern shore .
aragorn We must wait for the cover of darkness .
legolas It is not the eastern shore that worries me .
legolas A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind .
legolas Something draws near , I can feel it .
gimli Recover my strength !
gimli Pay no heed to that , young hobbits .
merry Where is Frodo ?
boromir None of us should wander alone , you least of all .
boromir So much depends on you .
boromir Frodo ?
boromir I know why you seek solitude .
boromir You suffer
boromir , I see it day by day .
boromir Be sure you do not suffer needlessly .
boromir There are other ways , Frodo , other paths we might take .
frodo I know what you would say , and it would sound like wisdom , but for the warning in my heart .
boromir Warning ?
boromir Against what ?
boromir They are all afraid , but to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have ...
boromir Don't you see ?
boromir It's madness .
frodo There is no other way .
boromir Why do you recoil ?
boromir I am no thief .
frodo You are not yourself !
boromir I ask only for the strength to defend my people !
boromir If you would but lend me the ring .
frodo No !
boromir What chance do you think you have ?
boromir They will find you , they will take the ring , and you will beg for death before the end !
boromir It is not yours save by a happenstance .
boromir It could have been mine .
boromir It should have been mine !
boromir Give it to me !
frodo No !
boromir I see your mind !
boromir You would take the ring to Sauron !
boromir You will betray us !
boromir You go to your death , and the death of us all !
boromir Curse you !
boromir Curse all you halflings !
boromir Frodo ?
boromir Frodo ?
boromir What have I done ?
boromir Frodo , I'm sorry !
aragorn Frodo ?
frodo It has taken Boromir .
aragorn Where is the ring ?
frodo Stay away !
aragorn Frodo ?
aragorn I swore to protect you .
frodo Can you protect me from yourself ?
frodo Would you destroy it ?
aragorn I would have gone with you to the end , into the very fires of Mordor .
frodo I know .
frodo Take care of the others .
frodo Especially Sam , he will not understand .
aragorn Go , Frodo !
aragorn Run !
aragorn Run !
urukhai Find the Halflings !
urukhai Find the Halflings !
pippin Here , Frodo , hide here !
pippin What's he doing ?
merry He's leaving .
pippin No , Frodo !
merry Run , Frodo .
merry Go .
merry Hey , you , over here , this way !
pippin It's working !
merry I know it's working , run !
boromir They took the little ones .
aragorn Stay still .
boromir Frodo .
boromir Where is Frodo ?
aragorn I let Frodo go .
boromir Then you did what I could not .
boromir I tried to take the ring from him .
aragorn The ring is beyond our reach now .
boromir Forgive me .
boromir I did not see it .
boromir I have failed you all .
aragorn No , Boromir .
aragorn You fought bravely .
aragorn You have kept your honor .
boromir Leave it .
boromir It's over .
boromir The world of men will fail .
boromir All will fall into darkness , and my city to ruin .
aragorn I know not what strength lies in my blood , but I swear to you I will not let the White City fall , nor our people fail .
boromir Our people .
boromir Our people .
boromir I would have followed you , my brother , my captain , my king .
aragorn Be at peace , son of Gondor .
sam Frodo !
sam Mr .
sam Frodo !
frodo I wish the ring had never come to me .
frodo I wish none of this had ever happened .
gandalf So do all who live to see such times , but that is not for them to decide .
gandalf All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given you .
sam Frodo !
sam Mr .
sam Frodo !
frodo No , Sam .
frodo Go back , Sam .
frodo I'm going to Mordor alone !
sam Of course you are , and I'm coming with you !
frodo You can't swim !
frodo Sam !
sam I made a promise , Mr . Frodo .
sam A promise .
sam Don't you leave him , Samwise Gamgee , and I don't mean to .
sam I don't mean to .
frodo Oh , Sam .
frodo Come on .
legolas Hurry !
legolas Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore !
legolas You mean not to follow them .
aragorn Frodo's fate no longer rests in our hands .
gimli Then it was all in vain .
gimli The Fellowship has failed .
aragorn Not as long as we remain true to each other .
aragorn We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death .
aragorn Not while we have strength left .
aragorn Leave all that can be spared behind , we travel light .
aragorn Let us hunt some orc .
frodo Mordor .
frodo I hope the others find a safer road .
sam Strider will take care of them .
frodo I don't suppose we'll ever see them again .
sam We may yet , Mr . Frodo .
sam We may .
frodo Sam , I'm glad you're with me .

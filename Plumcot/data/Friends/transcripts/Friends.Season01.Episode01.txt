monica_geller There's nothing to tell !
monica_geller He's just some guy I work with !
joey_tribbiani C'mon , you're going out with the guy !
joey_tribbiani There's gotta be something wrong with him !
chandler_bing All right Joey , be nice .
chandler_bing So does he have a hump ?
chandler_bing A hump and a hairpiece ?
phoebe_buffay Wait , does he eat chalk ?
phoebe_buffay Just , 'cause , I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl-
phoebe_buffay oh !
monica_geller Okay , everybody relax .
monica_geller This is not even a date .
monica_geller It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex .
chandler_bing Sounds like a date to me .
chandler_bing Alright , so I'm back in high school , I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria , and I realize I am totally naked .
all Oh , yeah .
all Had that dream .
chandler_bing Then I look down , and I realize there's a phone ... there .
joey_tribbiani Instead of ... ?
chandler_bing That's right .
joey_tribbiani Never had that dream .
phoebe_buffay No .
chandler_bing All of a sudden , the phone starts to ring .
chandler_bing Now I don't know what to do , everybody starts looking at me .
monica_geller And they weren't looking at you before? !
chandler_bing Finally , I figure I'd better answer it , and it turns out it's my mother ,
chandler_bing which is very-very weird , because-
chandler_bing she never calls me !
dr_ross_geller Hi .
joey_tribbiani This guy says hello , I wanna kill myself .
monica_geller Are you okay , sweetie ?
dr_ross_geller I just feel like someone reached down my throat , grabbed my small intestine , pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck ...
chandler_bing Cookie ?
monica_geller Carol moved her stuff out today .
joey_tribbiani Ohh .
monica_geller Let me get you some coffee .
dr_ross_geller Thanks .
phoebe_buffay Ooh !
phoebe_buffay Oh !
dr_ross_geller No , no
dr_ross_geller don't !
dr_ross_geller Stop cleansing my aura !
dr_ross_geller No , just leave my aura alone , okay ?
phoebe_buffay Fine !
phoebe_buffay Be murky !
dr_ross_geller I'll be fine , alright ?
dr_ross_geller Really , everyone .
dr_ross_geller I hope she'll be very happy .
monica_geller No you don't .
dr_ross_geller No
dr_ross_geller I don't , to hell with her , she left me !
joey_tribbiani And you never knew she was a lesbian ...
dr_ross_geller No! !
dr_ross_geller Okay? !
dr_ross_geller Why does everyone keep fixating on that ?
dr_ross_geller She didn't know , how should I know ?
chandler_bing Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian ...
chandler_bing Did I say that out loud ?
dr_ross_geller I told mom and dad last night , they seemed to take it pretty well .
monica_geller Oh really , so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M. , " I'll never have grandchildren , I'll never have grandchildren .
monica_geller " was what ?
monica_geller A wrong number ?
dr_ross_geller Sorry .
joey_tribbiani Alright Ross , look .
joey_tribbiani You're feeling a lot of pain right now .
joey_tribbiani You're angry .
joey_tribbiani You're hurting .
joey_tribbiani Can I tell you what the answer is ?
joey_tribbiani Strip joint !
joey_tribbiani C'mon , you're single !
joey_tribbiani Have some hormones !
dr_ross_geller I don't want to be single , okay ?
dr_ross_geller I just ...
dr_ross_geller I
dr_ross_geller just-
dr_ross_geller I just wanna be married again !
chandler_bing And I just want a million dollars !
monica_geller Rachel? !
rachel_green Oh God Monica hi !
rachel_green Thank God !
rachel_green I just went to your building and you weren't there
rachel_green and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here
rachel_green and you are , you are !
waitress#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode01 Can I get you some coffee ?
monica_geller De-caff .
monica_geller Okay , everybody , this is Rachel , another Lincoln High survivor .
monica_geller This is everybody , this is Chandler , and Phoebe , and Joey , and-
monica_geller you remember my brother Ross ?
rachel_green Hi , sure !
dr_ross_geller Hi .
monica_geller So you wanna tell us now , or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids ?
rachel_green Oh God ... well , it started about a half hour before the wedding .
rachel_green I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents , and I was looking at this gravy boat .
rachel_green This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat .
rachel_green When all of a sudden-
rachel_green Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry !
rachel_green And then I got really freaked out , and that's when it hit me : how much Barry looks like Mr . Potato Head .
rachel_green Y'know , I mean , I always knew looked familiar , but ...
rachel_green Anyway , I just had to get out of there , and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this , and who am I doing this for?' .
rachel_green So anyway I just didn't know where to go , and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart , but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city .
monica_geller Who wasn't invited to the wedding .
monica_geller Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ , and she's really not happy about it .
chandler_bing Tuna or egg salad ?
chandler_bing Decide !
dr_ross_geller I'll have whatever Christine is having .
rachel_green Daddy , I just ...
rachel_green I can't marry him !
rachel_green I'm sorry .
rachel_green I just don't love him .
rachel_green Well , it matters to me !
phoebe_buffay If I let go of my hair , my head will fall off .

monica_geller The whole , 'hat' thing .
joey_tribbiani And hey , you need anything , you can always come to Joey .

monica_geller Joey , stop hitting on her !

monica_geller Shut up , Joey !
dr_ross_geller So Rachel , what're you , uh ...

phoebe_buffay Love is sweet as summer showers , love is a wondrous work of art , but
phoebe_buffay your love oh your love , your love ...is like a giant pigeon ...crapping on my heart .
phoebe_buffay La-la-la-la-la-
phoebe_buffay Thank you .
phoebe_buffay La-la-la-la ...ohhh !
dr_ross_geller I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things , using a bunch of these little worm guys .
dr_ross_geller I have no brackety thing
dr_ross_geller , I see no whim guys whatsoever
dr_ross_geller and-
dr_ross_geller I cannot feel my legs .
joey_tribbiani I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here .
chandler_bing It's a beautiful thing .
joey_tribbiani What's this ?
chandler_bing I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket .
joey_tribbiani Which goes where ?
chandler_bing I have no idea .
joey_tribbiani Done with the bookcase !
chandler_bing All finished !
dr_ross_geller This was Carol's favorite beer .
dr_ross_geller She always drank it out of the can , I should have known .
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey-hey-hey , if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here .
chandler_bing Yes , please don't spoil all this fun .
joey_tribbiani Ross , let me ask you a question .
joey_tribbiani She got the furniture , the stereo , the good TV-
joey_tribbiani what did you get ?
dr_ross_geller You guys .
chandler_bing Oh , God .
joey_tribbiani You got screwed .
chandler_bing Oh my God !
monica_geller Oh my God !
paul I know , I know , I'm such an idiot .
paul I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week .
paul I mean , how clean can teeth get ?
monica_geller My brother's going through that right now
monica_geller , he's such a mess .
monica_geller How did you get through it ?
paul Well , you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers , say her-
monica_geller -leg ?
paul That's one way !
paul Me , I-
paul I went for the watch .
monica_geller You actually broke her watch ?
monica_geller Wow !
monica_geller The worst thing I ever did was , I
monica_geller -I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel .
paul Ooh , steer clear of you .
rachel_green Barry , I'm sorry ...
rachel_green I am so sorry ...
rachel_green I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on , but it isn't ...
rachel_green it isn't , it's about me , and I ju-
rachel_green Hi , machine cut me off again ... anyway ...
rachel_green look , look , I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs .
rachel_green Barry Finkel , but
rachel_green it isn't me , it's not me .
rachel_green And not that I have any idea who me is right now , but you just have to give me a chance too ...
dr_ross_geller I'm divorced !
dr_ross_geller I'm only 26
dr_ross_geller and I'm divorced !
joey_tribbiani Shut up !
chandler_bing You must stop !
dr_ross_geller That only took me an hour .
chandler_bing Look , Ross , you gotta understand , between us
chandler_bing we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento .
chandler_bing You , however have had the love of a woman for four years .
chandler_bing Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out , and that is why we don't do it !
chandler_bing I don't think that was my point !
dr_ross_geller You know what the scariest part is ?
dr_ross_geller What if there's only one woman for everybody , y'know ?
dr_ross_geller I mean what if you get
dr_ross_geller one woman- and that's it ?
dr_ross_geller Unfortunately in my case , there was only one woman- for her ...
joey_tribbiani What are you talking about ? '
joey_tribbiani One woman' ?
joey_tribbiani That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you .
joey_tribbiani Lemme tell you something , Ross .
joey_tribbiani There's lots of flavors out there .
joey_tribbiani There's Rocky Road , and Cookie Dough , and Bing !
joey_tribbiani Cherry Vanilla .
joey_tribbiani You could get 'em with Jimmies , or nuts , or whipped cream !
joey_tribbiani This is the best thing that ever happened to you !
joey_tribbiani You got married , you were , like , what , eight ?
joey_tribbiani Welcome back to the world !
joey_tribbiani Grab a spoon !
dr_ross_geller I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny .
paul Ever since she walked out on me , I , uh ...
monica_geller What?
monica_geller .... .
monica_geller What , you wanna spell it out with noodles ?
paul No , it's ,
paul it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation .
monica_geller Oh , so there is gonna be a fifth date ?
paul Isn't there ?
monica_geller Yeah ...
monica_geller yeah
monica_geller , I think there is .
monica_geller -What were you gonna say ?

paul Sexually .
monica_geller Oh God , oh God , I am sorry ...
monica_geller I am so sorry ...
paul It's okay ...
monica_geller I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now .
monica_geller Um ... how long ?
paul Two years .
monica_geller Wow !
monica_geller I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch !
paul So you still think you , um ... might want that fifth date ?

joey_tribbiani Of course it was a line !
monica_geller Why? !
monica_geller Why ?
monica_geller Why , why would anybody do something like that ?
dr_ross_geller I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed' .
monica_geller I hate men !
monica_geller I hate men !
phoebe_buffay Oh no , don't hate , you don't want to put that out into the universe .
monica_geller Is it me ?

dr_ross_geller You got a job ?
rachel_green Are you kidding ?
rachel_green I'm trained for nothing !
rachel_green I was laughed out of twelve interviews today .
chandler_bing And yet you're surprisingly upbeat .
rachel_green You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale , fifty percent off !
chandler_bing Oh , how well you know me ...
rachel_green They're my new 'I don't need a job
rachel_green , I don't need my parents , I've got great boots' boots !

rachel_green Um ...
rachel_green my ... father .
rachel_green Oh God , come on you guys , is this really necessary ?
rachel_green I mean , I can stop charging anytime I want .
monica_geller C'mon , you can't live off your parents your whole life .
rachel_green I know that .
rachel_green That's why I was getting married .
phoebe_buffay Give her a break , it's hard being on your own for the first time .
rachel_green Thank you .
phoebe_buffay You're welcome .
phoebe_buffay I remember when I first came to this city .
phoebe_buffay I was fourteen .
phoebe_buffay My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison , and I got here ,
phoebe_buffay and I didn't know anybody .
phoebe_buffay And I ended up living with this albino guy who was , like , cleaning windshields outside port authority , and then he killed himself , and then I found aromatherapy .
phoebe_buffay So believe me , I know exactly how you feel .
dr_ross_geller The word you're looking for is 'Anyway' ...
monica_geller All right , you ready ?
rachel_green No .
rachel_green No , no , I'm not ready !
rachel_green How can I be ready ? "
rachel_green Hey , Rach !
rachel_green You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute? "
rachel_green Come on , I can't do this !
monica_geller You can
monica_geller , I know you can !
rachel_green I don't think so .
dr_ross_geller Come on , you made coffee !
dr_ross_geller You can do anything !
dr_ross_geller C'mon , cut .
dr_ross_geller Cut , cut , cut, ...
all Cut , cut , cut , cut , cut , cut , cut ...
rachel_green Y'know
rachel_green what ?
rachel_green I think we can just leave it at that .
rachel_green It's kinda like a symbolic gesture ...
monica_geller Rachel !
monica_geller That was a library card !
all Cut , cut , cut , cut , cut , cut , cut.
all .
chandler_bing Y'know , if you listen closely , you can hear a thousand retailers scream .
monica_geller Welcome to the real world !
monica_geller It sucks .
monica_geller You're gonna love it !
monica_geller Well , that's it
monica_geller You gonna crash on the couch ?

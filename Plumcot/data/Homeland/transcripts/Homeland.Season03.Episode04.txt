not_available Pan Am Flight 103 crashed into the town of Lockerbie.
not_available He has sanctioned acts of terror in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
not_available This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.
not_available his relentless pursuit of terror.
not_available We will make no distinction
not_available The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden.
not_available This was an act of terrorism.
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act.
not_available The next number we're gonna swing for you is one of the good ol' favorites.
not_available until something stops him.
not_available It was right in front of my eyes, and I never saw it coming.
not_available We got a plane crashed into the World Trade Center.
not_available thousands of people running
not_available We must, and we will, remain vigilant at home and abroad.
not_available You're the smartest and the dumbest fucking person I've ever known.
not_available I'm not the one who got it wrong.
not_available I'm the only one who got it right.
not_available Take 'em.
not_available Take 'em all.
not_available Roll every available ambulance you've got to this position.
not_available Previously on Homeland.
not_available Where am I? Caracas.
not_available Your new home.
not_available Perhaps you'd care to comment on the article in yesterday's paper.
not_available The case officer in question, she's been diagnosed as bipolar.
not_available Carrie, she called a reporter.
not_available Apparently, she thinks it's important they "hear her side of the story." I just wanted you to know I'm gonna stop her.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Get off of me! This is a fucking sham! Dana has made great progress over the last month.
not_available She's doing well.
not_available You mean, for someone who tried to slit her wrists? Your sister's gone.
not_available I just really needed to see you.
not_available He's not good for you.
not_available And that is based on what? Not knowing him at all? 
not_available He's unstable.
not_available You know what you're here for? 
not_available To examine the bank records.
not_available You're following the money.
not_available To this guy, here.
not_available Majid Javadi.
not_available The Iranian who funded the attack on this agency that occurred on 12/12.
not_available I was wondering if you could tell Saul Berenson how much better I'm doing.
not_available We both know I'm not here because I'm crazy.
not_available I'm here because they don't know where else to put me.
not_available I'm an associate at Bennett, Parr and Hamilton.
not_available One of our partners would like to meet with you.
not_available I'm talking about getting you out of here.
not_available I know what you're doing.
not_available What do you mean? You think I'm vulnerable? 
not_available Not at all.
not_available No, worse than that, you think I'm weak.
not_available Maybe, with the right incentive, I'll turn against the people who did this to me.
not_available So whoever it is you're working for, the Syrians, the Israelis, the Iranians you tell them I would rather die in here.
not_available Help! No, please! No! Let me go! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! No! 
not_available Hold still! No.
not_available No! No! Please! Get her on the bed! 
not_available No! No, please.
not_available No! 
not_available Take her.
not_available Hold her up! No, let me go! No! 
not_available Hold still.
not_available Come on! No! No! No! No! No! No, no! 
not_available Hold still.
not_available Don't let go.
not_available Hold still.
not_available No! Leave me alone! Hold her! No! Let me go! Let me go! No! No! No! Everything in here okay? 
not_available I'm not gonna repeat myself.
not_available Everything's okay.
not_available This door stays open.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Good morning.
not_available I did what you said.
not_available I followed the money.
not_available The missing five percent.
not_available Right.
not_available Turns out it's skimmed off the top once the funds arrive in Caracas at the HLBC subsidiary there.
not_available Which happens when? The third Friday of each month.
not_available Tell me how it works.
not_available First, it's converted into small bills stacked on pallets, loaded into a truck and delivered in the night to the Studio Capital where it's held at the box office until the next day and declared as receipts for the weekly football match.
not_available I bet you didn't know that Del Paraíso FC draws more fans on those Saturdays than they have seats in their stadium.
not_available That's a hell of a way to claim money.
not_available And lots of it.
not_available By our estimates, over 45 million dollars during the last 10 years.
not_available So somebody's got a sidebar with the bank.
not_available Who? The owner of the team? Probably.
not_available Except It's hard to know who that is.
not_available The club is structured so as to shield the identity of its majority shareholder.
not_available You have a candidate, don't you? I do.
not_available Just not one that makes sense.
not_available Nasser Hejazi.
not_available Say again.
not_available Nasser Hejazi.
not_available Do you know him? I know he played goalkeeper for Iran's 1978 World Cup Team.
not_available He's a legend there.
not_available It can't be that Nasser Hejazi.
not_available Why not? 
not_available Because he's dead.
not_available Who's dead? I heard you were in the building.
not_available I left the DOJ documents on your desk.
not_available Yeah, I saw.
not_available You still want me to handle that? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'll be up in a minute.
not_available I'll be waiting.
not_available Where were we? 
not_available Exactly nowhere.
not_available Unless What? Say I'm an Iranian official whose job it is to fund terrorist operations in the Western hemisphere.
not_available Okay.
not_available Say I'm watching all these bankers get rich on the deal.
not_available Why not me too? Because you'd be taking a huge risk, for one thing.
not_available Which is why I go to such great lengths to launder the proceeds all the while hiding behind a false identity.
not_available Like a goalkeeper.
not_available Right.
not_available Still.
not_available If the Revolutionary Guard ever finds out you've been embezzling all that money
not_available Maybe I'm getting to the end of my career.
not_available Maybe I'm looking to retire in style.
not_available Maybe I've always dreamed of owning a soccer team.
not_available Javadi? Why Javadi? Because it was his operation in the first place.
not_available Because it makes sense that he was the one to approach the Venezuelan bank.
not_available And because Nasser Hejazi was his boyhood hero.
not_available Don't smile yet.
not_available Right now, it's just a theory.
not_available Morning, Carrie, how are we today? 
not_available You have a brush? Yeah.
not_available You sleep okay? Yeah, fine.
not_available So, I did a final review of your doctors and therapists followed up with them last night.
not_available They all give you excellent reports.
not_available Do you have any blush? 
not_available You look fine.
not_available I look like a ghost.
not_available My dad and sister are coming, right? 
not_available They'll be here.
not_available I called to remind them yesterday.
not_available I should say I'm gonna live with them.
not_available I don't think that's necessary.
not_available The fact that they're helping you transition back into the community is enough.
not_available I don't wanna leave anything to chance.
not_available Trust me, we're not.
not_available Here.
not_available Let me.
not_available So, the medical staff is first up.
not_available They will present their reports, take some questions.
not_available Then it's the independent evaluator.
not_available His name is Walter Walker.
not_available A friend.
not_available Really nice guy.
not_available Then it's your turn.
not_available Then I go home? 
not_available Then you go home.
not_available Carrie, it's time.
not_available Okay.
not_available Don't forget to tell the board how grateful you are for all of their help in your recovery.
not_available Makes them feel they made a difference.
not_available Yeah, it always gets them.
not_available So, thank
not_available yous all around.
not_available Yeah, I can do that.
not_available Good morning, Abby.
not_available Where's my dad and sister? They should be here by now.
not_available I don't know.
not_available All rise.
not_available For the Sixth Circuit of the Commonwealth of Virginia Special Justice Robert Strauss.
not_available Please be seated.
not_available Matter of Carrie Mathison.
not_available Why don't we start with you, Dr.
not_available Maloney? I understand there's been an issue with the patient's medication? There was, Your Honor.
not_available It's been resolved.
not_available Explain.
not_available I titrated her lithium dose in daily increments of 600 mg until a daily dosage of 1800
not_available Carrie participates in group sessions and craft activities enthusiastically.
not_available She has demonstrated a talent in ceramics.
not_available She's been a pleasure to have on the ward, setting a good example
not_available And it is my opinion as an independent evaluator that the patient, Carrie Mathison, meets all the criteria for discharge today with the one proviso that she continue therapy as an outpatient.
not_available What do you say, Miss Mathison? Feel well enough to go home? 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available And where is home? 
not_available I live in Adams Morgan.
not_available Alone? Yes, but my dad and sister are a 15
not_available minute drive away and we see each other all the time.
not_available They were to make an appearance today, were they not? I talked with Carrie's father yesterday.
not_available They said they would be.
not_available If my dad says he's coming, he'll be here.
not_available He's probably stuck in traffic.
not_available Thank you, Miss Mathison.
not_available The members of this committee will now confer and come to a determination.
not_available Oh, and I wanna thank everybody here for helping me.
not_available I'm forever grateful.
not_available This shouldn't take too long.
not_available Go.
not_available Mr.
not_available Krasny.
not_available Wanna come with me? Ladies.
not_available Please sit.
not_available Miss Mathison, I'm afraid I can't approve your release from this facility today.
not_available What? Unfucking
not_available believable.
not_available I don't understand, Your Honor.
not_available I've just been handed a writ from the Justice Department.
not_available Saying what? That your client, in her current state of mind, poses a threat to national security.
not_available Her current state of mind is excellent.
not_available Four mental health professionals just testified to that.
not_available The government's worried she'll disclose classified information.
not_available Isn't that what got her into trouble in the first place, violating federal secrecy laws? That was over a month ago when she was off her meds.
not_available I'm inclined to agree with you, Counselor but Miss Mathison signed away some of her constitutional protections when she went to work for the CIA.
not_available Is that true? Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, among others.
not_available Do we have the right to appeal? Frankly, I don't know.
not_available What do you mean? This is a new one for me too, Counselor.
not_available Miss Mathison, I am sorry.
not_available But you've been designated a security risk.
not_available My hands are tied.
not_available Miss Mathison, I have to take you upstairs now.
not_available I need a few minutes with my client.
not_available I'm going straight from here to the circuit court to file an emergency appeal.
not_available You're wasting your time.
not_available You don't know that.
not_available Yeah, I do.
not_available Did you see the guy in the hallway before we went back in? No.
not_available Who was he? Dar Adal.
not_available He's the former head of a group inside the Agency nobody likes to talk about.
not_available If he wants to keep me in here, then I'm not getting out anytime soon.
not_available I need your phone.
not_available You know I can't do that.
not_available I just wanna call my dad.
not_available Make sure he and my sister are okay.
not_available Make it quick.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available God, I hate these things.
not_available Hello.
not_available Where were you guys? What do you mean? 
not_available You were supposed to be at my hearing.
not_available I thought it was canceled.
not_available Who told you that? Maggie spoke to somebody last night.
not_available Was it Saul? I don't know who it was.
not_available And I'm not at home right now.
not_available Look, Dad, I need you to do something for me.
not_available Saul's not talking to me.
not_available You have to.
not_available What do you want me to tell him? 
not_available Tell him I give up.
not_available I can't stand another second in this place.
not_available I'm going out of my mind.
not_available Carrie 
not_available I'll do whatever he wants, just not this.
not_available Carrie, please.
not_available I could lose my job.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Call Saul.
not_available Tell him what I said.
not_available Perfect timing.
not_available Your nails have gotten long.
not_available We'll have to trim them later.
not_available Backpack.
not_available Front pocket.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Jessica? My mom.
not_available What the hell is that? Hey.
not_available They can catch us with the GPS.
not_available They're gonna catch us anyway.
not_available Doesn't mean we make it easier for them.
not_available Come on, Dana.
not_available Pick up, pick up.
not_available Voice mail.
not_available Here, let me.
not_available Dana, it's me, Mike.
not_available Your mom and I are worried about you.
not_available Plus, she'd really like her car back.
not_available Give us a call so we know you're okay.
not_available A little worried? It's all I can do to keep from screaming at the phone.
not_available Nothing's gonna happen to her, Jess.
not_available Jessica, this is Martin and Lynn Carras, Leo's parents.
not_available Hello.
not_available This is a friend of mine, Mike Faber.
not_available Do we know anything yet? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available It's early.
not_available Any idea where they might be? A friend's house, favorite hangout? I've tried everybody.
not_available Nobody's heard from her.
not_available All I know is that she's in my car.
not_available It's an Outback.
not_available Blue.
not_available If you'd just report the car stolen, they could put out an APB on her right now.
not_available She didn't steal it.
not_available She said she was going to Trader Joe's.
not_available She was lying obviously.
not_available Look, Mrs.
not_available Carras.
not_available I wanna find them as much as you do.
not_available If there's anything I can do to help It's not an official missing person for 24 hours.
not_available The state police have a description and are aware that Leo's a fugitive from here.
not_available A fugitive? Most of the time in these situations, kids show up after a few hours.
not_available They're blowing off steam.
not_available It's hormones.
not_available Young love.
not_available We've all been there.
not_available It's not hormones.
not_available He's under a bad influence.
not_available Excuse me? 
not_available We know who you are, Mrs.
not_available Brody.
not_available Then you should know my daughter is not responsible for what her father did.
not_available Your car for the Camry? 
not_available Yeah, maybe you throw in a little extra.
not_available I just put a whole new transmission in that Camry.
not_available It'll go another 100,000, no problem.
not_available That Outback, what, maybe another The Outback's worth more in parts than a dozen transmissions in that Camry.
not_available This car of yours hot? Yeah, we just carjacked it.
not_available Natural born killers.
not_available Do I know you from someplace? I don't think so.
not_available What do you say, Aurelio? Is there a problem here? You wanna trade? It's car for car.
not_available None of this 200 dollar extra bullshit.
not_available We can just go down the street.
not_available I know you.
not_available Deal.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Carrie, you just gonna lie there or you gonna get packed? What? You're out.
not_available Carrie, you're out.
not_available I'm out? By emergency order of the Sixth Circuit Court of Maryland.
not_available I can go? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available How the hell did that happen? Who cares? Start packing.
not_available Go.
not_available Don't be alarmed.
not_available I apologize for the intrusion.
not_available You.
not_available I should've known.
not_available Get the fuck out of my house.
not_available Hear me out.
not_available I told you before.
not_available No.
not_available We went to a lot of trouble to get you out of that hospital.
not_available You can give me two minutes.
not_available If I had known, I would've stayed in the hospital.
not_available I doubt that, but the furlough's only good for 24 hours anyway, so How'd you arrange my release? A judge we know.
not_available Who, by the way, is more than willing to make it permanent.
not_available In exchange for? A sit down with one of the partners in the firm.
not_available That's all? Nothing's that easy.
not_available You're probably right.
not_available But that's above my pay grade.
not_available My job is to get you to the meeting.
not_available Do I have a choice? Why not at least listen to what the man has to say? What have you got to lose? When's this meeting supposed to happen? Tomorrow.
not_available 8:00 a.m.
not_available I can pick you up here.
not_available Okay then.
not_available Okay what? I'll sit down with him.
not_available Good.
not_available I'll see you in the morning.
not_available Hey, Helen.
not_available Have you seen my car? Your car? What do you mean? It's gone.
not_available Well that's strange.
not_available I haven't seen it in days.
not_available Which circuit court in Maryland? The sixth? Do they have jurisdiction over a county mental hospital in Arlington, Virginia? Okay, thanks.
not_available Carrie? 
not_available Yeah, I just heard.
not_available She's angry and vulnerable.
not_available Right now she could be saying anything to anybody.
not_available Do we know who petitioned the judge? 
not_available No.
not_available Maybe it was her family.
not_available Not according to her father, it wasn't.
not_available The Agency's still weak, Saul.
not_available It could die of the common cold.
not_available And she's a full
not_available blown contagion.
not_available Find her.
not_available Get her off the street.
not_available I'm afraid you can't access your funds on deposit at this time.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available Your account's been frozen.
not_available It's been what? 
not_available Frozen.
not_available It says here, "By order of the Department of Justice." You under federal indictment? 
not_available Not that I'm aware of.
not_available I'm also instructed to confiscate any credit cards you may have.
not_available Those you're not getting.
not_available They won't do you much good anyway.
not_available They've been canceled.
not_available I just need to get out of town for a few days.
not_available I can't help you there.
not_available Come on, you know I'm good for it.
not_available It's not about the money.
not_available What then? My livelihood.
not_available You are radioactive, Carrie.
not_available I shouldn't even be talking to you.
not_available I've got no one else to ask.
not_available You gotta make things right with Saul.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available He says that you went to the press.
not_available Oh, Jesus Christ, Carrie.
not_available What are you trying to do, get us all thrown in jail? I made a mistake.
not_available It won't happen again.
not_available I should fucking hope not.
not_available What about your van? Can I at least borrow your van? 
not_available No.
not_available Just for the weekend.
not_available To go up to the lake.
not_available Carrie, I can't.
not_available Virgil, please.
not_available I'm in trouble.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available Great.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I need it back first thing Monday morning.
not_available Absolutely.
not_available You got it.
not_available When can I come by? I'm gonna be in and out all day.
not_available I'll leave the keys.
not_available Say hi to your mom for me.
not_available My mom? What are you talking about? Virgil? "In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree where Alph, the sacred river, ran through caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea." And then it goes on.
not_available It's kind of beautiful, huh? Yeah, he would've liked it.
not_available You think so? He would've liked you.
not_available He was one year younger? 
not_available Eleven months.
not_available Irish twins.
not_available Still.
not_available I guess it was my job.
not_available What was? To protect him.
not_available Isn't that what older brothers are supposed to do? He killed himself.
not_available With a gun.
not_available It's hard to blame anyone but him.
not_available Believe me, I should know.
not_available Leave it to my daughter to fall in love on the psych ward.
not_available I know some guys on the Arlington PD.
not_available I'll make some calls.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You okay? I just can't seem to do one thing right anymore.
not_available Hey.
not_available They were the ones who were rude.
not_available That's no excuse.
not_available Come on.
not_available You're way too nice.
not_available No.
not_available I just almost lost Dana, so I know how they must feel.
not_available I should've just let you move in here like you wanted to.
not_available Jess.
not_available You were always so good with her.
not_available So much better than me.
not_available I'm not her mother.
not_available It was Brody who broke her heart.
not_available I could kill him, Mike.
not_available I swear to God, I could.
not_available Can you guess? It's where your dad was stationed.
not_available And? And I don't know.
not_available Right there.
not_available Where those buses are there was a long line of them.
not_available I was over there.
not_available Other side of the parking lot with Chris and my mom and all the other families.
not_available Chris was so freaked out.
not_available He wouldn't let go of my hand.
not_available You know, everybody was hugging and crying all around us.
not_available The day your dad deployed for Iraq.
not_available There was a Marine band playing and when my dad walked out with all the other guys from his battalion you could tell that he was excited.
not_available He wanted to go.
not_available He was some kind of sniper or something, right? Yeah.
not_available How old were you? Eight.
not_available Fuck.
not_available But that's not why we're here.
not_available We're here because this is where it happened.
not_available The last true thing that he ever said to me.
not_available Which was? Good
not_available bye.
not_available Everything after that was a lie.
not_available Hello.
not_available Remember me? You're kind of hard to forget.
not_available Listen, I know this is awkward but I kind of need a place to stay.
not_available Probably I should've called first.
not_available Probably.
not_available But it's just for the night.
not_available Well, I've got exactly one couch and one bed.
not_available Bed's cool with me.
not_available Come on in.
not_available So it is him.
not_available Javadi.
not_available That's him, third from the right.
not_available Jesus, he's gotten old.
not_available Standing next to him is Edgar Cedeño.
not_available The banker we targeted in last month's mission.
not_available When was this photograph taken? 
not_available 2009.
not_available According to passenger manifests, Javadi visited Venezuela exactly twice.
not_available Once at the time of this photograph and once in November 2003.
not_available To set up the deal with Cedeño's bank.
not_available Each time traveling under the name Nasser Hejazi.
not_available His alter ego.
not_available He couldn't resist the joke.
not_available Now it's gonna bury him.
not_available With your blessing, I'd like to open an OFAC investigation into his majority ownership position in the Del Paraíso Football Club.
not_available No.
not_available Why not? Now's the time for patience.
not_available Don't force the pieces.
not_available Store them away.
not_available But we have him.
not_available He's embezzled over $45 million from the Revolutionary Guard.
not_available They get wind of it, they'll just shoot him.
not_available Good.
not_available No.
not_available It's of negative value.
not_available He's secondin
not_available command at the Intelligence Directorate, Fara.
not_available He ordered the attack on this building.
not_available I need him in a room.
not_available You wanna interrogate him.
not_available I wanna rip him down to the studs.
not_available I want the name of every agent he's ever run in the United States.
not_available And I wanna know just how close the regime is to a nuclear weapon.
not_available Miss Mathison.
not_available Leland Bennett.
not_available What is this place? The firm keeps it for our more privacy
not_available sensitive clients.
not_available It's a pleasure to meet you.
not_available I tried to tell your colleague, Mr.
not_available Franklin.
not_available Mr.
not_available Franklin.
not_available You're wasting your time.
not_available How do you know that when you haven't heard our proposal? I'm not for sale.
not_available We're not trying to buy you.
not_available Really.
not_available No one's gonna ask you to do anything you're uncomfortable with.
not_available I'm already uncomfortable.
not_available It's up to you to draw the line you won't cross.
not_available For all I know, you're FBI and this is a sting.
not_available What's so funny? You have an active imagination.
not_available Somebody shut down my bank account and repossessed my car.
not_available Your own agency did that to you.
not_available That's my point.
not_available I'm not going to jail.
not_available It seems to me you're already there.
not_available There are no recording devices or cameras in this room if that's what you're worried about.
not_available Would you like to step outside? Okay, I'm listening.
not_available Our firm has long
not_available standing relationships with several countries in the Middle East.
not_available We lobby on their behalf, represent their interests here in Washington.
not_available Yeah, I know how this works.
not_available So, what does your client want? To pick your brain from time to time.
not_available Put you on retainer, as it were.
not_available Pick my brain? On what subject? Your area of expertise.
not_available For example? 
not_available For example he recently lost six business associates.
not_available Maybe you heard about it.
not_available So this is Iran we're talking about.
not_available He'd like to know how those men were identified and targeted.
not_available That line you mentioned? We just crossed it.
not_available Miss Mathison
not_available No.
not_available I won't do it.
not_available Iran was behind the Langley bombing.
not_available Which they carried out in retaliation for Israeli air strikes on their nuclear facilities.
not_available I reject the comparison.
not_available Why? It's one military target for another.
not_available Iran takes great care in its proportional response to acts of aggression.
not_available An airliner for an airliner.
not_available A Mossad agent for a physicist.
not_available Sounds like you've drunk the Kool
not_available Aid.
not_available I'm a professional.
not_available I'm paid to make arguments, not wave a flag.
not_available Good
not_available bye, Mr.
not_available Bennett.
not_available You'll be back in County lockup by the end of the day.
not_available Put there by the very institutions you're trying to protect.
not_available I'll take my chances.
not_available Well, you know how this works.
not_available You said so yourself.
not_available Meaning what? You familiar with the term "controversialize"? No.
not_available Well, that's what they're doing to you.
not_available They're turning you into the story.
not_available They started by leaking your relationship with Congressman Brody.
not_available Next it was Saul Berenson's testimony in front of the Senate Select Committee then they had you committed.
not_available Soon, it's not a story about a terrorist attack anymore or how the people meant to protect us screwed up.
not_available It's about you.
not_available It's about sex between a bipolar CIA officer and her brainwashed boyfriend.
not_available I'm not a traitor.
not_available No.
not_available What you are is a liability to a lot of people who've got a lot to lose.
not_available They've kept your name out of the press.
not_available How long do you think that's gonna last? And what happens then? I'll tell you what.
not_available You're destroyed.
not_available You're a pariah.
not_available And in six months or a year, if you haven't killed yourself by then they'll do it for you.
not_available You're naive to think they won't.
not_available You'll slip in the shower or they'll force
not_available feed you lithium till your heart stops or hang you on a doorknob and call it suicide.
not_available Let us help you, Carrie.
not_available We're very good at it.
not_available You can keep me out of the hospital? 
not_available I can.
not_available I'm broke.
not_available I don't have a dime to my name.
not_available You'll be compensated handsomely.
not_available Well, then, I never want to see you again, Mr.
not_available Bennett.
not_available I will see your client.
not_available But only him.
not_available And only faceto
not_available face.
not_available Well, that could be a problem.
not_available His problem.
not_available And tell him I won't name names either.
not_available I won't betray my people in the field.
not_available That's between you and him.
not_available No.
not_available That is non
not_available negotiable.
not_available Okay.
not_available Think of it this 
way Maybe you two can find some common ground.
not_available Put the world right.
not_available Save us all.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Did you say something? Yeah.
not_available Fuck you.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bennett wanted you to have this as a show of good faith.
not_available How would he feel about me buying a ticket to Southeast Asia and disappearing into the jungle for a while? You might consider a car trip to Atlantic City instead.
not_available Why's that? You're on the TSA no
not_available fly list and your passport's no longer valid.
not_available Good to know.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Have a nice walk.
not_available Have you heard anything? 
not_available No.
not_available What is it? 
not_available This.
not_available A detective buddy of mine got it for me.
not_available Leo wasn't in the rehab facility for treatment.
not_available His parents made a deal with the DA so he wouldn't be charged with homicide.
not_available What? Details are sketchy, but he managed to get his hand on his father's gun.
not_available Maybe it was a suicide pact, maybe it wasn't.
not_available Either way, the brother ends up dead and this Leo walks.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey.
not_available What time is it? Who cares? I just want to stay like this forever.
not_available You know, usually I wake up and I feel so strange but today this is just perfect.
not_available I never wanna go back.
not_available Then we don't have to.
not_available Carrie.
not_available Saul.
not_available Give us a minute.
not_available What are you doing here? 
not_available I wasn't followed.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Yeah, I'm sure.
not_available I used every trick in the book.
not_available Took me over five hours to get here.
not_available I'm all right.
not_available It worked, Saul.
not_available They picked me up this morning.
not_available Who did? A man named Franklin.
not_available He took me to a house in Potomac where I met with Leland Bennett.
not_available The lawyer.
not_available Yes.
not_available What did he say? What did he say, Carrie? What were his exact words? He said his client recently lost six business associates and would like to know how those men were identified and targeted.
not_available Javadi.
not_available It has to be.
not_available Did you hold out for a meeting in person? I did it the way you said, told Bennett the meeting had to be faceto
not_available face.
not_available And he went for it? You are an amazing person, Carrie Mathison.
not_available Amazing.
not_available I don't know.
not_available You've been very, very brave.
not_available You should've gotten me out of the hospital.
not_available You shouldn't have left me in there.
not_available It's almost over.
not_available No.
not_available It's too hard.
not_available I can't keep going.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Mira will make you a nice cup of tea.
not_available Come.
not_available Here.

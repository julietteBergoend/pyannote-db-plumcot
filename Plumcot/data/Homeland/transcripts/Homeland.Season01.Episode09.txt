not_available So far , not a whole lot .
not_available Well , have you even asked him ?
not_available Yes , Dana , of course I've asked him .
not_available He can't believe it .
not_available He says there's got to be some mistake .
not_available It's not the first time the FBI have gotten it wrong .
not_available Yeah ,
not_available but what if they're right ?
not_available Two Marines are captured and one comes back a terrorist ?
not_available Dad must be going out of his mind .
not_available Did you find everything you're looking for today , sir ?

not_available You're welcome .
not_available Just one thing .
not_available Yeah .
not_available What does that say ?
not_available Vitamin Water .

not_available It's like flavored water .
not_available Would you like me to get someone to find it for you ?
not_available What flavor ?
not_available I don't know , what you got ?
not_available Um Hey , you're that Marine war hero guy , right ?
not_available We have nothing to do but pray for our brothers , that they were going to heaven for God .
not_available And the FBI said that they were fired at first .
not_available Which is a lie .
not_available The truth is , they shot and killed two innocent people in a house of worship .
not_available Without provocation .
not_available What about the man they were chasing Tom Walker ?
not_available What do you know about him ?
not_available All any of us know is that a stranger ran through our mosque being chased by FBI agents while we were gathering for morning prayers .
not_available Have you been told the names of the agents who fired the shots ?
not_available No , we're still awaiting a full investigation .
not_available We don't know anything yet .
not_available No , sir .
not_available We do not condone hate .
not_available Or violence .
not_available Ms .
not_available Mathison .
not_available Special Agent Hall .
not_available I asked to meet the SWAT team commander , the man who was on the ground for this .
not_available And you got me .
not_available His boss .
not_available How can I help ?
not_available Would you mind taking your shoes off , please ?
not_available What are we doing here , exactly ?
not_available Everything we can to catch Walker .
not_available You're aware there's an FBI manhunt up and running .
not_available All 56 field offices , canceled leave
not_available The reason why I asked to meet the actual SWAT commander is because I need him to walk me through exactly what happened here .
not_available Which he already did with me .
not_available So , Walker comes in from the alley , through this door here .
not_available And we already know he was armed , because he stole a gun from one of your men .
not_available And ?
not_available Did Walker open fire first ?
not_available Yes .
not_available Yet the imam is standing out there , telling the world that's a lie .
not_available The imam ?
not_available It's his word against mine .
not_available He also says that neither he nor any of his flock know Walker .
not_available Which is not true .
not_available Do you want to know why ?
not_available Please .
not_available Walk with me .
not_available He hauls ass down these stairs to a service corridor that goes left to a janitor's storage room , or right , doubling back underneath the building to a bilko door on Raum Street , all the way on the east side of the building .
not_available Son of a bitch goes right .
not_available He knew exactly where the fuck he was going .
not_available You following me on this so far ?
not_available He knows this mosque .
not_available Correct .
not_available And probably a lot of people that come here , too .
not_available Assalamo alliakum .
not_available Wa 'aliakumas salam .
not_available Imam , let me begin by saying how deeply sorry I am for your loss .
not_available Losses .
not_available Plural .
not_available There were two dead .
not_available Imam , my name is Carrie Mathison .
not_available Another government official here to suggest that if we weren't all guilty , one way or another , none of this would have happened .
not_available Right ?
not_available I'm also well aware of your good work in this neighborhood , beyond just here in the mosque .
not_available Then you should know how violated we all feel .
not_available I do .
not_available Yes .
not_available I have seven eyewitnesses , including myself , who saw what happened .
not_available Please forgive me , but my job right now , my only job , is to catch this man Walker as soon as possible .
not_available He did not fire a single shot at the agents .
not_available He was moving too fast , trying to get away from them .
not_available Either Walker was very lucky to get away as quickly as he did , or he knew this mosque well enough to use it as an escape route .
not_available I have families to comfort .
not_available I have funerals to arrange .
not_available I have a community who believes they will never get justice for what happened .
not_available If you do know Walker , or anything about him , or anyone who might whatever you tell us , no matter how small , would be in total confidence .
not_available And yet you offer me nothing in return .
not_available What do you mean by that ?
not_available Specifically .
not_available Just so I'm clear .
not_available Two families will get no justice , unless the FBI tells the truth about how they killed two innocent people who were doing nothing but pray .
not_available In other words , you do know something .
not_available Good
not_available bye , Ms .
not_available Mathison .
not_available Mr .
not_available Galvez .
not_available He knows Walker .
not_available You saw that , right ?
not_available I'm not crazy ?
not_available You're not crazy .
not_available I don't give a shit what it takes , that imam is going to talk to me .
not_available What it takes ?
not_available He wants a full FBI mea culpa .
not_available Good luck with that .
not_available It's not medicine , it's a drink .
not_available Dana likes the " Revive " flavor , and Chris likes the " Energy " one .
not_available And Dana's been asking a lot about Tom Walker .
not_available It's all over the Internet , and I don't really have any answers , so if you can come home as soon as you can
not_available Oh , um , I told Chris that I would take him to a movie if he got all his homework done today .
not_available He specifically asked if you would come , too , so just call me back .
not_available Okay ?
not_available This is your new home now .
not_available Come .
not_available This is Issa , my son .
not_available Assalamo Alliakum .
not_available Issa Issa .
not_available I want him to learn English , fluently .
not_available You will live here with him as long as it takes .
not_available I have no clue how to do this .
not_available I'm not a teacher .
not_available We have a problem .
not_available Hey .
not_available What , are you stalking me now ?
not_available How'd you find me here ?
not_available They spent years training me .
not_available Ah .
not_available So , what's the problem ?
not_available The imam .
not_available He'll calm down in a day or two .
not_available I don't have a day or two .
not_available He says your men fired first .
not_available I know what he's saying .
not_available He has seven eyewitnesses , including himself , saying Walker didn't shoot , or even raise a weapon at them .
not_available And ?
not_available I believe he's withholding information about Walker .
not_available You people have rubber hoses , don't you ?
not_available He's a good man caught in a bad situation .
not_available He runs a mosque that a terrorist suspect used as an escape route .
not_available He wants justice for the men who were killed , for which I think he'll tell me what he knows about Walker .
not_available Justice ?
not_available W
not_available What does that mean ?
not_available Well , for one thing it means compensation for the families .
not_available Look , if one of your men made a mistake , you need to come clean .
not_available Let me ask you something .
not_available You ever been in a firefight ?
not_available Yes .
not_available Okay .
not_available So , my men follow an armed terrorist suspect , based off intel provided by you people , at zero dark thirty into a fucking building that they don't even know is a mosque .
not_available In seconds , a member of the team thinks he has a clear shot at bringing down a terrorist , and he takes it .
not_available Accidentally , he drops two civilians in the crossfire .
not_available Shit happens .
not_available But if you think that I or the bureau are gonna let the CIA come in and throw any of my guys under the bus , you're fucking high .
not_available Hey .
not_available Hey , Issa , come closer .
not_available Don't be afraid .
not_available Come on .
not_available Want to play ?
not_available Hey .
not_available Hey , you know how to do this ?
not_available Can you do this ?
not_available Yeah ?
not_available Want to learn ?
not_available Yeah ?
not_available Look .
not_available Soccer ball .
not_available It's a soccer ball .
not_available Soccer .
not_available Can you say that ?
not_available Soccer .
not_available Soccer
not_available Hey .
not_available Hey .
not_available Hey , Issa .
not_available Hey , wait .
not_available Accidentally , he drops two civilians in the crossfire .
not_available Shit happens .
not_available But if you think that I or the bureau are gonna let the CIA come in and throw any of my guys under the bus , you're fucking high .
not_available You're really fucking something , Carrie .
not_available I got to hand it to you .
not_available There is no bridge you won't burn , no earth
not_available you won't scorch .
not_available When it comes to catching Walker , or any terrorist suspect , for that matter , damn straight .
not_available You recorded a senior FBI agent who thought he was talking off the record to someone on the same side , so you could leverage the FBI into admitting a mistake .
not_available Are you really prepared to sacrifice the very agency that , with all their manpower , is the best chance we have to get Walker ?
not_available They accidentally shot and killed two people .
not_available Now , I get that it's not easy , or even ideal , but we need to convince them to just make a statement taking responsibility .
not_available For what ?
not_available The hope that this imam will give you information that you don't even know he has ?
not_available No disrespect , David , but I think I've been in the field long enough to know a source when I see one .
not_available You will not , I repeat , not , do anything to sabotage the FBI manhunt for Walker .
not_available That is a direct order .
not_available What's happened here ?
not_available I was showing him a trick with the ball .
not_available And I , uh , I knocked over some glasses .
not_available What the hell are you doing , Carrie ?
not_available What ?
not_available Nothing .
not_available The last I checked , this was my office .
not_available Just needed somewhere private to calm down .
not_available Somewhere private ?
not_available Okay , so I was hoping you'd be here .
not_available Where have you been ?
not_available I just heard about the imam and the FBI .
not_available Estes is right .
not_available That imam knows Walker .
not_available I fucking know it , 100% .
not_available You think the Imam's bad ?
not_available No .
not_available No , that's the problem .
not_available He's practically a saint .
not_available I've got nothing on him .
not_available I've got zero leverage .
not_available You're 100% sure he's not bad ?
not_available Pretty much .
not_available So ?
not_available Maybe you're approaching the problem the wrong way around .
not_available Allahu Akbar .
not_available Allahu Akbar .
not_available Allahu Akbar .
not_available Allahu Akbar .
not_available We want justice !
not_available We want justice !
not_available We want justice !
not_available So what are we doing here ?
not_available I think they call it a Hail Mary .
not_available As salaam alaikum .
not_available Wa 'alaikumas salam .
not_available My name is Carrie .
not_available I know who you are .
not_available May I come in ?
not_available I need to speak with your husband .
not_available Please , have some tea .
not_available I'm sorry , this isn't easy .
not_available I understand .
not_available Imam , I've done my research .
not_available I know of your work in the community
not_available the woman's refuge you run with Father Rose from St .
not_available Agnes' down the street .
not_available I have no doubt you and I want the same thing .
not_available Which is a better world .
not_available And a better America .
not_available If there's another terrorist attack , this country is primed to turn on itself .
not_available You and I both know we're halfway there already .
not_available But if an attack happens that can be traced back to information that you chose to withhold when you were given the chance the mosque , this community that you worked so hard to build they'll put a match to it all .
not_available Our only hopeand
not_available it's a good one
not_available is that people like us put our heads together and help each other .
not_available Now , I need to find Tom Walker .
not_available Will you help me ?
not_available I pray what you say about another attack on America is wrong .
not_available But you're right .
not_available It takes more than just prayer .
not_available We have to help each other .
not_available Action speaks louder than words , yet so far you've done nothing but talk .
not_available What were you expecting ?
not_available The truth .
not_available Two people were tragically caught between a terrorist suspect and those whose job it is to stop more attacks on America .
not_available That is the truth .
not_available I know you know Walker .
not_available Please .
not_available If I say I have no information , I have no information .
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available In case you reconsider .
not_available Thank you for the tea .
not_available Assalamo Alliakum .
not_available Fi Amaan Allah .
not_available We want justice !
not_available We want justice !
not_available We want justice !
not_available How'd it go ?
not_available The FBI better fucking find Walker
not_available that's all I can say .
not_available " A man wants to build a home for his wife . "
not_available He loves his wife .
not_available The house must be strong to keep them safe .
not_available "
not_available Issa , that is amazing .
not_available To be able to do that this quickly ?
not_available That's truly excellent .
not_available Sometimes , I swear to God , people are their own worst enemy .
not_available Yeah , tell me about it .
not_available What are you doing , Saul ?
not_available Y
not_available You sound
not_available kind of What do we know about Walker ?
not_available We know he's a sniper .
not_available Snipers are trained to go to ground , either in plain sight or , as is the case here , that doesn't work , they blend into the wild .
not_available I think the other word for that is " disappear .
not_available "
not_available Hold on a second .
not_available Hello .
not_available Carrie , this is Zahira .
not_available Can you meet me in 15 minutes ?
not_available Yeah , of course .
not_available Hey there .
not_available Whoa , whoa , I come in peace .
not_available My bad , I didn't mean to sneak up on you like that .
not_available Don't worry about it .
not_available May I ?
not_available Sure .
not_available That sure is some work of art you got there .
not_available What is that , some sort of limited , made to measure edition ?
not_available Something like that .

not_available Good talking to you , Dan .
not_available Good luck out there .
not_available Right , y you , too .
not_available Hello , Zahira .
not_available When you came to our home , you knew it was not permitted for you to be alone with my husband .
not_available Two pairs of ears to hear what you had to say being better than one .
not_available Maybe .
not_available I love my husband , Carrie .
not_available He is a good man .
not_available I don't doubt it .
not_available I understand what you said about this country the knife edge it's on .
not_available Please , I need your word that you will not say anything to anyone about our meeting .
not_available You have it .
not_available This man Walker over the last few weeks , he has come to the mosque maybe eight or nine times .
not_available Every time , he meets with a man who does not come to the mosque to pray .
not_available Just to do business .
not_available Do you know the name of this man ?
not_available All I know is , he drives a car with the diplomatic plates .
not_available Which country ?
not_available S Saudi Arabia .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Bad dream ?
not_available Yeah ,
not_available yeah , it was .
not_available Hey , what you got there ?

not_available What is this ?
not_available What's going on ?
not_available Nicholas ?
not_available Can you hear me , Nicholas ?
not_available Nicholas .
not_available Yeah , I can hear you .
not_available You're angry .
not_available How the fuck do you think I feel ?
not_available You're also in shock .
not_available Which is why you told our friend in Washington to tell me that it's all over .
not_available I've been living the last eight years thinking I killed Tom Walker .
not_available Which I now find out is not true .
not_available Which means everything I did everything Is the peace you found in Islam a false peace ?
not_available Everything I believed in .
not_available You believed in Allah's forgiveness and , through Allah's mercy , in yourself .
not_available It was all a trick !
not_available It was based on a lie !
not_available I did not let you actually kill your friend .
not_available Isn't that good news ?
not_available What is Walker doing ?
not_available Helping .
not_available That's all you need to know .
not_available You remember the new beginning you were given ?
not_available Yes , I remember .
not_available Issa .
not_available You trusted me with Issa .
not_available Why ?
not_available Why not trust a man who would rather die than give information to his enemy ?
not_available You got your enemy to teach your own son .
not_available No , we only began as enemies , because that's what the others told us to be .
not_available Are we enemies now ?
not_available Have you forgotten ?
not_available Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack
not_available I don't care if I never get back
not_available I want to Root , root , root for the home team Finish it .
not_available Come on , brat .

not_available Let me root , root , root for the home team
not_available If they don't win , it's a shame
not_available For it's one , two , three strikes , you're out at the old ball game .
not_available ball game .

not_available You are a brat .
not_available You are a brat .
not_available And you're gonna be late for school .

not_available Issa? !
not_available Issa? !
not_available Issa? !
not_available Issa? !
not_available Issa? !
not_available Issa? !
not_available Issa ?
not_available Issa ?
not_available Issa ?
not_available Issa ?
not_available Issa Issa .
not_available Issa !
not_available I pray every day that you never lose sight of what you committed to do in Issa's name .
not_available I never wanted or planned any of this .
not_available It was your choice doing what you are doing after what happened that day .
not_available But in the end , you are a soldier , as you say .
not_available And you will either stay true to that and do what you feel is right
not_available or you will not .
not_available Alamdulilla .
not_available Nazir ?
not_available Nazir? !
not_available Nazir said that you would remember this from two years ago .
not_available At 4:42 p.m . local time , a drone missile hit and destroyed part of a compound 120 miles northeast of Mosul in the mountains of Northern Iraq from which Abu Nazir , the leader of the IPLA , is believed to have been operating .
not_available The images being broadcast on some news outlets around the world of the bodies of 83 dead children allegedly killed in the strike , we believe to be false , created by the terrorists for propaganda purposes .
not_available And they call us terrorists .
not_available Make no mistake , that in the planning of these missions , all that can be done is done to protect the innocent , in particular , the precious lives of children , while we keep our promise to hunt down the terrorists who continue to plot against As you already know , that man there , the Vice President , the former Director of the CIA , and the man most instrumental in the drone attack that killed young Issa , as he prepares to become President , he's going to want to use you , to be seen with you , his American hero , more and more .
not_available Let him .
not_available We also believe that he's going to ask you to run for political office .
not_available Say yes .
not_available This will be a signal to Abu Nazir that you are committed still to doing this .
not_available Ah , Jesus .
not_available The doctor says you should take these with food .
not_available Go out the back way .
not_available Take a right .
not_available Your car is across the street .
not_available The groceries are inside .
not_available So glad he never made the choice that he'd always regret And the tougher things got , the tougher that he stayed 
not_available That's it on the left , home of our Saudi diplomat .
not_available Diplomatic fucking immunity .
not_available Just like " Klaus " in '03 .
not_available That was the Swiss embassy in Caracas , and we nearly let Klaus slip away .
not_available I'm not losing this guy , Saul .
not_available For now , we wait and see if Mr . Zahrani does anything or goes anywhere that will help us get to Walker .
not_available You live for this shit .
not_available So I've been told .
not_available What if Mr . Zahrani doesn't give us anything anytime soon ?
not_available We figure out an elegant way to lift and interrogate him .
not_available I'm not gonna ask you where you've been all day .
not_available I know you have a lot on your mind , and a lot to process , and I'm in danger of sounding like a broken record .
not_available Oh , my God , what happened? !
not_available I got mugged .
not_available What do you mean , mugged ?
not_available As in , attacked and robbed .
not_available Are you all right ?
not_available Did you call the cops ?
not_available What good are the cops gonna do ?
not_available By the time I came round , the fuckers that did this were long gone .
not_available Where did this happen ?
not_available Grocery store parking lot .
not_available Three of the bastards .
not_available I
not_available I'm fine .
not_available I'm fine .
not_available I went to the , uh I went to the emergency room .
not_available Why didn't you call me ?
not_available They got my phone .
not_available I didn't want to worry you and the kids .
not_available Seriously , it's no big deal .
not_available Are you hurt ?
not_available Ah , a couple broken ribs .
not_available It
not_available Hey , hey .
not_available I'm fine , I'm fine .
not_available All right ?
not_available Fuck , Brody , you should've called the cops .
not_available I really don't need the attention right now .
not_available What else did they take ?
not_available Oh , a few bucks , my pride .
not_available You're all right , that's what's important .
not_available Mm hmm .
not_available You know what the worst part of it is ?
not_available I really wanted to spend the day with you and the kids .
not_available I want us to spend more time together as a family .
not_available That sounds so good .
not_available Eight years out there , I come back , I get mugged outside the grocery store .
not_available It's unbelievable .
not_available America's a violent country .
not_available What can I tell you ?
not_available Oh I'm sorry .
not_available Oh , and guess what .
not_available What ?
not_available There's a message on the voicemail from the Vice President's office .

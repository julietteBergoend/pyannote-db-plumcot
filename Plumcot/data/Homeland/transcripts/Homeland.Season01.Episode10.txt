REPORTER The USS Cole was attacked while refueling in the port of Aden .
not_available This was an act of terrorism .
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act .
not_available The next samba we're going to swing for you is one of the good old favorites .
not_available Until something stops him .
WOMAN I'm just making sure we don't get hit again .
MAN That plane crashed into the World Trade Center .
not_available Thousands of people running .
not_available We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad .
SAUL What the fuck are you doing ?
SAUL God !
CARRIE Fuck !
CARRIE I missed something once before .
not_available I won't
not_available I can't let that happen again .
SAUL It was ten years ago .
not_available Everyone missed something that day .
CARRIE Everyone's not me .
not_available Previously on Homeland You're telling me the fucking CIA thinks I'm working for alQaeda ?
not_available I think you're working for al Qaeda .
not_available We were wrong about Brody .
not_available Wait !
not_available I was I was wrong .
not_available This weekend , this time that we spent together , it was real .
not_available Hey , Carrie , fuck you .
not_available I pray every day that you never lose sight of what you committed to do in Issa's name .
not_available This is Issa , my son .
not_available I want him to learn English .
not_available " The house must be strong to keep them safe .
not_available " That's truly excellent .
WALDEN A drone missile hit and destroyed part of a compound in the mountains of Northern Iraq .
not_available The images being broadcast of the bodies of 83 dead children allegedly killed in the strike , we believe to be false , created by the terrorists for propaganda purposes .
not_available The vice presidentthe man most instrumental in the drone attack that killed young Issa is going to ask you to run for political office .
not_available Say yes .
not_available That will be a signal to Nazir that you are still committed to do this .
not_available Aileen just ID'd Tom Walker .
not_available He's the terrorist .
not_available Tom was dead .
not_available That's what they told me .
CARRIE What we need to do is find him before anything happens .
ZAHIRA Walker
not_available he meets with a man to do business .
not_available He drives a car with the diplomatic plates .
SAUL That's it on the left
not_available home of our Saudi diplomat .
not_available What if Mr . Zahrani doesn't give us anything anytime soon ?
not_available We'll figure out an elegant way to lift and interrogate him .
SAUL What do we know ?
SAUL Very little , that's what .
not_available But in our line of work , sometimes very little is just enough .
not_available Take Mansoor Al Zahrani .
not_available Mild mannered second secretary of the Saudi embassy .
not_available Seen here going to work three days ago .
not_available We surveilled him 24/7 .
not_available We've listened to every phone call he's made in the last week .
not_available We pawed through his professional life , his financial life , his personal life .
not_available In short , we turned him upside down and we shook real hard .
not_available Two items of interest fell out .
not_available Item one Al Zahrani's in debt to the tune of about $750,000 , all due to investments
not_available even I'd know better than to make .
not_available Item two Al Zahrani's gay .
not_available He's got three wives , ten children .
not_available He's a devout and conscientious Muslim .
not_available Yet , every Thursday when everyone thinks he's out jogging in Rock Creek Park , he's in fact , visiting this bathhouse off Dupont Circle .
not_available We managed to get inside during his most recent visit .
not_available As you can see , he's a naughty boy .
not_available I believe that item one and item two will get us what we want , which is for this son of a bitch to tell where Tom Walker is and what he and Abu Nazir are plotting .
not_available Most of Al Zahrani's debt is carried by a private equity bank called Market Security .
not_available As I said , we don't have much , but we definitely have something .
not_available William Pritchard ?
not_available That's me .
not_available Ah .
not_available I'm Carrie Mathison .
not_available You're really a spy ?
not_available Uh , an intelligence officer actually .
not_available This is very cool .
not_available Can I tell my wife about this ?
not_available No .
not_available Even cooler .
not_available As I mentioned on the phone , we're interested in one of your clients Mansoor Al Zahrani .
not_available Yeah , I pulled his file .
not_available Makes dismal reading .
not_available How'd you like to cause him some pain ?
not_available I'd rather have the money he owes us , but short of that , pain might be satisfying .
not_available What can I do ?
not_available We'd like to borrow your bank .
not_available You sure I can't tell my wife ?
not_available Sergeant Brody ?
not_available Yes .
not_available We need to check your house , sir .
not_available What the fuck ?
not_available We're Secret Service , sir .
not_available Sergeant Brody , sorry for the intrusion .
not_available Everyone's a little on edge because of your sniper buddy
not_available I'm afraid .
not_available I have to ask is
not_available Walker as good a shot as they say he is ?
not_available Yes , he is .
not_available Too bad for us .
not_available Clear the room .
not_available I'm very impressed with the way you've handled coming back to the real world .
not_available Thank you , sir .
not_available Representative Richard Johnson mean anything to you ?
not_available I watch the news .
not_available How would you feel about running for his seat in the upcoming special election ?
not_available I would consider it a honor to work with a man who's actually fought the war on terror .
not_available Who's lived among the enemy , and understands them .
not_available What do you think ?
not_available You interested ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available I'm interested .
not_available Good news , good news .
not_available I'd need to talk to my wife first .
not_available Is that a problem ?
not_available To be honest , it could be .
not_available Well , we need her on board .
not_available She's half the story .
not_available War hero returns home after eight years' imprisonment to his beautiful , loving wife .
not_available I'm sure you'll be able to convince her .
AGENT On the move .
not_available Al Zahrani's got diplomatic immunity .
not_available That may not mean much to you people , but to us mere mortals in the State Department , that's a serious issue .
not_available We're not dragging him to Tunisia .
not_available We're not waterboarding .
not_available We'll be very polite and gentle .
not_available I just want to ask him some questions during his lunch hour .
not_available The CIA's not even supposed to be operating on American soil .
not_available It's against your own charter .
not_available This is the FBI's job .
SAUL Al Zahrani's running a terrorist cell out of the Saudi embassy .
not_available He and Tom Walker are planning an attack on the United States .
not_available Fuck the charter .
not_available He doesn't mean that .
not_available Yes , I do .
not_available You don't know if this thing will work .
not_available You grab the guy Entice .
not_available You entice the guy into the bank , and then what ?
not_available You got a couple of hours maybe .
not_available We figure two at the outside .
not_available You have two measly hours before the Saudi embassy starts missing him .
not_available What if he doesn't turn ?
not_available Being gay in Saudi Arabia is like being the Antichrist here .
not_available I'm aware of our cultural differences with Saudi Arabia .
not_available If Al Zahrani doesn't turn and we blow the whistle on him , he can look forward to losing everything .
not_available I mean everything .
not_available I see no compelling reason not to do this .
not_available Were you not listening ?
not_available I just gave you ten of them .
not_available I'm going to the secretary on this one , David .
not_available And I will be appending all of my objections right on the fucking order .
not_available Append away .
not_available Carrie , I want you to run the interrogation .
not_available Shouldn't it be Saul ?
not_available Al Zahrani will be thrown if it's a woman .
not_available Might give us some leverage .
not_available David's right .
not_available Everything we know about Al Zahrani's in here .
not_available Are you sure you're okay with my doing this ?
not_available You're the right person for the job .
not_available Saul ?
not_available I'm fine .
not_available Remember what you said to me way back about getting the truth out of these guys ?
not_available What ?
not_available You're trying to find what makes them human , not what makes them terrorists .
not_available Sounds like good advice .
not_available Better get started .
not_available Oh , Jesus .
not_available You scared me .
not_available Sorry .
not_available Kids get to school
not_available okay ?
not_available Yeah , with the usual hysterics .
not_available Chris is convinced he's the worst athlete in the entire eighth grade , and Dana's convinced she's a lesbian , 'cause boys disgust her .
not_available What's going on ?
not_available While you were gone , I had a visitor .
not_available Who ?
not_available Vice President of the United States .
not_available In our house ?
not_available It's a mess .
not_available I doubt he noticed .
not_available What did he want ?
not_available You remember Congressman Johnson ?
not_available That poor bastard we saw on the TV at Gaines' house ?
not_available He's resigning , and they want me to run for his seat .
not_available I knew it .
not_available You said no , right ?
not_available Well , I said I'd talk it over with you first .
not_available You're actually considering it ?
not_available You can't be serious .
not_available Well , what else am I gonna do ?
not_available Hell , stay in the Corps and go back to Iraq ?
not_available Brody , we're just getting our lives back on track .
not_available We're just getting our marriage back on track .
not_available And you want to go into politics ?
not_available We'll never see you .
not_available It'll be like you're leaving us all over again .
not_available I'll carve out plenty of time for you and the kids .
not_available No .
not_available Absolutely not .
not_available You cannot do this .
not_available I think I can make a difference .
not_available Do you want our family to be dragged through the mud by every newspaper and cable news channel in the country ?
not_available Because that's what's gonna happen
not_available they're gonna dig for dirt until they found it .
not_available You don't know that .
not_available Me and Mike .
not_available You and that CIA lady you fucked .
not_available Don't be naive .
not_available It'll all come out , every last gory detail .
not_available I got to go change .
not_available I seem to have become one of those women who takes her kids to school in her pajamas .
VIRGIL Wives .

not_available He met Zahra when they were both 15 .
not_available An arranged marriage , of course .
not_available He had his first five children with her .
not_available Um Farid , Suhail Gamila , Huda and Wadiya .
not_available How can someone be 15 and married ?
not_available What could a possibly know about the intricacies of a relationship , about taking care of a family ?
not_available More than you do ?
not_available Oh Mathison .
not_available Hey , it's me , Brody .

not_available I'll text you the address .
not_available Okay , great .
not_available See you then .
not_available Hot date ?
not_available Hardly .
not_available So you're texting your address to a plumber ?
not_available It's none of your fucking business who I'm texting my address to .
not_available So you think we have enough ?
not_available You think Al Zahrani will turn ?
not_available Well , you know as well as I do , there's guys who roll over and beg and mercy , and then there's those other guys who get all heroic , and are willing to die for the cause .
not_available He's here .
not_available Are you good ?
not_available Eye contact , please .
not_available I'm good .

not_available I need to do something that matters .
not_available I've been asked by Vice President Walden to run for congress .
not_available You fucking serious ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Jess doesn't want me to do it .
not_available She's exercising her veto rights .
not_available Why ?
not_available I think she's afraid of being in the limelight .
not_available You want to do it ?
not_available I got to do something .
not_available Either that
not_available or I keep being pulled back into fucking Iraq .

not_available I'm around if you need me .
CARRIE Security .
not_available It's an unfortunate necessity these days .
not_available Security for what ?
not_available It's not like you're going to hand me cash after all .
not_available Please sit down .
not_available Let's begin .
not_available We have some questions we'd like to ask you .
not_available We don't have much time .
not_available We need to get you back to your embassy by the end of lunch hour .
not_available You're not loan officers .
not_available Who are you ?
not_available I would like to leave now .
not_available I'm afraid we can't allow that .
not_available You're CIA ?
not_available FBI ?
not_available Whoever you are , you can't hold me .
not_available I'm a Saudi diplomat .
not_available I have diplomatic protection .
not_available You know what , I'm going to call my embassy right now .
not_available This is outrageous .
not_available I will not allow it .
not_available My ambassador will go straight to the White House and you will both lose your jobs .
not_available Why don't you take a look at these photographs .
not_available Then you can call anyone you want .
not_available Here .
not_available I will not betray my country .
not_available Of course not .

not_available Your salary at the Saudi embassy is $170,000 a year .
not_available You've sold all of your stocks in the past three years .
not_available You have no savings .
not_available You have no other real estate holdings .
not_available Is that a fair summation ?
not_available Your point ?
not_available You're spending more than you make .
not_available Substantially .
not_available Is that a crime ?
not_available No , not in and of itself , but it is curious to note that you are somehow meeting all of your financial obligations .
not_available What's in Geneva ?
not_available Cuckoo clocks .
not_available Why have you traveled there six times in the past year ?
not_available Business for my government .
not_available Well , our friends in Switzerland inform us that on the morning of last Saturday , you had breakfast at the Beau Rivage Hotel with a man named Faraz Sabbaq .
not_available He handed you an envelope .
not_available You then carried this envelope to the Clariden Leu Bank on Rue Francois Versonnex .
not_available the Clariden Leu Bank without the envelope .
not_available You should know that Swiss officials had their eyes on Sabbaq , and then you of course , because he is a trusted courier for Abu Nazir .
not_available I don't know Abu Nazir .
not_available Abu Nazir gives money to Sabbaq , Sabbaq hands money to you , you deposit the money in a Swiss bank and use it to pay your bills .
not_available Why lose everything for a cause you don't even believe in ?
not_available You're obviously not a zealot .
not_available You don't believe in radical Islam .
not_available You love the West .
not_available No more questions .
not_available I am done talking to both of you .
not_available Do you really want me to share these photos with your wives , your children , your parents , your ambassador ?
not_available Go ahead .

not_available Sit the fuck down !
not_available I'm not finished !
not_available Oh , I think you are .
not_available Mr .
not_available Al Zahrani , I'd like to remind you
not_available You love your children very much , don't you ?
not_available Do you have a favorite ?
not_available No , of course not .
not_available I think Janine is your favorite .
not_available She is a very remarkable young woman , but all of my children are remarkable .
not_available Not one of your other children is a sophomore at Yale majoring in political philosophy .
not_available Not one of your other children was a National Merit Scholar .
not_available Not one of your other children has spent two full days with you at the Phillips Gallery , happily looking at your beloved Impressionists .
not_available We would deport her .
not_available And we would make sure that she was not welcome in England , or Germany , or France , or Italy , or even all forgiving Scandinavia .
not_available We would make sure that she had no choice but to go back to Saudi Arabia and get fat and wear a burkha for the rest of her miserable life .
not_available What do you do for Abu Nazir in return for the money he gives you ?
not_available What do you do for Abu Nazir in return for the money he give you ?
not_available I keep my ears open .
not_available Tell him what the Saudi government is thinking .
not_available General information .
not_available You met with Tom Walker at least three times at the Mount Olivet Mosque last week , correct ?
not_available Yes .
not_available Tom Walker is working for Abu Nazir ?
not_available Yes .
not_available Was he meant to shoot the president from the roof of a house near Ronald Reagan Airport ?
not_available I don't know anything about that .
not_available Where is Tom Walker now ?
not_available He's lying low .
not_available Where ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available What's his current assignment ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available When will you know ?
not_available When Abu Nazir decides to tell me .
not_available What the tradecraft for setting a meeting with Walker ?
not_available I put my child's drawing of a red heart in the window of my living room .
not_available When would the meeting take place ?
not_available The next day at noon .
not_available Where ?
not_available Farragut Square by the fountain .
SAUL Mr .
not_available Al Zahrani , I'd like you to go back to your house now , put that drawing in your window tonight .
not_available Tomorrow afternoon , I'd like you to proceed as you normally would to meet Tom Walker .
not_available Okay ?
not_available So I'm bait ?
not_available You're bait .
not_available You're free to go now .
not_available What happens to me after all of this ?
not_available Go about your business , live your life .
not_available We say nothing to Saudi intelligence about your connections to Abu Nazir , you say nothing to Abu Nazir about our little get together .
not_available You work for us now .

not_available He's trying , Jess , he's really trying .
not_available He told me about being asked to run for congress .
not_available Told me you were against it .
not_available I'm just thinking of the family .
not_available What's best for the family .
not_available Jess , right now , Brody's a marine without a mission .
not_available He's a lost man wandering around in the fog .
not_available This thing , really means a lot to him .
not_available He wants to be of service .
not_available He wants to do this .
not_available Let him .
not_available He'll be a better father , a better husband .
not_available He put you up to this .
not_available Yeah , he did .
not_available So what ?
not_available He's right .
not_available That's unbelievable .
not_available He comes to you and now here you are , on his behalf ?

not_available Vice President Walden wants me to run for Congressman Johnson's seat .
not_available Really ?
not_available Wow .
not_available Well , that's .
not_available That's surprising .

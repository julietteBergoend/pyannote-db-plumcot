not_available Trade Center .
not_available Without warning , a bomb exploded beneath the building .
not_available The USS Cole was attacked This was an act of terrorism .
not_available It was a despicable and cowardly act .
not_available The next song we're going to play for you is one of the good old favorites .
not_available Until something shocks him I'm just making sure we don't get hit again .
not_available That plane crashed into the World Trade Center .
not_available Running up
not_available We must we will be vigilant .
not_available What the fuck are you doing ?
not_available God !
not_available Fuck !
not_available I missed something once before .
not_available I won't
not_available I can't let that happen again .
not_available It was ten years ago .
Previously on Homeland An American prisoner of war has been turned .
not_available Well , that's one interpretation , but that's all it is at the moment .
not_available Jessica , it's me Brody .
not_available If he is a terrorist , we need eyes and ears on Brody from the minute he steps off that plane .
not_available Out of the question .
not_available The terrorists are still out there .
not_available We need Brody in the public eye reminding America that this is far from over .
not_available What if he's not up for it psychologically ?
not_available Just a couple questions , Sergeant Brody .
not_available You got ten seconds to get off my property .
not_available The The brass sent you over here to turn me into some fucking poster boy for their bullshit war .
not_available Abu Nazir ?
not_available Was he ever present during any of your interrogations ?
not_available No .
not_available You are the only Agency asset to have had eyes on Nazir in seven years .
not_available You know that they stone women like me to death if we get caught doing anything that we're not supposed to ?
not_available I won't let anything happen to you .
not_available So Abu Nazir's resurfacing just as Brody has miraculously returned home means nothing ?
not_available Dots are there , Carrie , but you haven't connected them yet .
not_available Wait , there's no camera in the garage ?
not_available Jesus Christ , Virgil !
not_available Allahu akbar .
not_available Allahu akbar .
not_available Aamir .
not_available Shh .
not_available Stay there .
not_available What are you doing ?
not_available Nothing , Aamir .
not_available Just getting dressed .
not_available Oh , it's beautiful , Aamir .
not_available You're beautiful .
not_available I'd like to swap out this couch , please .
not_available And the painting .
not_available Something a little less Motel 6 .
not_available I'll do what I did for the McCain 2009 interview .
not_available Highest ratings ever .
not_available You know , I missed that one .
not_available I was out of the country .
not_available Of course .
not_available Okay .
not_available Oh , shit .
not_available Carrie , would you get in here ?
not_available What is it ?
not_available It's a crew member from the network .
not_available They're about to move the couch where we have a contact mic mounted to the baseboard .
not_available Holy mother of fuck .
not_available Okay , wait a second .
not_available Wait a second .
not_available Can you you put that down ?
not_available And can we get the painting back on the wall , where it belongs ?
not_available We'll stick with Motel 6 .
not_available Just do it .
not_available All right , I'm going to be late for my briefing .
not_available Let me know who wins .
not_available Look , we're broadcasting a special here in two days .
not_available The homecoming of an American hero .
not_available I know what the audience wants .
not_available You need to trust me .
not_available No , I don't .
not_available Okay .
not_available Keep the couch .
not_available It's great .
not_available Let's just let's have you take a seat right there , please .
not_available They back at it ?
not_available Looks like .
not_available She has no idea who she's dealing with .
not_available I had no idea he had such , uh , strong feelings about home decor .
not_available It's probably the only thing to him that seems the same .
not_available I kept everything exactly the same the whole time he was gone .
not_available Not everything .
not_available I'm not going to do this interview .
not_available It's a complete joke .
not_available They're trying to make us into some perfect family .
not_available You are the perfect family .
not_available No , we're not .
not_available Well , not you , maybe , but the rest of them .
not_available Your brother's a Boy Scout , literally .
not_available Your mother , she's got this whole MILF thing going .
not_available And your father I mean , Sergeant Brody , he's a hero .
not_available Yeah , he is .
not_available So leave the rest of us out of it .
not_available Okay , suggestion , if I may .
not_available Do the interview , right ?
not_available But do something crazy .
not_available Like what ?
not_available Light my hair on fire ?
not_available Wear a burka .
not_available Every time the interviewer asks a question , tell him to go shut the fuck up .
not_available Mm hmm .
not_available Look , the whole country will be watching , right ?
not_available And you can say whatever you want .
not_available Tell the truth .
not_available The truth would be interesting .
not_available Intelligence work has led us to this man .
not_available Prince Farid Bin Abbud , also known to his friends as Freddie .
not_available We spent years chasing rumors that the prince funded terrorists .
not_available But we've never had proof until a meeting between the prince and Abu Nazir was videotaped by this woman .
not_available Lynne Reed .
not_available A CIA asset and member of the prince's personal retinue .
not_available We're running a hooker ?
not_available If , by hooker , you mean someone who's out there risking her life while we're sitting around a conference table , then yeah , we are .
not_available I just received word from her that she successfully downloaded the prince's cell phone onto an I X chip .
not_available I'll be retrieving it first thing tomorrow .
not_available Very good .
not_available So , immediately after his meeting with Abu Nazir , the prince came here to DC .
not_available We believe the purpose of his visit is to move funds to one of Abu Nazir's people here in the United States .
not_available If we can flag the transfer , we can follow the money to Nazir's operative .
not_available The prince is a global guy .
not_available He lives on that phone that Lynne Reed just downloaded for us , so should be a good place to start .
not_available Questions .
not_available You say you believe the prince is here for the purpose of transferring funds .
not_available Why ?
not_available Like I said , the timing of the trip following on the heels of the prince's meeting with Abu Nazir in Cypress .
not_available My understanding is the prince comes to the United States every year about this time .
not_available To top off his harem , not to fund terrorism .
not_available Saul .
not_available What was that about ?
not_available It was a legitimate question .
not_available So ask me offline .
not_available Don't torpedo my briefing .
not_available It was a question , Carrie , not an act of war .
not_available Abu Nazir's express goal is an attack on our country .
not_available It's his holy grail .
not_available No one doubts that .
not_available Well , half the reason I think Abu Nazir has something in the works now is Brody , and
not_available you know I can't talk about that .
not_available So let me see if I understand this .
not_available You think when I ask you the same exact question I'd ask anyone else , that really , I'm just giving you a hard time ?
not_available Is that it ?
not_available Got a meeting to get to .
not_available Dana .
not_available Where were you ?
not_available With friends .
not_available You missed the prep for the interview .
not_available Yeah , that was kind of the point .
not_available Hey .
not_available Sorry .
not_available Sorry .
not_available Can I go ?
not_available No .
not_available Sure .
not_available I didn't mean to confuse things .
not_available So you know , she's always like this .
not_available It's not you .
not_available You sure ?
not_available Ask her to do anything , and the attitude goes up like a wall .
not_available I mean , she's obviously got a secret life going on out there .
not_available Well , she's 16 .
not_available Only 16 .
not_available Well , I meant , didn't you have a secret life when you were that age ?
not_available Yeah , with you .
not_available That was different .
not_available You want me to try talking to her ?
not_available Please .
not_available Be my guest .
not_available If I run into any trouble , I'll send up a flare .
not_available I don't know .
not_available It's funny , though , isn't it ?
not_available You actually went swimming .
not_available I thought that was the idea .
not_available So what exactly are you expecting to find on that ?
not_available These operations need money , right ?
not_available You think it's coming from Farid ?
not_available He's certainly got enough of it .
not_available So now we look for something out of the ordinary on the download you got us .
not_available Electronic wire with odd routing a meeting he takes with someone new , outside his usual circle a transfer of money I'll know it when I see it .
not_available Are you sure about this , about Farid being part of an attack ?
not_available Pretty much
not_available , yeah .
not_available Because I've been right beside him for over a year
not_available and all I've seen is a nice guy with a few sexual quirks .
not_available He gave me this amazing necklace yesterday .
not_available He didn't have to , he doesn't owe me .
not_available I swear , it actually meant something to him .
not_available I'm sure it did .
not_available He's taking us all clubbing tonight , to show off the new girls .
not_available That's what his whole life is about .
not_available Just having fun .
not_available I know it must seem that way , but the man you recorded him with , Abu Nazir
not_available , you know he's the real deal .
not_available We never would have been able to get this any other way .
not_available You should feel really good about what you've done .
not_available Well , I have downloaded his phone for you .
not_available I'm done .
not_available What about you ?
not_available Me ?
not_available No .
not_available I'm never done .
not_available Shouldn't you be getting ready for your interview ?
not_available They pushed it back a couple hours .
not_available Are you nervous ?
not_available No .
not_available I was told Lawrence O'Donnell gives everyone a hard time except guys in uniform .
not_available Chris !
not_available Dana !
not_available Breakfast !
not_available So you know Chris is all about sugar in the morning , usually Cocoa Pebbles .
not_available Dana doesn't touch breakfast .
not_available It's as if you're trying to poison her .
not_available So what were you two talking about last night ?
not_available Huh ?
not_available I heard Dana laughing , it was hard not to .
not_available What was so funny ?
not_available Oh .
not_available It was this video called YouTube .
not_available Have you seen it ?
not_available The dog talking about food ?
not_available No , not that one .
not_available I saw a cat that smokes .
not_available It was really quite funny .
not_available Hey .
not_available Want some ?
not_available No , thanks .
not_available I'll take some .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Looks good .
not_available Lack of porn is a little surprising , given the prince's reputation .
not_available You know , at your briefing yesterday , I didn't mean anything , calling your asset a hooker .
not_available Want to make it up to me ?
not_available Find me evidence of a money transfer .
not_available Start with the encrypted files .
not_available Really , it's important .
not_available Saul .
not_available I just picked up the download from Lynne Reed .
not_available Anything there ?
not_available Crypto's processing it now .
not_available Hopefully we'll know in a couple hours .
not_available Good .
not_available I got a meeting to go to Meeting to go to , sure .
not_available How long are you going to keep doing this ?
not_available When are you going to forgive me for screwing up ?
not_available I forgive you , Carrie .
not_available No , you don't .
not_available I really don't want to get into this here .
not_available I lied to you
not_available , it was wrong , I understand that .
not_available Do you ?
not_available Good .
not_available Saul Everyone lies in this business , I accept that .
not_available But we all draw a line somewhere , and the two sides of that line are " us " and " them . "
not_available And whatever we had , you and I , whatever trust we built up over a decade of me protecting you , teaching you everything I know , you destroyed it when you lied to me
not_available and you treated me like " them, " like every other schmuck in this building .
not_available Now , when you say you understand , is that what you mean ?
not_available What was it like , hearing your liberators rolling in ?
not_available Well , they flew in .
not_available Which I didn't know at the time .
not_available I was in a pretty deep bunker , so I couldn't really hear what was going on .
not_available Then I heard a massive firefight .
not_available I knew there'd be casualties , but at the moment the door to my bunker blew in , I still didn't know which side had won .
not_available Then a flashbang went off , which blinded me .
not_available And I just braced for the end .
not_available It took a while to work out what had really happened .
not_available That you were free .
not_available Yeah .
not_available Sergeant Brody , your commanders showed us the results of your initial medical exam .
not_available Yes .
not_available There's a section , " Scars and Other Identifying Marks .
not_available " It goes on for nearly two pages .
not_available You were beaten .
not_available No
not_available Yes .
not_available Tortured .
not_available That's right .
not_available To what end ?
not_available To what end ?
not_available What did they want from you ?
not_available They want you to lose faith .
not_available Lose faith in your country , which they say is the devil .
not_available In your brother Marines , who they say aren't coming for you because you have no military value .
not_available In your wife , who they say's got her arms wrapped around someone else .
not_available How do you resist that ?
not_available You can't .
not_available Except by believing that those people they want you to renounce , that they're keeping the faith in you , and you owe it to them to do the same .
not_available Semper fidelis .
not_available Yeah .
not_available Your father did his interview this morning .
not_available Good .
not_available It is good , I think .
not_available To talk about it .
not_available To ten million people ?
not_available You think that's good ?
not_available Okay .
not_available I get that you don't want to do the interview with us .
not_available I don't really think anybody wants to hear what it is I have to say .
not_available Thank you for your order .
not_available Please move forward to the window .
not_available Welcome to Gaucho Taco .
not_available We'll be with you in a minute .
not_available What's good here ?
not_available Well , it's 59 cent tacos , Mom .
not_available I'm sure it's all delicious .
not_available Look , Dana , I know this is hard .
not_available Your father was gone for eight years .
not_available And now he's back .
not_available That's not it , Mom .
not_available He's back
not_available and there's a camera crew at our house , when what we really need is some privacy .
not_available But that's his job now , to be a public figure .
not_available And it's our job to be there for him .
not_available We owe him that .
not_available Dana , I do listen .
not_available I know you think it's phony , putting us up on stage , and you're not wrong
not_available Well , Mom , it'd be a lot less phony if you weren't fucking his good friend Mike .
not_available I'm not .
not_available Oh , please , Mom .
not_available With your black sleazy thongs always drying in the bathroom , and him coming over to " help out .
not_available " Do you really think I'm an idiot ?
not_available Dana , I thought he was dead .
not_available We all did .
not_available But he's not , Mom .
not_available And he comes home , to this devoted wife , and everyone is in on the secret except him .
not_available Nice .
not_available Welcome home .
not_available Dana !
not_available Dana .
not_available Your father can never hear about any of this .
not_available It would really hurt him .
not_available Him , or you , Mom ?
not_available Him , both of us , our entire family , do you understand that ?
not_available Dana , I need you to promise .
not_available Hi .
not_available Hello .
not_available This must be Jessica and Dana .
not_available That's right
not_available , it's my wife and my daughter .
not_available I just stopped by to say hi before the family interview tomorrow .
not_available Give us a chance to get acquainted .
not_available So Good we're all here .
not_available You're late .
not_available Yeah , sorry .
not_available Where's Max ?
not_available He went home when the shift ended , like I should have .
not_available Please tell me you found something .
not_available Well , as a matter of fact , I did .
not_available Hello .
not_available This must be Jessica and Dana .
not_available Yes , my wife , my daughter .
not_available I just stopped by to say hi before the family interview tomorrow .
not_available Is that ?
not_available Lawrence O'Donnell , I know .
not_available Here , watch this .
not_available You know that family interview they're all getting ready for ?
not_available She knows .
not_available Dana does .
not_available About us .
not_available I mean , how ?
not_available We were so careful .
not_available When you said you " had something, " I thought you meant something big .
not_available Well , this is big .
not_available No , I mean like a bomb .
not_available Or a call from Abu Nazir .
not_available I picked up the downlink from Lynne Reed today , and after all we went through , there's nothing on it .
not_available I need to find something here .
not_available Hey , aren't you the one who's always telling me to be patient ?
not_available I don't have time to be patient .
not_available I have three weeks left and we're sitting around watching this , whatever it is , this reality show .
not_available Hey , have you eaten ?
not_available I noticed there's some spaghetti in the cupboard .
not_available It's only ten years past its expiration date .
not_available I'm sure it won't kill us .
not_available All right .
not_available So what do we do ?
not_available Just wait for the prince ?
not_available That's right
not_available , you wait , and you look beautiful , and you try and enjoy yourself .
not_available Think you can manage that ?
not_available I can certainly try .
not_available Here's a question .
not_available How do I get one of those ?
not_available Are you all right ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Fine .
not_available It's all yours .
not_available Another bottle .
not_available Easy .
not_available Pace yourself .
not_available I know .
not_available We have all night .
not_available You have two years .
not_available I'm not so sure about that one .
not_available His Highness says she reminds him of you when you first started .
not_available His Highness has a special favor to ask .
not_available A job he wants you to do .
not_available A job ?
not_available He's meeting with a businessman tomorrow a new acquaintance .
not_available He'd like you to go there tonight and make the man feel welcome .
not_available Make him feel welcome ?
not_available Aamir said that ?
not_available He said he wishes to make a good impression .
not_available Why didn't he tell me that himself ?
not_available The prince can be excruciatingly indirect in making his wishes known but for that , he has me .
not_available Is there a problem ?
not_available No .
not_available No problem .
not_available Good .
not_available The driver's waiting .
not_available I need to freshen up first .
not_available Hurry .
not_available Hey .
not_available You awake ?
not_available Brody , a lot's happened in eight years .
not_available There's a lot we need to talk about .
not_available I just want you to know that , when you're ready , so am I. Do
not_available you hear me ?
not_available Mm hmm .
not_available I want to try again .
not_available Got any tomatoes ?
not_available In the crisper .
not_available Any from this century ?
not_available Uh , in the cupboard , there might be a jar of something .
not_available No .
not_available Take yours off .
not_available Please , take it off .
not_available Let me .
not_available No .
not_available It's better if you don't .
not_available Hello .
not_available Hey , it's Lynne .
not_available Lynne , where are you ?
not_available I'm out .
not_available Uh , it's getting weird .
not_available What do you mean ?
not_available Did you find anything on that cell phone ?
not_available That transfer you were talking about ?
not_available No , not yet .
not_available I think I may have found it .
not_available They just asked me to go entertain some new business acquaintance that the prince is meeting tomorrow .
not_available Who ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available It's somebody he's trying to impress .
not_available You sound worried .
not_available Normally , we don't even talk to any man but the prince , and they want me to go meet him now .
not_available The backupthey're going to be able to follow me , right ?
not_available What ?
not_available The people protecting me where are they ?
not_available Yeah , they'll be right behind you .
not_available Don't worry , we have your back .
not_available Just keep your phone on .
not_available We'll be able to track you that way .
not_available Okay .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Her protection ?
not_available Where's your van ?
not_available Lynne's about to meet the prince's new business partner .
not_available She's a welcome gift .
not_available Carrie , what did you tell her ?
not_available You heard what I told her .
not_available What was I supposed to say ?
not_available No , Estes didn't give you a protection detail ?
not_available Now , come on , we finally got a break .
not_available I'm not seeing her phone .
not_available Why isn't this working ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available Just trace her .
not_available Since when did they make R Street a one way ?
not_available Okay , we've got her .
not_available Where's the map ?
not_available Just give it a second , will ya ?
not_available Okay .
not_available All right , she's still at the club .
not_available Lynne Reed ?
not_available Where we going ?
not_available Hay Adams .
not_available You been before ?
not_available Many times .
not_available Careful .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Nice hotel .
not_available Very nice .
not_available So how did you get hooked up with these guys , may I ask ?
not_available Okay , I get it , none of my business .
not_available You're right .
not_available It's just they paid cash , substantial tip in advance .
not_available I mean substantial .
not_available Wouldn't mind being on the permanent list is all .
not_available Well , take care of me
not_available and I'll put in a good word for you .
not_available Thank you .
not_available You're very kind .
not_available Just leave me your card .
not_available Which way are they going ?
not_available We're nearly there .
not_available Which way are they going? !
not_available They're not going anywhere .
not_available She's not moving .
not_available Where are they ?
not_available Behind the club .
not_available Turn there .
not_available You think that's a good idea ?
not_available Turn there !
not_available Shit .
not_available Carrie , Carrie , wait !
not_available Carrie !
not_available Carrie , there is nothing to be done here , okay ?
not_available They made her .
not_available Come on , we can't be seen .
not_available Shit .
not_available Shit .
not_available Shit .
not_available Fuck .
not_available Where's your father ?
not_available Don't know .
not_available Where's Dana ?
not_available Don't know that either .
not_available They drove off together about a half hour ago .
not_available If she doesn't do the interview , does that mean I don't get to do it either ?
not_available I mean , it's not that I don't appreciate all that she does .
not_available It's just , you know , there are some things that I don't appreciate .
not_available Yeah , so ignore them .
not_available Yeah ,
not_available but it's
not_available I mean it's stuff that I don't think anyone would appreciate .
not_available I mean , it's stuff that I don't think you would appreciate .
not_available What are you looking for ?
not_available You'll see .
not_available What are these ?
not_available Historical artifacts .
not_available Look .
not_available You and Mom .
not_available Mm hmm .
not_available Each padlock put here by couples who thought they'd stay together forever .
not_available I wonder how many did .
not_available Not many , I bet .
not_available Why are you even showing these to me ?
not_available Because it's never easy .
not_available A lot of things can happen .
not_available You know , when I went over to Afghanistan , you were in third grade .
not_available Chris was about this size .
not_available Your mom and I were almost still like newlyweds .
not_available That's what I took over there with me .
not_available You were in a play that year .
not_available The Wackadoo Zoo .
not_available Oh , you were so good .
not_available I can't believe that you remember that .
not_available Honey , it's practically all I thought about for eight years .
not_available It kept me alive .
not_available But now I'm back .
not_available Now all those things that kept me going , they've gone .
not_available All the people have moved on , things have changed .
not_available And what's replaced it , well , doesn't make any sense to me .
not_available Not yet , at least .
not_available You know , I'm kind of struggling for things to hold on to .
not_available And your mom's struggling , too .
not_available You should cut her some slack .
not_available We both should .
not_available Yeah .
not_available So why are you even doing this stupid interview then , if things don't make sense ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available Maybe just to keep the peace .
not_available What are you going to say ?
not_available Well , I'm not going to lie .
not_available But I'm not going to tell the truth , either .
not_available I'm not going to tell a bunch of total strangers what I just told you .
not_available Hey .
not_available Go ahead .
not_available She was , um , DOA at Providence .
not_available Two rounds , point blank .
not_available Apparently , they had her wearing some crown jewel type necklace
not_available that's , uh , vanished , so
not_available local law enforcement is saying it's a robbery gone wrong .
not_available That's good for us , keeps us out of it .
not_available You get anything off the prince's cell finally ?
not_available Yeah , it fits .
not_available Saudis must have made her somehow , decided to take her out .
not_available I want to talk to Prince Farid .
not_available DC police already did .
not_available I've got the interview , if you want to see .
not_available You okay ?
not_available This guy is a Marine , right ?
not_available I thought they were supposed to be on time .
not_available Okay , that's good , Tim .
not_available I like that there .
not_available Keep that .
not_available Come on , let's go put on your nice clothes .
not_available Hey .
not_available Hey .
not_available You ready ?
not_available I'm gonna go change .
not_available Mike .
not_available Uh , uh uh , she was my employee .
not_available Uh , for nearly two years .
not_available And this necklace , it was a present from you ?
not_available Yes .
not_available To your employee ?
not_available I'm told it was worth quite a lot of money .
not_available She was worth a lot .
not_available To me .
not_available She was a beautiful soul .
not_available She
not_available She would never hurt anybody .
not_available So , wipe that look off your face , and you find out who did this to her .
not_available Find out !
not_available It continues in that vein .

not_available You let them leave ?
not_available If it makes a difference , State Department made the call .
not_available Said it wasn't worth antagonizing the Saudis .
not_available Yeah , you mean she wasn't worth antagonizing them .
not_available It hurts to lose an asset , Carrie .
not_available I get that .
not_available But she's gone .
not_available And Abu Nazir is still out there .
not_available What we need now is a new way to find him .
not_available I'm sitting in the home of Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody , his wife Jessica , and his two children Chris and Dana .
not_available A family that put a yellow ribbon on the tree for eight years while Sergeant Brody was presumed dead in Iraq , when , in fact , he was being held as a prisoner of war under brutal conditions .
not_available So , a lot of adjustments to make , I'm sure .
not_available How has the homecoming been ?
not_available Well It's been great .
not_available For all of us .
not_available It's been really , really great to have him back .

not_available Never been to DC before .
not_available What did you tell them ?
not_available Nothing .
not_available It's all hush hush .
not_available They're not idiots , though .
not_available They know her so called job was traveling with a Saudi prince .
not_available I don't think there's any illusions what he was paying her for .
not_available She wasn't just some escort .
not_available She worked for us .
not_available She gave her life for this country .
not_available That's what I wanted to say .
not_available That's what any human being would say to these people , that she was good , that we owed it to her to protect her .
not_available But I I could not say that .
not_available I couldn't say that because it's a secret ; I'm not allowed .
not_available And I was thinking , this is a fucked up business .
not_available This is a fucked up business , and I Are you done ?
not_available No .
not_available No , I'm just gonna keep talking and talking ,
not_available so you can't say you have some meeting to go to or make up whatever other excuse
not_available you're gonna make up , so you don't have to deal with me .
not_available Carrie .
not_available Everyone's left .
not_available There's no meetings to go to .
not_available She called me from the club ten minutes before she was killed .
not_available She asked if I had protection on her , and I said yes .
not_available What do you want me to say ?
not_available It matters ?
not_available It doesn't matter ?
not_available Don't worry , it'll all be fine ?
not_available Just say something .
not_available Because when you cut me out , I'm all alone out here
not_available and I can't stand it .
not_available They made your informant .
not_available Killed her .
not_available And I didn't stop them .
not_available So , this transfer you had everybody looking for Never happened .
not_available And now they're gone .
not_available But the prince was so broken up about her really , really sad .
not_available I
not_available I can't believe he knew they were going to kill her .
not_available What made you think he was even involved ?
not_available The video of him with Abu Nazir that Lynne Reed shot .
not_available Which was what exactly ?
not_available Their conversation was benign , what little we could hear of it .
not_available An exchange of pleasantries .
not_available Nothing more .
not_available Maybe Abu Nazir really went on that boat to talk to someone else .
not_available Someone in the prince's entourage .
not_available Someone without his means ?
not_available If the prince wants to fund something , he's got the resources .
not_available Not everbody does .
not_available You're looking for a money transfer , right ?
not_available Transfer of money from a nomadic culture that has always known jewelry is the easiest way to move wealth .
not_available Tell me again about the necklace she was wearing .
not_available Five hundred thousand .
not_available Three fifty .
not_available Four hundred .
not_available Where did the money go ?
not_available Could be anywhere .
not_available Congratulations .
not_available Not many young couples can manage their first home all cash .
not_available Thank you .
not_available I hope you'll be happy here .
not_available I'm , uh ,

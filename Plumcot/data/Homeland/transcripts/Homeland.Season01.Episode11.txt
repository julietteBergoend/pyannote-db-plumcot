Previously p.m .
not_available a drone missile hit and destroyed part of a compound in the mountains of northern Iraq .
not_available The images being broadcast of the bodies of 83 dead children allegedly killed in the strike we believe to be false , created for propaganda purposes .
not_available And they call us terrorists .
not_available The Vice President , the man most instrumental in the drone attack , is going to want to use you .
not_available Get as close to him as you possibly can .
not_available Representative Richard Johnson mean anything to you ?
not_available I watch the news .
not_available How would you feel about running for his seat in the upcoming special election ?
not_available I'm interested .
not_available A political office ?
not_available What are you talking about ?
not_available I don't want to do it if there's even a chance the media would find out about us .
SAUL Al Zahrani's running a terrorist cell out of the Saudi embassy .
not_available He and Tom Walker are planning an attack on the United States .
not_available Who are you ?
not_available You're CIA ?
not_available What's the tradecraft for setting a meeting with Walker ?
not_available I put my child's drawing of a red heart in the window of my living room .
SAUL I'd like you to go back to your house now ,
SAUL put that drawing in your window tonight .
not_available So , I'm bait ?
not_available It could be Walker .
not_available It's hard to tell .
not_available I can't see his face .
not_available I need visual confirmation .
SAUL He's approaching Al Zahrani .
not_available Saul , what's in the fucking briefcase? !
not_available Everyone , get out of here !
not_available Carrie ?
not_available The President's a busy man , David .
not_available He wants his helicopter ungrounded .
not_available Not when we're seeing increased chatter with references to Marine One .
not_available He's been briefed , it doesn't faze him .
not_available Well , tell him it should .
not_available I did .
not_available So ?
not_available So he's the leader of the free world , David .
not_available He doesn't enjoy looking like some impotent asshole , which is how this guy Walker's making us all look .
not_available He'll look even worse if his helicopter gets blown out of the sky .
not_available Tell him that .
not_available What have we got ?
not_available You are kidding me .
not_available Nope .
not_available of our operation to get Walker .
not_available And that's just on the intelligence side .
not_available So how do I find the leak ?
not_available You can start by looking around you .
not_available Goddamn it .
not_available Sir .
not_available Yeah ?
not_available The Vice President wants to see you .
not_available He's here ?
not_available No , sir .
not_available Succession protocol requires him to be on lockdown as long as the threat to the President remains red .
not_available He's in his bunker .
not_available Where's Carrie ?
not_available Still in the hospital .
not_available She's supposed to be released in a few hours .
not_available Good .
not_available Tell her we need her here .
not_available Yes , sir .
CARRIE Green .
not_available No , green .
not_available I was specific about that , and I don't see what the problem is .
not_available (panting)
not_available And blue is what is available .
not_available Okay , green is important .
not_available Green is necessary .
not_available It doesn't make sense if it isn't green , and it's really not an unreasonable request .
not_available Carrie ?
not_available Saul , thank God !
not_available My green pen is dry .
not_available I asked four , five , six times for a new one , but there's no understanding .
not_available They offered me blue , they offered me black .
not_available I mean , is green so hard ?
not_available Is green elusive ?
not_available I mean , my kingdom for a fucking green pen !
not_available She's yours ?
not_available Yes .
not_available She should go to her room .
not_available The doctor will be in .
not_available Okay , I am laser focused on the green , but there's more .
not_available There's many , many , many , many more .
not_available The thing is , Saul , that Abu Nazir has methods and patterns and priorities .
not_available A single sniper ?
not_available No , no .
not_available Abu Nazir doesn't do that .
not_available He never has , he never will .
not_available He goes big !
not_available He explodes !
not_available He maims en masse , we know that .
not_available Slow down , slow down .
not_available Facts facts are facts , and we have about a week , maybe less , to figure out the real target , not this single shot to the president , spynovel 101 bullshit .
not_available Well , actually , that's the working theory .
not_available Well , it's wrong .
not_available It's , it's incomplete .
not_available Walker's not even critical !
not_available He's just a part , a piece , a pixel .
not_available A pawn of no importance .
not_available There is a bigger , pernicious Abu Nazir worthy plot out there , and we have little time .
not_available We have to code it , collide it , collapse it , contain it .
not_available Lie down , Carrie .
not_available The doctor's coming .
not_available Okay , the important thing now is the green pen .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Why Gettysburg ?
not_available You heard why .
not_available He wants to spend time with his family .
not_available Yeah , but it has to be in Pennsylvania ?
not_available I mean , it can't be here ?
not_available Can you just help , please ?
not_available Mom , I have plans tonight with Xander .
not_available He already bought tickets .

not_available Is it time yet ?
not_available Are we going ?
not_available Going ?
not_available To work .
not_available We gotta hop to .
not_available We gotta haul ass to Langley .
not_available They have to understand , Saul .
not_available Nazir's movements in green after a fallow yellow always creeping towards purple are methodical , meaningful momentous and monstrous .
not_available Okay , I'm gonna get you a bit more Ativan to settle you down .
not_available I don't need to settle down !
not_available Tell him !
not_available Saul , tell him .
not_available Carrie
not_available you're not yourself .
not_available Of course I am !
not_available No .
not_available I can't follow you .
not_available You're talking very fast .
not_available Your thoughts are running together .
not_available All these ideas
not_available I
not_available I
not_available I can't understand .
not_available Is there a doctor we should call ?
not_available My sister .

not_available Complain to Ma , she's the one that got it for me .
not_available Really ?
not_available Careful , careful !
not_available I'm driving .
not_available Jack me to Gettysburg , and this is what you get .

not_available " Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on " this continent a new nation , conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal .
not_available " What's four score ?
not_available Four times 20 .
not_available Lincoln means " 87 years ago . "
not_available He's talking about the American Revolution of 1776 .
not_available Why didn't he just say that ?
not_available You'll see when we get there .
not_available How far are we now ?
not_available Three score miles .
not_available Hey , come on .
not_available Holy shit !
not_available Dana !
not_available Really ?
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available I just hadn't realized Dad's scars were so faded .
not_available I mean , you can barely see 'em now .
not_available She'll be here , right ?
not_available I mean , she said she was on her way ?
not_available Maggie will come .
not_available Maggie's reliable .
not_available You can count on Maggie every time .
not_available Is she an especially slow driver ?
not_available Okay Huh ?
not_available This is red and blue , it's not red or blue .
not_available Okay .
not_available Maybe she got pulled over .
not_available (mutters)
not_available This whole box is dogs , really .
not_available She can fix this , right ?
not_available She said she was bringing medication .
not_available The question is what wakes them ?
not_available Is it a whisper , a crash , a deep internal pain ?
not_available How about a glass of water ?
not_available Hi .
not_available Hi .
not_available She's manic ?
not_available I don't know , you tell me .
not_available Hi , Carrie .
not_available Hi , Maggie .
not_available You look so professional .
not_available So this isn't new ?
not_available No .
not_available She's bi polar .
not_available She's stable on her meds .
not_available The explosion must have sent her into a flight .
not_available Why didn't she ever tell me ?
not_available She said no one at work could know .
not_available Right .
not_available So what do we do ?
not_available We'll up her Lithium .
not_available We're giving her Clonazepam to start leveling her out .
not_available Carrie ?
not_available Is it essential , entirely ?
not_available Yeah , it is .
not_available Here you go .
not_available So that's it ?
not_available She'll be fine by what , morning ?
not_available No .
not_available It takes time .
not_available Days .
not_available Maybe a week .
not_available Oh , that long ?
not_available And someone needs to watch her while she's evening out .
not_available Full time ?
not_available Or we put her in the psych ward .
not_available Well , that would kill her security clearance forever .
not_available That's why I treat her .
not_available Well I got to get back to work .
not_available I can stay till 7:00 .
not_available Can you take the night shift ?
not_available Well , what do I have to do ?
not_available Just be with her .
not_available Keep her out of trouble .
not_available Okay .
not_available 7:00 .
not_available Welcome to my goddamn humble abode .
not_available Want to tell me where we stand ?
not_available We've been coordinating security with your secret service detail .
not_available Well , I've been in here for eight hours .
not_available At present , the threat The threat is one fucking guy .
not_available Marine sniper , sir , highly trained .
not_available Do you see where I am ?
not_available Do you ?
not_available I'm underground cowering out of sight , at a time when I need to be highly visible .
not_available I'm announcing my candidacy next week for President of the United States .
not_available You may need to push that back , sir .
not_available I'm not going to push that back
not_available Sorry
not_available I am not going to push that back .
not_available That date is set .
not_available And I'm not going to do it from here .
not_available Vote for the fucking cave dweller just because you can't locate Tom Walker .
not_available Yes , sir .
not_available So fix it .
not_available Sir , there's something you should know .
not_available What's that ?
not_available The C4 used in the explosion we sourced it to a Saudi shipment .
not_available Oh It was delivered last year to Prince Sultan Air Base .
not_available Part of a large arms deal that came in Why do you do this ?
not_available What's that , sir ?
not_available Tell me things I don't want to hear .
not_available We've got two Muslims dead in a mosque , an explosion in the streets of D.C .
not_available and Walker who the fuck knows where ?
not_available You want your portrait up on the walls at Langley someday ?
not_available Focus on that .
not_available Find Walker .
not_available Yes , sir .
not_available And fire someone .
not_available I don't care who .
CHRIS That's it ?
BRODY Yep .
not_available That's it .
CHRIS Can we go now ?
CHRIS Only if you can tell me what happened here .
not_available Battle of Gettysburg .
not_available Can you be more specific ?
not_available Four score
not_available and I didn't know I'd be tested .
not_available Okay , we're in Pennsylvania , right ?
not_available Was that the South or the North ?
not_available God .
not_available North .
not_available That's right .
not_available General Lee had brought the war to the North .
not_available The South was winning .
not_available The Northern forces were outnumbered , and they were on the run .
not_available Then they dug in there .
not_available All along that ridge .
not_available General Meade , the Northern general , he drew a line out there and he gave instructions to his troops to defend it at all costs .
not_available And that means with your life .
not_available What happened ?
not_available They prayed .
not_available Both sides did .
not_available These were extremely religious people .
not_available I meant what happened with the fighting ?
not_available Well , imagine You're bone tired , you're cut off from water .
not_available The most crucial part of the line that must be held it's right up there .
not_available You see up there , that little hill ?
not_available It's Little Round Top .
not_available There are just 300 of you .
not_available You're commanded by a school teacher from Maine .
not_available When suddenly , 2,000 enemy soldiers come charging out of those trees , screaming at the top of their lungs , determined to cut you down .
not_available Did they ?
not_available They charged twice .
not_available And then a third time .
not_available And that's when this teacher from Maine Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain was
not_available his name asked his men to do a very strange thing .
not_available What ?
not_available He told them to stop shooting .
not_available No guns , just bayonets .
not_available And instead of shooting they charged down the side of that hill toward the enemy .
not_available And it was so unexpected , it was so crazy , that the line was held that day .
not_available All because of a school teacher from Maine , who was willing to do what was necessary for a cause that he believed in .
not_available Saul .
not_available Where've you been ?
not_available You told me to get Carrie , remember ?
not_available Where is she ?
not_available Keeping her another day .
not_available Perfect .
not_available Hey , David .
not_available She said something interesting .
not_available Of course she did .
not_available Sniper attack that doesn't make sense for Abu Nazir .
not_available It's not his methodology .
not_available Well , maybe it is when he has a military sniper working for him .
not_available She thinks something bigger .
not_available Marine One all over the wire .
not_available New references to Marine Two .
not_available The two leaders of the free world aren't fancy enough targets for you ?
not_available She says it's a sideshow .
not_available If she wants to get her ass in to work
not_available I'll be happy to bat that around with her .
not_available Right .
not_available And it better be soon , because the Vice President's about to fire us all .
not_available She just got blown up , David .
not_available Might not be tomorrow .
not_available Why , what's the problem ?
not_available Doctor's orders .
not_available Dad .
not_available Yeah ?
not_available You
not_available okay ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Yeah , I was just thinking .
not_available Where'd your mom go ?
not_available Gift shop with Chris .
not_available I had no idea that you knew so much .
not_available About Gettysburg ?
not_available About anything .
not_available I mean , I know you're a Marine and all , and I shouldn't be surprised .
not_available Anyway , I get why you wanted to come here .
not_available Can you promise me something ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available What ?
not_available I have this feeling that things are going to get pretty wild soon .
not_available Geez , Dad , it's just a campaign .
not_available Your mom's going to need you .
not_available When I'm not around .
not_available Promise me you'll watch out for her .

not_available No , no , something big is happening .
not_available Something dangerous .

not_available The switch is here .
not_available Under this cover .
not_available Wait until the last second before you open it .
not_available Some people get nervous .
not_available You don't want your hand on the switch until the end .
not_available I read that part of the blast goes upward .
not_available Toward here .
not_available Point of weakness .
not_available So that the head is cleanly severed , and normally found intact .
not_available Everything else isn't .
not_available La ilaha illa Allah .

not_available Yes !
not_available It's Abu Nazir's activities .
not_available Were you up all night ?
not_available More or less .
not_available The fallow yellow .
not_available He went quiet for months .
not_available No videos , no meetings .
not_available But then ?
not_available He came to life again with purpose .
not_available More than ever .
not_available But why the hibernation ?
not_available What happened ?
not_available Injury ?

not_available And then green was revenge .
not_available It was a plan .

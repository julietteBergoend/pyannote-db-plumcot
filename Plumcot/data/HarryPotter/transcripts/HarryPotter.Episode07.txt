not_available Dark Mark
not_available Hermione, tea is ready, Darling
not_available I'm coming, Mom!
not_available C'Mon Dudley hurry up
not_available I still don't understand
not_available why we have to leave?.
not_available Because its
not_available not safe around here anymore
not_available Ron?
not_available evening is finished.
not_available Obliviate.
not_available Severus, I was beginning to worry
not_available you'd lost your way...
not_available ...Come, we have saved you a seat
not_available You bring news, I trust
not_available It will happen next Saturday.
not_available At nightfall
not_available I've heard differently
not_available my lord.
not_available Dawlish, the auror has let slip
not_available that the Potter boy will not be moved
not_available until the 30th of this month.
not_available The day before he turns 17
not_available This is a false trail
not_available The auror office no longer plays any part
not_available in the protection of Harry Potter.
not_available Those closest to him think
not_available that we have infiltrated the Ministry.
not_available Well, they got that right., didn't they ?
lord_voldemort What say you, Pius?
pius_thicknesse One hears many things, my Lord. Which among them is the truth is not clear.
lord_voldemort Ha! Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.
lord_voldemort Where will he be taken, the boy?
professor_severus_snape To a safe house. Most likely the home of someone in the Order. I've been told he's been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him.
bellatrix_lestrange My Lord, I'd like to volunteer for this task. I want to kill the boy.
lord_voldemort Wormtail! Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?
wormtail Yes, my Lord. Right away, my Lord.
lord_voldemort As inspiring as I find your bloodlust Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.
not_available But I face an
not_available unfortunate complication.
not_available My wand and the Potters
not_available share the same core.
not_available They are, someways, twins.
not_available We can wound but not
not_available fatally harm one another.
not_available If I am to kill him ...
not_available ... must do it with
not_available anothers wand
not_available Well, surely one of you
not_available would like the honor
not_available What about you, Lucius?
lucius_malfoy My Lord?
lord_voldemort My Lord?
not_available I require your wand.
not_available Do I detect elm?
not_available Yes, my Lord.
not_available And the core?
not_available Dragon heartstring my lord
not_available Dragon heartstringt?
not_available To those of you who do not know ...
not_available ...we are joined here tonight
not_available by Miss Charity Burbage ...
not_available ... who until recently taught
not_available at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry
not_available Her speciality was muggle studies
not_available It is Miss Burbage's belief that
not_available Muggles are not so different. than us
not_available She would given her way ...
not_available ... have us mate with them.
not_available To her the mixture of magical and
not_available Muggle blood is not an abomination ...
not_available ... but something,
not_available to be encouraged.
not_available Severus.
charity_burbage Severus, please! We were friends...
lord_voldemort Avada Kedavra!
lord_voldemort Nagini... dinner.
not_available Hello Harry!
not_available Hi!
not_available Hi!
not_available You're looking fit.
not_available Yeah, he is absolutely gorgeous...
not_available Lets say we get undercover,
not_available before someone blows you..
not_available Do you?
not_available Kingsley, weren't you looking
not_available after the PrimeMinister?
not_available You are more important.
not_available Hello Harry. Bill Weasley.
not_available Pleasure to meet you.
not_available He wasn't always so handsome
not_available Daredevil.
not_available True enough
not_available Happened while fighting a werewolf called Greyback
not_available I Would like to return the favour one day
not_available You're still beautiful to me, Billy.
not_available Just remember, Fleur
not_available Bill takes his steak on the raw side now
not_available My husband the joker.
not_available By the way,
not_available Wait till you hear the news...
not_available Can't wait no time for cozy catch up.
not_available We have to get the hell out of here.
alastor_moody Potter, you're underage. Which means you still have the trace on you.
harry_potter What's the trace?
alastor_moody If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose. Point is we'll have to use those means of transport the trace can't detect. Brooms, thestrals, anf the like. We'll go in pairs, that way if anyones out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will be, they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.
harry_potter The real one?
alastor_moody I believe you're familiar with this particular brew.
harry_potter No, absolutely not.
hermione_granger Told you he'd take it well.
not_available No, if you think that I'll let,
not_available everyone risk their lives for me ...
not_available Have done if before, haven't we.
not_available No, no, this is different.
not_available Taking that becoming me.
not_available No!
not_available Well none of us really
not_available fancy it mate
not_available Yes, imagine if something went wrong,
not_available and we be stuck as scrawny specky gits forever
not_available Everyone here is of age, Potter.
not_available They all agreed to take the risk.
not_available Technically I'd been coerced
not_available Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. Aways been a huge admirer.
not_available Nip it, Mundungus.
not_available Alright Granger its discussed
not_available Blimey, Hermione!
not_available Put it in there, please.
alastor_moody For those of you who haven't taken
alastor_moody polyjuice potion before,
alastor_moody Fair warning, it tastes like goblin piss.
fred_weasley Have lots of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye?
fred_weasley Just trying to diffuse the tension.
fred_weasley@george_weasley Wow! we are identical!
not_available Not yet you are not.
not_available Haven't you got something a bit more sporting?
not_available Yeah I don't really fancy this color.
not_available Well fancy this , you are not you
not_available so shove it up and strip
not_available Alright, Alright
not_available You too, Potter.
fleur_delacour Bill, look away, I'm hideous.
not_available Ginny did lie about that tattoo.
hermione_granger Harry, your eyesight really is aweful.
not_available Well,we will be pairing off.
not_available Everyone will have a protector.
not_available Mundungus, stick tight to me.
not_available I want to keep an eye on you
not_available As for Harry ...
not_available Yes?
not_available The real Harry.
not_available Where the devil are you anyway?
not_available Here.
not_available You ride with Hagrid.
not_available I brough you here 16 years ago,
not_available when you were no bigger than a bowtruckle.
not_available Seems only right that
not_available I should be the one that takes you away.
not_available Yes this is all very touching.
not_available Lets go !
not_available Head for the Burrow.
not_available We rendezvous you there.
not_available On the count of three!
not_available Hold tight, Harry!
not_available One!
not_available Two!
not_available Three!
not_available Help!
not_available Hagrid, we have to help the others!
not_available We can't do that, Harry
not_available Mad
not_available Eye's orders.
not_available Hang on!
not_available Stupefy!
not_available Hang on, Harry!
not_available Hagrid!
not_available No! No!
not_available Harry!
not_available Hagrid! Hagrid!
not_available What happened?
not_available Where are the others?
not_available Is noone else back?
not_available They were on to us
not_available way from the start, Molly.
not_available We didn't stand a chance.
not_available Well, thank goodness
not_available you two are allright
not_available Death Eaters were waiting
not_available for us. Attacked us.
not_available George and Ron
not_available should have been back.
not_available A dad with Fred too.
not_available Here.
not_available Quick.
not_available Into the house.
not_available Oh My boy ...
not_available Come here!
not_available What are you doing?
not_available What creature sat in the corner the first time when
not_available Harry Potter visited of my office in Hogwarts.
not_available Are you mad?
not_available What creature?
not_available A Grindylow.
not_available We have been betrayed .
not_available Voldemort knew
not_available you were being moved tonight.
not_available I had to make sure,
not_available you were not an imposter.
not_available Wait!
kingsley_shacklebolt The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us.
remus_lupin "Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him."
not_available What gave you away?
not_available Hedwig i think.
not_available She was trying to protect me.
not_available Thanks.
nymphadora_tonks Deserves that. Brilliant, he was. Wouldn't be standing here without him.
hermione_granger Really?
ron_weasley Why is it so surprising ?
not_available We are the last back?.
not_available Where's George?
fred_weasley How you feeling, Georgie?
george_weasley ...Saint-like.
fred_weasley ...Come again?
george_weasley Saint-like.
george_weasley I'm holey.
fred_weasley Pathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-related humor before you, you go for "holey"?
not_available Pathetic.
not_available I'm still better looking than you.
not_available Mad
not_available Eye is dead.
not_available Mundungus took one look at Voldemort
not_available and disapparated.
not_available head for the burrow
not_available Seven. Seven.
not_available This is more than I ever imagined.
not_available Horcruxes ...
not_available They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they.
not_available to tear the soul
not_available into seven pieces ...
not_available If we destroy each Horcruxes ...
not_available One destroys Voldemort.
not_available Harry ...
not_available Trust me.
not_available Do not lie to me. Do not lie to me.
not_available Not
ron_weasley Going somewhere?
harry_potter No one else is going to die. Not for me.
ron_weasley For you? You think Mad-Eye died for you? You think George took that curse for you? You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that.
not_available Come with me.
not_available And leave Hermione?
not_available Are you mad.
ron_weasley We wouldn't last two days without her.
ron_weasley Don't tell her I said that.
not_available Besides you still have the trace on you,
not_available you still got the wedding ...
not_available ... the wedding ...
not_available I don't care about a wedding.
not_available I'm Sorry, no matter whose it is.
not_available I have to start finding these Horcruxes?.
not_available They are our only chance,
not_available to beat him.
not_available And the longer we stay here,
not_available the stronger he gets.
not_available Try and understand me
not_available You will only be doing him a favor.
not_available Do you think he knows?
not_available I mean they are bits of his soul,
not_available the Horcruxes.
not_available Pieces of him.
not_available When Dumbledore destroyed the Ring ...
not_available ... and you destroyed
not_available Tom Riddle's Diary.
not_available He must have felt something?.
not_available To kill thei other Horcruxes,
not_available we have to find them?.
not_available Where are they?
not_available Where do we start?
not_available Zip me up, will you ?
ginny_weasley Seems silly, doesn't it? A wedding. Given everything that's going on.
harry_potter Maybe that's the best reason to have it. Because of everything that's going on.
not_available Morning.
not_available All together now!
not_available One! Two! Three!
not_available How it it going?
not_available Great.
not_available Well, hell.
not_available What is the Minister of Magic doing here?
not_available To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?
not_available I think we both know the answer
not_available to that question, Mr. Potter.
not_available Herein is is said forth
not_available ...?
not_available the last will and testament of ...
not_available ... Albus Percival Wulfric
not_available Brian Dumbledore.
not_available First, to
not_available Ronald Billius Weasley ... "
not_available "... I leave my delumin�tor."
not_available "A device, of my own making ..."
not_available "... In hope when things
not_available seem most dark ... "
not_available "... it will show you the light."
not_available Dumbledore left this for me?
not_available Yes.
not_available Really.
not_available What is it?
not_available Super.
not_available " To Hermione Jean Granger ..."
not_available "... I leave my copy of
not_available Tales of Beedle the Bard ..."
not_available "... In the hope that she finds it
not_available entertaining and instructive "
ron_weasley Mum used to read those to me as a kid! "The Wizard and the Hopping Pot," "Babbity Rabbity And Her Cackling Stump"...
ron_weasley Come on! Babitty Rabbity... No?
not_available "To Harry James Potter ..."
not_available "... I leave the snitch he caught
not_available in his first match at Hogwarts... "
not_available "... As a reminder of
not_available rewards of perseverance ... "
not_available "... And skill."
not_available Is that it then?
not_available Not quite.
not_available Dumbledore left you ...
not_available ... a second bequest
not_available The sword of
not_available Godric Gryffindor.
not_available Unfortunately the sword of Gryffindor
not_available was not Dumbledore's to give away.
not_available As an important
not_available historical artifact it belongs ...
not_available to Harry.
not_available It belongs to Harry.
not_available It came to him when he most
not_available needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.
not_available The sword may present itself to
not_available any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger ...
not_available ... but that does not make it
not_available that wizards property
not_available Unfortunately the current
not_available whereabout of the sword are unknown.
not_available Excuse me?
not_available The Sword is Missing.
not_available I don't know what you are up,
not_available to, Mr. Potter ...
not_available ... but you can't fight
not_available this war on your own
not_available He is too strong.
luna_lovegood Hello, Harry! Oh, I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I? I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.
harry_potter No, of course not. How are you, Luna?
luna_lovegood Very well. I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago.
xenophilius_lovegood Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial! Xenophilius Lovegood.
xenophilius_lovegood We live just over the hill!
harry_potter Very nice to meet you, sir.
xenophilius_lovegood I trust you to know, Mr. Potter, that we at the Quibbler, unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during his lifetime, and his death support you as fully.
luna_lovegood Come, Daddy. Harry doesn't wanna talk to us right now. He's just too polite to say so.
not_available Harry Potter ...
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available May I sit down?
not_available Mr. Potter.
not_available By all means...here
not_available I found what you wrote
not_available in the Daily Prophet.
not_available really moving.
not_available You obviously knew
not_available Dumbledore well.
not_available Well, I certainly
not_available knew him the longest.
not_available Unless we count his brother Aberforth,
not_available and somehow people never do seem to count Aberforth.
not_available I didn't even know
not_available he had a brother.
not_available Ah Well, Dumbledore was always
not_available very private, even as a boy.
not_available Do not despair, Elphias.
not_available I'm told he has been thoroughly
not_available unrevealed by Rita Skeeter.
not_available in 800 pages.
not_available Word has it
not_available that someone talked to her.
not_available Someone who knew the
not_available Dumbledore family well.
not_available Both you and I know
not_available who that is , Elphias.
not_available Monstrous betrayal.
not_available Who are we talking about?
not_available Bathilda Bagshot.
not_available Who?
not_available Oh, boy ...
not_available ... she's only the most celebrated
not_available magical historian of the last century.
not_available She was as close to Dumbledore
not_available as anyone
not_available Sure Rita Skeeter thought it well
not_available worth a trip to Godric's Hollow ...
not_available ... to take a peek into
not_available that old birds records.
not_available Godris Hollow?
not_available Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?
not_available Thats where she first met Dumbledore.
not_available You don't say thar he lived there too.
not_available His family moved
not_available there ...
not_available ... after his father killed
not_available those three Muggles.
not_available It was a quite the scandal.
not_available Honestly my boy ...
not_available ... are you sure
not_available that you knew him at all?
not_available Ministry has fallen.
not_available Minister of Magic is dead.
not_available They are coming.
not_available They are coming.
not_available Nice meeting you,
not_available Mr. Potter.
not_available Ginny!
not_available Go! Go!
not_available Where are we?
not_available Shaftesbury Avenue.
not_available I used to come up here to theaters
not_available with mom and dad.
not_available I do not know why I though of it. It was
not_available the first thing to come to my head
not_available This way.
not_available Have you ever seen this before?
not_available Kreacher?
not_available It is Master Regulus's locket!
not_available There were two, weren't there?
not_available Where is the other one?
not_available Kreacher doesn't know
not_available about the other locket.
not_available Yes, but did you ever see it?
not_available It was in this house.
not_available Flithy mudblood...bloodtraitor Weasley!
not_available Answer her.
not_available Yes It was here, in this house.
not_available Most evil object.
not_available What do you mean?
not_available Before Master. Regulus died ...
not_available ... he ordered Kreacher to destroy the locket,
not_available but no matter how hard Kreacher tried,
not_available he could not do it.
not_available Well, where is it now?
not_available Did someone take it?
not_available He came in the night.
not_available He took many things
not_available including the locket.
not_available Who?
not_available Who was it, Kreacher?
not_available Mundungus.
not_available Mundungus Fletcher.
not_available Find him.
cormac_mclaggen My father *will* hear about this.
neville_longbottom Hey, losers. He isn't here.
not_available As your new Minister of Magic ...
not_available ... I promise to restore this temple
not_available of tolerance to its former glory.
not_available MAGIC IS MIGHT
not_available Therefore beginning today ...
not_available ... each employee will submit
not_available themselves... to evaluation
not_available .
not_available But know this, that you
not_available have nothing to fear...
not_available ... if you have nothing to hide.
not_available They have flesh memories.
not_available When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,
not_available I thought, that it might open at to your touch.
not_available Dumbledore could have
not_available hidden something inside it.
not_available Harry Potter!
not_available Zlezte of me!
not_available Expelliarmus
not_available What are you playing at?
not_available Setting a pair of bleeding
not_available elf on me?
not_available Dobby was only trying to help.
not_available Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley ...
not_available ... which Dobby thought was curious and then
not_available Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name.
not_available And then Dobby saw Kreacher
not_available talking with the thief.
not_available Me a thief ?
not_available You foul little ...
not_available You're a thief, Dung, everyone knows it.
not_available Mr. Weasley.
not_available So good to see you.
not_available Nice shoes.
not_available Listen.
not_available I panicked, alright?
not_available He was right on me and
not_available Mad
not_available Eye fell off his broom
not_available You ...
not_available Tell the truth.
not_available When you turned this place over, don't deny it
not_available You found a locket am I right?
not_available Boy, was it valuable?
not_available Bleeding gave it away, didn't I ?
not_available There I was selling my goods ...
not_available ... when some Ministry hag comes up
not_available and asks to see my license.
not_available she says
not_available she would lock me up?.
not_available Would have done too if she
not_available didn't take a fancy to that locket.
not_available Who was it?
not_available The witch, do you know her?
not_available No ...
not_available Oh ! She's there.
not_available Look.
not_available Its that old hag
not_available MINISTRY SEEKS
not_available EDUCATIONAL REFORM
not_available Right
not_available Remember what we said.
not_available Don't speak to anybody,
not_available Unless it is absolutely necessary.
not_available Just ...
not_available Try and act normal.
not_available Do what everybody
not_available else is doing.
not_available Do that and with a bit of luck
not_available we'll get inside.
not_available And then ...
not_available It gets really tricky.
not_available Right.
harry_potter This is mental.
hermione_granger Completely mental.
ron_weasley The world's mental.
not_available Come on.
not_available We have a Horcrux to find.
ron_weasley We have to flush ourselves in!
ron_weasley That's disgusting.
not_available Are those ...?
not_available Muggles.
not_available In there ... rightful place.
not_available Let me tell you
not_available stop to freak out a bit.
not_available How long did you say
not_available this polyjuice potion will last, Hermione?
not_available I didn't.
death_eater_yaxley Cattermole! It's still raining inside my office!
ron_weasley Uh... have you tried an umbrella?
not_available You realize i'm going downstairs
not_available don't you, Cattermole?
not_available Downstairs?
not_available To interrogate your wife.
not_available Now if my wife's
not_available blood status were in doubt ...
not_available ... and the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement
not_available needed a job doing ...
not_available ... I think I might just
not_available make that a priority
not_available You have one hour.
ron_weasley Oh my God. What am I gonna do? My wife's all alone downstairs!
harry_potter Ron, you don't have a wife.
ron_weasley Oh Right.
not_available Level 2
not_available How do I stop it raining
not_available Try Finite Incantatem.
not_available This is you, Ron.
not_available Finite Incantatem.
not_available Okay.

not_available I say if don't locate Umbridge within the hour,
not_available we find Ron and come back another day.

mary_cattermole Yes?
dolores_umbridge A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole. Is this that wand?
dolores_umbridge Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand?
mary_cattermole But I didn't take it. I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's when I was eleven. It chose me.
dolores_umbridge You're lying.
dolores_umbridge Wands only choose witches, and you are not a witch.
mary_cattermole But I am!
mary_cattermole Tell them, Reg, tell them what I am! Reg, tell them what I am!

not_available Who found Gregorovitch.
not_available This Wand Maker?
not_available He wants something that Gregorovitch used to have.
not_available I do not know what.
not_available But he wants it desperately.
not_available As if his life depended on it
not_available .
not_available Don't, its his comfort zone.
not_available ?
not_available It sets my teeth on edge,,
not_available Whats he expecting to hear? Good news?
not_available One can only hope
not_available not to hear bad news.
not_available How long before he can travel?
not_available I'm doing everyting I can.
not_available You are not doing enough?
not_available Take it off!
not_available I said,
not_available Take it off, now!
not_available Better?
not_available Right .
not_available We will take in turns, okay?
not_available What is that?
not_available Snatchers.
not_available Good to know,
not_available that your enchantments work.
not_available He could smell it.
not_available my perfume.
not_available I told you
not_available Ron is not strong enough to apparate.
not_available So we will go on foot then.
not_available Only next time, even when I like
not_available your perfume, do not use it.
not_available The names of missing...
not_available .
not_available These are confirmed.
not_available Oh, thank you.
not_available He doesn't know what he is doing? does he?
not_available None of us do.
hermione_granger Oh my God...
harry_potter What?
hermione_granger I'll tell you in a minute.
harry_potter How about you tell me now?
hermione_granger Alright. The Sword of Gryffindor. It's Goblin-made.
harry_potter Brilliant!
not_available No, you don't understand.
not_available Dirt and dust
not_available have no effect on the blade.
not_available It only takes in that
not_available which makes it stronger.
not_available Okay ...
not_available we are looking for a way to destroy horcrux , right ?
not_available Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets.
not_available With a basilisk.fang
not_available If you tell me you got ,
not_available one of those in that bloody beeded bag of yours ...
not_available Don't you see? In The Chamber of Secrets
not_available you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor
not_available Its blade is impregnated with
not_available basilisk venom.
not_available It only takes in that
not_available which makes it stronger
not_available Exactly, which is why
not_available It can destroy Horcruxes.
not_available Thats why Dumbledore
not_available left it to you in his will.
not_available You're brilliant, Hermione.
not_available Truely.
hermione_granger Actually I'm highly logical which allows me to look past extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.
not_available Yeah, there is only one problem.
not_available Someone stole the sword.
not_available Hey, I'm still here.
not_available You two carry on.
not_available Don't let me spoil the fun.
not_available I told you everything
not_available that Dumbledore told me!
not_available Incase you haven't noticed
not_available We have found one Horcrux already.
not_available Yes, and we are as close to getting rid
not_available of it as we are to finding the rest, aren't we?
not_available Ron, Please, take off the Horcrux ...
not_available you wouldn't have spoken like this
not_available if you hadn't wore it all day
ron_weasley You don't know why I listen to the radio, do you? To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name. Or Fred, or George, or Mum.
harry_potter You think I'm not listening too? You think I don't know how this feels?
ron_weasley No, you *don't* know how it feels! Your parents are dead! You have no family!
hermione_granger Stop!
harry_potter Fine then, go! Go then! Leave the locket.
hermione_granger Ron...
ron_weasley And you? Are you coming or are you staying?
ron_weasley Fine. I get it. I saw you two the other night.
hermione_granger Ron, that's - that's nothing!
not_available Ron!
not_available Ron, where are you going?
not_available Come back, now!
not_available Salvia Hexi
not_available I opens at the close
not_available Hermione?
not_available Hermione?
not_available You were right.
not_available Snithced have flesh memory ...
not_available ... but I did not catch the first snitch with my hand.
not_available I almost swallowed it.
not_available "I open at the close."
not_available What do you think that means?
not_available I don't know.
not_available I found something as well
not_available At first I thought it was an eye
not_available it's eye, but now I don't think it is.
not_available And it's no rune,
not_available it is anywhere in Spellmans syllabury.
not_available Someone wrote it there.
not_available Somebody inked it in
not_available it isn't part of the book
not_available Luna's dad was wearing that at
not_available the wedding of Bill and Fleur.
not_available Why would someone draw
not_available it in a childrens book?
not_available Hermione, I've been thinking
not_available I want to go to Godric's Hollow
not_available Its where I was born ,
not_available Its where my parents died.
not_available Thats exactly why they'll expect you to go
not_available it means something to you
not_available But it means something to
not_available him too, Hermione.
not_available YouKnow
not_available Who almost died there.
not_available Isn't that exactly the type of place
not_available he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?
not_available It is dangerous, Harry.
not_available But I admit it recently I've been thinking
not_available we have to go there
not_available I think its is possible that
not_available something else is hidden there.
not_available What?
not_available The Sword.
not_available If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,
not_available and to not let it fall into the hands of the Ministry ...
not_available ... what better place to hide it
not_available than the birthplace of founder of Gryffindor
not_available Hermione ...
not_available Don't tell me I have to give
not_available you a haircut again
hermione_granger I still think we should have used Polyjuice Potion.
harry_potter No. This is where I was born. I'm not returning as someone else.
not_available Harry, I think it is Christmas eve.
not_available Listen.
not_available Do you think they are here, Hermione?
not_available My mom and dad.
not_available I think so.
not_available Ignotus Peverell.
not_available Hey, Harry?
harry_potter Merry Christmas, Hermione.
hermione_granger Merry Christmas, Harry.
not_available Harry, someone is watching us.
not_available Near the church.
not_available I think I know who it is.
not_available I don't know this, Harry.
not_available Hermione, Dumbledore knew.
not_available She might have the sword.
not_available This is where they died, Hermione.
not_available This is where he murdered them.
not_available Bathilda, aren't you ?
not_available Leave it, let me do that.
not_available Miss Bagshot,
not_available Who is this man?
not_available Harry!
not_available Are you feeling better?
not_available This time can be overcome,
not_available Hermione.
not_available Forest of Dean.
not_available I came here once with my mother and father.
not_available Years ago.
not_available Its just
not_available how I remember it.
not_available Trees, the river, everything.
not_available Like nothings changed.
not_available This of course is true,
not_available everything has changed.
not_available If there were my parents,
not_available they would have nothing nepam�tali.
not_available Or trees.
not_available Or river.
not_available Not even me.
not_available Perhaps we should
not_available stay here, Harry.
not_available Grow old?.
not_available You wanted to know
not_available Who was the boy in the photograph was.
not_available I know.
not_available Gellert Grindelwald.
not_available He's the thief I saw
not_available in Gregorovitch's wandshop.
not_available Speaking of which
not_available where's my wand?
not_available Where's my wand, Hermione?
not_available As we were leaving Godrics Hollow I cast a curse.
not_available and it rebounded
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I tried to mend it,
not_available But wands are different.
not_available Its nothing.
not_available Lend me yours.
not_available Go inside and get warm.
not_available I'll take the locket as well.

not_available Hermione?
ron_weasley Are you mental?
not_available Ron, is that you?
not_available Yes.
not_available Didn't hurt yourself did you ?
not_available You cast the doe as well did you?
not_available No, I thought that was you.
not_available No, my Patronus is a stag.
not_available Clear.
not_available Okay, Ron.
not_available Do it.
not_available I can not. The thing affect me more
not_available as you and Hermione.
not_available All the more reason
not_available I can not.
not_available then why are you here?
not_available Why did you come back?
not_available I'll have to speak to it to open it
not_available When it does, don't hesitate.
not_available I don't know whats in there, but it will put up a fight?.
not_available The bit of Riddle in the diary was trying to kill me?.
not_available One.
not_available Two.
not_available Three.
tom_marvolo_riddle I have seen your heart and it is mine. I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears...
harry_potter Ron! Don't listen to it!
tom_marvolo_riddle Least loved by the mother who craved a daughter. Least loved, by the girl who prefers your friend...
harry_potter Ron! Stab it!
tom_marvolo_riddle We were better without you, happier without you.
tom_marvolo_riddle Who could look at you beside Harry Potter? What are you, compared to the Chosen One...?
harry_potter Ron! It lies! Stab it! STAB IT!
tom_marvolo_riddle Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son...
tom_marvolo_riddle Who wouldn't prefer him? What woman would take you? You are nothing... nothing... nothing to him...
ron_weasley NOOO!
ron_weasley Just think... only three to go.
not_available Hermione?
not_available Hermione?
not_available Is everything alright?
not_available Fine...
not_available Actually its more than fine.
ron_weasley Hey!
hermione_granger You...
hermione_granger Complete...
hermione_granger *Arse*, Ronald Weasley! You show up here after weeks, and you say 'Hey'?
hermione_granger Where's my wand, Harry? Where's my wand?
harry_potter I don't know!
hermione_granger Harry Potter, you give me my wand!
not_available I don't know.
not_available Harry Potter
not_available You give me my wand!
not_available What happened to your wand?
not_available Nevermind he's got my wand.
not_available What is that?
not_available You destroyed it.
not_available And how is it that you just happened to have the
not_available sword of Gryffindor ?
not_available It's a long story.
not_available Don't think
not_available it changes anything.
not_available Of course not. I only destroyed a
not_available bloody Horcrux, why will that change anything.
not_available I wanted to come back
not_available as soon as I left.
not_available just didn't know how to find you
harry_potter How did you find us?
ron_weasley With this. It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know how it works, but Christmas morning, I was sleeping in this little pub, keeping away from some Snatchers, and I heard it.
harry_potter "It"?
ron_weasley A voice. Your voice, Hermione. Coming out of it.
hermione_granger And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
ron_weasley My name. Just my name. Like a whisper. So I took it, clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew. And sure enough, it floated towards me, the ball of light, right through my chest and straight through me. Right here
ron_weasley And I knew it was going to take me where I needed to go.
not_available so I disapparated
not_available came to this hillside
not_available It was dark, I had
not_available no idea where I was.
not_available I just hoped
not_available One of you will show yourself
not_available you did
ron_weasley I've always liked these flames Hermione makes.
ron_weasley How long do you reckon she'll stay mad at me?
harry_potter Well, just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart, and she'll come 'round.
ron_weasley It was true, every word. This is gonna sound crazy, but I think that's why Dumbledore left it to me, the Deluminator. I think he knew that somehow I'd need it to find my way back, and she'd lead me.
not_available Hey, I just realized
not_available you need a wand, don't yout?
not_available I got one here.
not_available Blackthorn 10 inches ,
not_available nothing special.
not_available But be uploaded with just.
not_available I took off
not_available a snatcher few weeks ago

not_available Definitely was a troll,
not_available by the smell of it.

not_available Yeah, alright
not_available I want to go see

not_available Sorry?
not_available See this ? It is a letter
not_available Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald.
not_available Look at the signature.
not_available It's the mark again
not_available It keeps cropping up.
not_available in The tales of Beedle the Bard,
not_available in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow ...
not_available it was there too.
not_available Where?
not_available Outside Gregorvitch's wandshop.
not_available What dors it mean?
not_available Look...
not_available You have no idea where the next Horcrux is
not_available , and neither I do
not_available But this,
not_available this means something.
not_available I am sure of it.
not_available Yeah. Hermione's right.
not_available We ought to see Lovegood
not_available Lets vote.
not_available Those in favor.
harry_potter You're not still mad at him, are you?
hermione_granger I'm always mad at him.

not_available Dirigible Plums.
not_available What is it?
not_available Who are you?
not_available What do you want?
not_available Hello, Mr. Lovegood.
not_available I'm Harry Potter,
not_available we met a few months ago.
not_available Can we come in?
not_available Where is Luna?
not_available I don't know.
not_available She will be along.
not_available So...how can I
not_available help you, Mr Potter ?
not_available Well, actually ...
not_available ... it was about something that you were wearing
not_available around your neck at the wedding. A symbol.
not_available You mean this?
not_available Yes.
not_available That's it exactly
not_available What I wonder is ...
not_available what is it?
not_available What is it?
not_available Well.. its the sign of
not_available the deathly hallows ofcourse .
not_available The What?
not_available The What?
not_available The Deathly Hallows. I assume you are all
not_available familiar with the tale of the three brothers?
not_available Yes.
not_available No.
not_available I have it in here.
hermione_granger "There were once three brothers, who were traveling along a lonely winding road at twilight. In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass. But being learned in the magical arts, the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge. Before they could cross, however, they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. It was Death, and he felt cheated, cheated because travelers would normally drown in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers on their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for being clever enough to evade him. The oldest asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence, so Death fashioned one from an elder tree that stood nearby. The second brother decided he wanted to humiliate Death even further, and asked for the power to recall loved ones from the grave. So Death plucked a stone from the river and offered it to him. Finally, Death turned to the third brother. A humble man, he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own cloak of invisibility. The first brother traveled to a distant village, where with the Elder Wand in hand, he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled. Drunk with the power that the Elder Wand had given him, he bragged of his invincibility. But that night, another wizard stole the Wand and slit the brother's throat for good measure. And so Death took the first brother for his own. The second brother journeyed to his home, where he took the Stone and turned it thrice in hand. To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared before him. Yet soon she turned sad and cold, for she did not belong in the living world. Driven mad with hopeless longing, the second brother killed himself so as to join her. And so Death took the second brother. As for the third brother, Death searched for many years, but was never able to find him. Only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his son. He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly, departing this life as equals."
xenophilius_lovegood So there you are. Those are the Deathly Hallows.
not_available I'm sorry sir,
not_available I still don't quite understand.
xenophilius_lovegood The Elder Wand, the most powerful wand ever made.
xenophilius_lovegood The Resurrection Stone.
xenophilius_lovegood The Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one master of death.
not_available That mark was on the grave in
not_available Godrics Hollow.
not_available Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell
not_available family have something to do with
not_available the deathly hallows
not_available Yes, Ignotus, and his brothers
not_available Cadmus and Antioch were the original owner of the hallows ...
not_available ... and therefore inspiration for the story.

harry_potter I can’t let you out, Hedwig. I’m not allowed to use magic
uncle_vernon harry potter!
harry_potter Now you’ve done it.
aunt_petunia He’s in there. Vernon…
uncle_vernon I’m warning you, if you can’t control that bloody bird
harry_potter But she’s bored! If I could only let outonly let out for an hour or two.
uncle_vernon Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!
harry_potter But I haven’t had any messages from any of my friends… not one… all summer.
dudley_dursley Who’d want to be friends with you?
uncle_vernon I should think you’d be a little more grateful. We’ve raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have dudley’s second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
aunt_petunia Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive.
uncle_vernon Which should be any minute! Ahem…Now let’s go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be…?
aunt_petunia …in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home.
uncle_vernon Good! And- and dudley, you will be…?
dudley_dursley I’ll be waiting to open the door!
uncle_vernon Excellent! …And you…?
harry_potter I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don’t exist.
uncle_vernon Too right, you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career. And you will not mess it up!
uncle_vernon Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
dobby Ha- ha- ha! Ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha! harry potter! Such an honor it is!
harry_potter Who are you?
dobby dobby sir, dobby the house elf.
harry_potter Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.
dobby Oh, oh yes, sir! dobby understands! It’s just that, dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- dobby wonders where to begin?
harry_potter Why don’t you sit down?
dobby S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? Oh, oh, ho. Oh, ho, ho… Oh, ho, ho. Ohh, ho, hoo…
harry_potter dobby, ssh! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything.
dobby Offend dobby? dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
harry_potter You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
dobby No, I haven’t. That was an awful thing to say. Bad dobby!
harry_potter Stop, dobby!
dobby Bad dobby!
harry_potter dobby, shh!
dobby Baaad dobby!
harry_potter dobby, please stop!
uncle_vernon Ohh, don’t mind that! It’s just the cat.
dobby Bad dobby. Bad dobby!
harry_potter Stop! Stop, dobby. Please be quiet! Are you all right?
dobby dobby had to punish himself, sir. dobby almost spoke ill of his
harry_potter Your family?
dobby The wizard family dobby serves, sir. dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew dobby was here…ooh… But dobby had to come. dobby has to protect harry potter- to warn him. harry potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.
harry_potter What terrible things? Who’s plotting them?
dobby Ooo… er… can’t… say… argh...
harry_potter Ok– I- understand. You can’t- say.
dobby Don’t make me talk, I— Errr…
harry_potter dobby! dobby, put the lamp down.
dobby Bad dobby.
uncle_vernon So when they arrive at the ninth hole…
harry_potter Give me the lamp! dobby stop!
dobby Let me go!
harry_potter Get in there, and keep quiet!
uncle_vernon What the devil are you doing up here?
harry_potter I- I was just—
uncle_vernon You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke!
harry_potter Sorry.
uncle_vernon One more sound, and you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy! And
harry_potter Yes, sir… See why I’ve got to go back? I don’t belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. It’s the only place I’ve got friends!
dobby Friends who don’t even write to harry potter?
harry_potter Well, I expect they’ve… been- hang on- how do you know my friends
dobby harry potter mustn’t be angry with dobby. Heh- dobby hoped, if harry potter thought his friends had forgotten him, harry potter might not want to go back to school, sir.
harry_potter Give me those, now!
dobby No! Ahh! Ooh…
harry_potter dobby, get back here!
dobby
harry_potter dobby, please, no!
dobby harry potter must say he’s not going back to school!
harry_potter I can’t. Hogwarts is my home!
dobby Then, dobby must do it, sir, for harry potter’s own good.
uncle_vernon …it spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this vast building, and it was this deep. And one plumber said “Look at all that water.” A-and the second plumber said, “Yes, and that’s just the top of it!”
dobby
uncle_vernon I’m so sorry! It’s my nephew- he’s very disturbed. Meeting
uncle_vernon You’re never going back to that school. You’re never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!

hagrid He did not!
harry_potter What’s a Mudblood?

hermione_granger The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is,
ron_weasley Let’s think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
hermione_granger If you’re talking about Malfoy.
ron_weasley Of course. You heard him! ‘You’ll be next Mudbloods,’
hermione_granger I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
harry_potter Well, maybe Ron’s right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The
ron_weasley Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
hermione_granger Even they aren’t that thick. But there might be another way. Mind
hermione_granger Here it is. ‘The Polyjuice Potion.’ (Reading from Moste Potente
ron_weasley Do you mean, if harry and I drink that stuff, we’ll turn into Crabbe and

harry_potter What’s bad? If I hadn’t told that snake not to attack Justin.
ron_weasley Oh, that’s what you said to it!
harry_potter You were there! You heard me!
ron_weasley I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?
harry_potter I spoke a different language? But- I didn’t realize I- how can I speak

albus_dumbledore Riddle! Come.

hagrid No!
tom_riddle Cistem aperio! Arania exumai!

tom_riddle I can’t let you go. They’ll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
harry_potter Hagrid! Haagriid!
harry_potter Woah!
harry_potter It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty years ago.
hermione_granger It can’t be Hagrid. It just can’t be.
ron_weasley We don’t even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten
harry_potter The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?
hermione_granger Look. Hagrid’s our friend. Why don’t we just go and ask him about
ron_weasley That’ll be a cheerful visit! “Hello, Hagrid! Tell us, have you been
hagrid Mad and hairy? You wouldn’t be talking about me now, would ya?
harry_potter ron, hermione No!

hagrid Oh, It’s a- Flesh-Eatin’ Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, ya know.
hagrid Hello, Neville!
neville_longbottom harry- I don’t know who did it, but you’d better come! Come on!
hermione_granger It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password- unless
ron_weasley Who ever it was, they must have been looking for something.
harry_potter And they found it. Tom Riddle’s diary is gone.

harry_potter We’ve got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can’t believe it’s him, but if he
ron_weasley But you heard McGonagall! We’re not allowed to leave the tower except
harry_potter I think it’s time to get my Dad’s old cloak out again.
hagrid Who’s there? Hello? Hello?
harry_potter What’s that for?
hagrid Oh, nothing. I- I was expecting, ah… It doesn’t matter- come on inI
harry_potter Hagrid, are you okay?
hagrid I’m fine! I’m alright.
harry_potter Did you hear about Hermione?
hagrid Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all righ’.
harry_potter Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who’s opened the
hagrid What you had to understand about that is— Quick
albus_dumbledore Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we…?
hagrid Of course! Come in! Come in.
ron_weasley That’s Dad’s boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!
cornelius_fudge Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three
hagrid Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!
albus_dumbledore I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full
cornelius_fudge Albus look, Hagrid’s record is against him. I’ve got to take
hagrid Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?
cornelius_fudge I’m afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.
lucius_malfoy Already here, Fudge? Good…
hagrid What’re you doin’ here? Get outta my house!
lucius_malfoy Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your--
albus_dumbledore Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?
lucius_malfoy The other governors and I have decided it’s time for you to
hagrid Yeh can’ take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an’ the
lucius_malfoy You think so?
albus_dumbledore Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I
lucius_malfoy Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!

cornelius_fudge Good boy.
ron_weasley Hagrid’s right! With Dumbledore gone, there’ll be an attack a day!
harry_potter Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!
harry_potter Come on!
ron_weasley What?!
harry_potter You heard what Hagrid said; ‘Follow the spiders.’
ron_weasley They’re headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders! Why couldn’t it be
ron_weasley harry, I don’t like this… harry, I don’t like this at all!
harry_potter Shush!
ron_weasley Can we go back now?
harry_potter Come on!
aragog Who is it?
harry_potter Don’t panic.
aragog Hagrid? Is that you?
harry_potter We’re friends of Hagrid’s. And you? Y- y-you’re Aragog aren’t you?
aragog Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
harry_potter He’s in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think
aragog That’s a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
harry_potter Then you’re not the monster.
aragog No! The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a
ron_weasley harry.
harry_potter Shush. But if you’re not the monster, then- then what did kill that
aragog We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear
harry_potter But have you seen it?
aragog I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept
ron_weasley harry!
harry_potter What?
ron_weasley Ahh- hhh…
harry_potter Well, thank you. We’ll just…go.
aragog Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my
ron_weasley Can we panic now?
ron_weasley Know any spells?
harry_potter One, but it’s not powerful enough for all of them.
ron_weasley Where’s Hermione when you need her?
harry_potter Let’s go! Arania exumai! Go!
harry_potter ron Whoah!
ron_weasley Glad we’re out of there! Ah- Aaaah!
harry_potter Arania exumai!
ron_weasley Thanks for that.
harry_potter Don’t mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move
harry_potter ron Aah!
harry_potter Go on! Go! Get us in the air.
ron_weasley The flying gear’s jammed!
harry_potter Come on! Pull!
ron_weasley I’m trying!
ron_weasley Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of
harry_potter We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was
harry_potter Wish you were here Hermione. We need you… now, more than ever.
ron_weasley What’s that?
harry_potter Ron, this is why Hermione was in the Library the day she was attacked.
harry_potter ‘Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly
ron_weasley But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one’s dead?
harry_potter Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin
ron_weasley And Mrs. Norris? I’m pretty sure she didn’t have a camera or a mirror,
harry_potter The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the
ron_weasley But how’s a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone
harry_potter Hermione’s answered that, too.
ron_weasley Pipes? It’s using the plumbing!
harry_potter Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died
ron_weasley Moaning Myrtle.
gilderoy_lockhart mcgonagall all students are to return to their house dormitories

madam_pomfrey pomfrey Who is it that the monster’s taken, Minerva?
gilderoy_lockhart mcgonagall Ginny Weasley.

harry_potter Lockhart may be useless, but he’s going to try and get into the
harry_potter Professor, we have some information for you! Are you going somewhere?
gilderoy_lockhart Uh, ah- well, yes- um, urgent call- unavoidable- got to
ron_weasley What about my sister?!
gilderoy_lockhart Well, um- as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets
ron_weasley You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can’t go now!
gilderoy_lockhart Well- I must say- when I took the job there was nothing
harry_potter You’re running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
gilderoy_lockhart Books can be misleading!
harry_potter You wrote them!
gilderoy_lockhart My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn’t
harry_potter You’re a fraud! You’ve just been taking credit for what other wizards
ron_weasley Is there anything you can do?
gilderoy_lockhart Yes, now you mention it. I’m rather gifted with Memory
harry_potter Don’t even think about it.
moaning_myrtle myrtle Oh! Who’s there? Oh! Hello, harry! Ron. What do you want?
harry_potter To ask you how you died.
moaning_myrtle myrtle Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very
harry_potter Who was it Myrtle?
moaning_myrtle myrtle I don’t know. I was Distraught! Huhh-huh…But they said
harry_potter Just like that? How?
moaning_myrtle myrtle I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes…over
harry_potter This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the
ron_weasley Say something. harry, say something in Parseltongue!
harry_potter Hesha- Hassah.
gilderoy_lockhart Excellent, harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, I’ll just
harry_potter Oh, yes there is! You first.
gilderoy_lockhart Now, boys what good will it do?
ron_weasley Better you than us.
gilderoy_lockhart Um…but…obviously, yes. Sure you don’t want to test it
harry_potter all right. Let’s go.
moaning_myrtle myrtle Oh, harry? If you die down there, you’re welcome to share my
harry_potter Uh…thanks Myrtle.
harry_potter &amp; ron Aaah!
ron_weasley Ugh!
harry_potter Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway.
ron_weasley Go on.
harry_potter This way.
ron_weasley What’s this?
gilderoy_lockhart It looks like a… snake.
harry_potter It’s a snakeskin.
ron_weasley Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! Heart
gilderoy_lockhart The adventure ends here, boys. But don’t fret. The world
ron_weasley harry! harry!
harry_potter Ron! Ron, are you ok?
ron_weasley I’m fine!
gilderoy_lockhart Uhh… Hello. Who are you?
ron_weasley Um…Ron Weasley.
gilderoy_lockhart Really? And uh, who- who am I?
ron_weasley Lockhart’s memory charm backfired. He hasn’t got a clue who he is!
gilderoy_lockhart It’s an odd sort of place this, isn’t it? Do you live here?
ron_weasley No!
gilderoy_lockhart Really? Well?
ron_weasley What’ll do I do now?
harry_potter You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back
ron_weasley OK.
harry_potter Hesha- Hassah.
harry_potter Ginny… Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don’t be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!
tom_riddle She won’t wake.
harry_potter Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, ‘she won’t wake?’ She’s not…?
tom_riddle She’s still alive, but only just.
harry_potter Are you a ghost?
tom_riddle A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.
harry_potter She’s cold as ice. Ginny, please don’t be dead. Wake up! You’ve got to
tom_riddle It won’t come until it’s called.
harry_potter Give me my wand, Tom.
tom_riddle You won’t be needing it.
harry_potter Listen, we’ve got to go! We’ve got to save her!
tom_riddle I’m afraid I can’t do that, harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows
harry_potter No. She couldn’t. She wouldn’t!
tom_riddle It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch’s
harry_potter But why?
tom_riddle Because I told her to. You’ll find that I can be very persuasive.
harry_potter But, why did you want to meet me?
tom_riddle I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to
harry_potter Hagrid’s my friend! And you framed him, didn’t you?
tom_riddle It was my word against Hagrid’s. Only Dumbledore seemed to think
harry_potter I’ll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
tom_riddle He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I
harry_potter Well, you haven’t finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake
tom_riddle Haven’t I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn’t matter to me
harry_potter Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
tom_riddle Voldemort is my past, present, and future.
harry_potter You! You’re the Heir of Slytherin. You’re Voldemort.
tom_riddle Surely, you didn’t think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle
harry_potter Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
tom_riddle Dumbledore’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of
harry_potter He’ll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him!
tom_riddle So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird
tom_riddle Let’s match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar
tom_riddle No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still
tom_riddle Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes
harry_potter Ginny-
tom_riddle Remarkable isn’t it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk
harry_potter Ginny…
ginny_weasley harry. It was me- but I swear, I didn’t mean to! Riddle made me,
harry_potter Don’t worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber,
gilderoy_lockhart Amazing! This is just like magic!
albus_dumbledore You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have
harry_potter ron Yes, sir.
albus_dumbledore And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
harry_potter ron Yes, sir.
albus_dumbledore Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special
ron_weasley Thanks, sir!
albus_dumbledore And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these
harry_potter It’s just… You see, sir I- I couldn’t help but notice certain
albus_dumbledore I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, harry. Why? Because Lord
harry_potter Voldemort transferred some of his powers… to me?
albus_dumbledore Not intentionally, but yes.
harry_potter So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.
albus_dumbledore It’s true, harry. You possess many of the qualities that
harry_potter Because I asked it to.
albus_dumbledore Exactly, harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from

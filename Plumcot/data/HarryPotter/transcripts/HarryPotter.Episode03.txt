aunt_petunia_dursley Harry! Harry! Harry! Open the door!
aunt_petunia_dursley Marge! Lovely to see you- How was the train?
harry_potter Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign this form.
uncle_vernon_dursley What is it?
harry_potter Nothing. School stuff.
uncle_vernon_dursley Later perhaps, if you behave.
harry_potter I will if she does.
aunt_marge Oh- Still here, are you?
harry_potter Yes.
aunt_marge Don't say 'yes' in that ungrateful way. Good of my brother to keep ya. He'd have been straight into an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep, Vernon.
dudley_dursley Ah-ha-ha-ha... Ah-ha!
aunt_marge Is that my Dudders?! Is that my little neffy-poo? Come give us a kiss. Come on up, up, up! Oh-ho, yes, hmm. That's a good boy!
uncle_vernon_dursley Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
harry_potter Okay.
aunt_marge Now, finish that off for mummy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
uncle_vernon_dursley Can I tempt you, Marge?
aunt_marge Just a small one. Excellent nosh, Petunia. Heh- eh, a bit more. Usually it's just a fry-up for me, what with twelve dogs. A bit more... That's a boy. Umm. Aah. You want to try a little drop of brandy? A little bit 'o brundybrandy-wundy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?... What are you smirking at?
harry_potter 
aunt_marge Where is it you send the boy, Vernon?
uncle_vernon_dursley St. Brutus's. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
aunt_marge Do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?
harry_potter Oh, yeah. Yeah- I've, I've been beaten loads of times. Umm.
aunt_marge Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby, wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it. Heh- But you mustn't blame yourself about how this one's turned out, Vernon. It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out. What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?
aunt_petunia_dursley Nothing. Uh, he did... he didn't work. He was- was- unemployed.
aunt_marge And a drunk, too, no doubt.
harry_potter That's a lie.
aunt_marge What did you say?
harry_potter My dad wasn't a drunk.
aunt_petunia_dursley Oh!
aunt_marge Oh, huh-ha! Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip.
uncle_vernon_dursley I think it's time you went to bed.
aunt_marge Quiet, Vernon. You- clean it up! Actually, it's nothing to do with the father. It's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup...
harry_potter Shut up! Shut up!
aunt_marge Umm. Right. Let me tell you... y- ye...
uncle_vernon_dursley Ohm... umm...
aunt_marge Ah! Ahh! Vernon! Vernon, Vernon, do something!
uncle_vernon_dursley Ow! Ripper! Owww! R- Ripper, get down boy! Get down!
aunt_marge Whoo-ooo-oooh!
uncle_vernon_dursley STOP!
uncle_vernon_dursley I've got you, Marge... I've got you... Ow!
aunt_marge Ah! Ahhh!
uncle_vernon_dursley Hold on... Hold on! Hold on! Get off of there!
aunt_marge Don't you dare –
uncle_vernon_dursley Sorry.
aunt_marge Aaaah!
aunt_petunia_dursley Oh, Vernon! Oh, gosh!
uncle_vernon_dursley Ahhh!
aunt_marge Ahhhh!
uncle_vernon_dursley Please! Marge! Please! Marge!
harry_potter Ugh!
uncle_vernon_dursley You bring her back! You bring her back now and put her right!
harry_potter No! She deserved what she got! And you keep away from me.
uncle_vernon_dursley You're not allowed to do magic outside of school.
harry_potter Yeah? Try me.
uncle_vernon_dursley They won't let you back now. You've nowhere to go.
harry_potter I don't care. Anywhere's better than here.

stan_shunpike Wot did you say your name was again?
harry_potter I didn't.
stan_shunpike Well, whereabouts are you headed'?
harry_potter The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London...
stan_shunpike Do you 'ear that, Ern? 'The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.'
shrunken_head The Leaky Cauldron! Heh- if you have the pea soup, make sure you eat it before it eats you! Ha ha ha ha ha haaaa!
harry_potter But the Muggles? Won't they see us?
stan_shunpike Muggles? They don't see nuthin', do they?
shrunken_head No, but if you stab them with a fork, they feel it! Ha ha ha! Ernie, little old lady at twelve o'clock!
harry_potter Oomf!
shrunken_head Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, three and a half, two, one and three-quarters... yes!
harry_potter Who is that? That man.
stan_shunpike Who is that? Who is- That is Sirius Black, that is. Don' tell me you've ne'er been hearin' o' Sirius Black? He's a murderer. Got 'imself locked up in Azkaban for it.
harry_potter How did he escape?
stan_shunpike Well, tha's the question, isn't it? He's the firs' one that done it. He was a big supporter of... You-Know-'Oo. Reckon you heard of him?
harry_potter Yeah. Him I've heard of.
shrunken_head Ernie, two double-deckers at twelve o'clock. They're getting closer, Ernie. Ernie, they're right on top of us! Mind your head. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, heh! Hey, guys? Guys? Why the long faces? Ha ha ha ha ha! Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there. Nearly there.

shrunken_head next stop Knockturn Alley.
tom_riddle Ahh! Mr. Potter... at last.
stan_shunpike Take 'er away, Ern.
shrunken_head Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
tom_riddle Room eleven.
harry_potter Hedwig!
tom_riddle Right smart bird you've got there, Mr. Potter. He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
cornelius_fudge Eh-hem... As the Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter, that earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. So, that's that... and no harm done. Pea soup?
harry_potter Uh- no thank you. Um, Minister...
cornelius_fudge Yes?
harry_potter I don't understand.
cornelius_fudge Understand?
harry_potter I broke the law. Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home --
cornelius_fudge Oh, come now, Harry. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts!
tom_riddle Huh, huh, huh, huh!
cornelius_fudge On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things, was very, very irresponsible.
harry_potter 'The state of things' sir?
cornelius_fudge We have a killer on the loose.
harry_potter Sirius Black, you mean? But, what's he got to do with me?
cornelius_fudge Uh-hmm? Oh, nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters. And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts. Oh- ah, these are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty of having them brought here for you. Now, Tom will show you to your room.
harry_potter Hedwig.
cornelius_fudge Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here it would be best if you didn't, ah... wander.
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Right! You gonna move that bus, or what?
young_witch#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Housekeeping. I'll come back later.
ron_weasley I'm warning you, Hermione! Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
hermione_granger He's a cat, Ronald! What do you expect? It's in his nature.
ron_weasley A cat! Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair, if you ask me.
hermione_granger That's rich, coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. It's all right, Crookshanks. You just ignore the mean little boy...
ron_weasley Harry!
hermione_granger Harry!
harry_potter Egypt! What's it like?
ron_weasley Brilliant. Loads of old stuff, like mummies, tombs – even Scabbers enjoyed himself!
hermione_granger You know, the Egyptians used to worship cats.
ron_weasley Yeah- along with the dung beetle!
george_weasley Not flashing that clipping about again, are you, Ron?
ron_weasley I haven't shown anyone!
fred_weasley No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom.
george_weasley The day maid.
fred_weasley The night maid.
george_weasley The cook.
fred_weasley That bloke that came to fix the toilet.
george_weasley And that wizard from Belgium...
molly_weasley Harry!
harry_potter Mrs. Weasley.
molly_weasley Good to see you, dear!
harry_potter Good to see you, too.
molly_weasley Now, you've got everything you need?
harry_potter Yep.
molly_weasley Yes? All of your books?
harry_potter Yeah, it's all upstairs.
molly_weasley And all of your clothes?
harry_potter Everything's there.
molly_weasley Good boy.
harry_potter Thank you.
arthur_weasley Harry Potter!
harry_potter Mr. Weasley.
arthur_weasley Harry, I wonder if I might have a word?
harry_potter Yeah, sure.
arthur_weasley Hermione!
hermione_granger Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
arthur_weasley Looking forward to a new term?
harry_potter Yeah, it should be great.
arthur_weasley Harry, there are some within the Ministry who would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you. But, I think that you need to know the facts. You are in danger. Grave danger.
harry_potter Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
arthur_weasley What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
harry_potter Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
arthur_weasley Do you know why? Harry, thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
harry_potter Voldemort...?
arthur_weasley Don't say his name.
harry_potter Sorry.
arthur_weasley ...when you stopped You-Know-Who, Black lost everything. But, to this day he still remains a faithful servant. And, in his mind, you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power. And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban. To find you.
harry_potter And kill me.
arthur_weasley Harry. I want you to swear to me that whatever you might hear -you won't go looking for Black.
harry_potter Mr. Weasley, why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
molly_weasley Quick, quick! Ron, Ron! Oh, for goodness' sake! Don't loose him!
harry_potter I didn't mean to blow her up. I just- I lost control.
ron_weasley Brilliant!
hermione_granger Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
harry_potter I think I was lucky not to be arrested, actually.
ron_weasley I still think it was brilliant.
hermione_granger Come on. Everywhere else is full.
ron_weasley Who d'you think that is?
hermione_granger Professor R. J. Lupin.
ron_weasley You know everything. How is it she knows everything?
hermione_granger It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
ron_weasley Oh.
harry_potter Do you think he's really asleep?
hermione_granger Seems to be. Why?
harry_potter I've got to tell you something.
ron_weasley Let me get this straight. Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
harry_potter Yeah.
hermione_granger But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean- everyone's looking for him.
ron_weasley Sure... except, no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before, and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
harry_potter Thanks, Ron.
hermione_granger Why are we stopping? We can't be there yet...
ron_weasley What's going on?
harry_potter Dunno... maybe we've broken down.
hermione_granger Ouch! Ron, that was my foot!
ron_weasley There's something moving out there. I think... someone's coming aboard. 
ron_weasley Bloody hell! What's happening?
scabbers#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 
harry_potter Ah...
voice#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 
hermione_granger Harry? Harry, are you all right?
harry_potter Thank you.
remus_lupin Here, eat this. It'll help. It's alright, it's chocolate.
harry_potter Wh- what was that thing... that came?
remus_lupin It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. It was searching the train for Sirius Black. If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver. Eat. You'll feel better.
harry_potter What happened to me?
ron_weasley Well, you sort of went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
harry_potter And... and did either of you two? You know... pass out?
ron_weasley No. I felt weird, though. Like I'd never be cheerful again.
harry_potter But someone was screaming. A woman.
hermione_granger No one was screaming, Harry.
choir In the cauldron boil and bake. Fillet of a fenny snake. Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf. Witch's mummy, maw and gulf. Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. Double, double toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble! Something wicked this way comes!
albus_dumbledore Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R. J. Lupin, who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Good luck, Professor!
all#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 
hermione_granger Of course! That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
draco_malfoy Potter... Potter! Is it true you fainted?
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Ohhhh!
draco_malfoy I mean, you actually fainted?
ron_weasley Shove off, Malfoy.
harry_potter How did he find out?
hermione_granger Just forget it.
albus_dumbledore As some of you may know, Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid!
all#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 
hermione_granger Whoo-hoo!
albus_dumbledore Finally, on a more disquieting note, at the request of the Ministry of Magic, Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban, until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. Now, whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution. dementors are vicious creatures. They will not distinguish between the one they hunt, and the one who gets in their way. Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. But, you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times... if only one remembers to turn on the light.
fat_lady_in_painting Ahhhh! Ah-ha-haa-aooo!
seamus_finnigan Fortuna Major. Here, listen. She just won't let me in.
harry_potter Fortuna Major.
fat_lady_in_painting No, no, no- wait. Wait. Watch this! Ah-ha-ha-Aaaah- amazing! Just with my voice!
harry_potter Fortuna Major!
fat_lady_in_painting Yes, alright. Go in.
harry_potter Thank you.
harry_potter She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing!
seamus_finnigan Exactly!
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Hey, man.
dean_thomas Hey, man- ugh!
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Oh, God.
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 That's awful!
ron_weasley Oh, green. That's a monkey.
seamus_finnigan 
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 What is that? You call that a monkey? Do not give him one again.
ron_weasley Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Oh, yeah! That's amazing.
neville_longbottom 
seamus_finnigan Ron, catch.
ron_weasley I will- 
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 I think we have a winner.
ron_weasley Oh, don't try one of them!
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Oh, no.
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Look at him! Look at his face!
professor_sybil_trelawney Welcome, my children. In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination. In this room, you shall discover if you possess... 'the Sight'! Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together, we shall cast ourselves into the future. This term we shall be focusing on Tasseomancy, which is the art of reading tea leaves. So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you... What do you see? The truth lies buried, like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read. But first, you must broaden your minds. First, you must look... beyond!
hermione_granger What a load of rubbish.
ron_weasley Where did you come from?
hermione_granger Me? I've been here all this time.
professor_sybil_trelawney You, boy! Is your grandmother quite well?
neville_longbottom Ah... I- I think so.
professor_sybil_trelawney I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup. Oh, umm. Pity. Broaden your minds. Hmmm. Woah! Your aura is pulsing, dear! Are you in the beyond? I think you are!
ron_weasley Sure.
professor_sybil_trelawney Look at the cup. Tell me what you see.
ron_weasley Oh, yeah, um, well, Harry's got a sort of a wonky cross- that's trials and suffering- and, uh, that there could be the sun- and that's happiness- so, ah, you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
professor_sybil_trelawney Give me the cup. Oh- aah! Oh, dear boy. My dear...you have the Grim!
seamus_finnigan The Grin? What's the Grin?
bem#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Not the grin, you idiot. The Grim. 'Taking the form of a giant spectral dog, it's among the darkest omens in our world. It's an omen of death.'
ron_weasley You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black, do you?
hermione_granger Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a very wooly discipline. Now, Ancient Runes. That's a fascinating subject.
ron_weasley Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking this term?
hermione_granger A fair few.
ron_weasley Hang on. That's not possible. Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination. You'd have to be in two classes at once!
hermione_granger Don't be silly, Ronald. How could anyone be in two classes at once? 'Broaden your minds... use your inner eye to see the future...'
rubeus_hagrid That's it. C'mon now. Come closer! Less talkin', if you don' mind. I got a real treat for yeh today. A great lesson. So follow me.
rubeus_hagrid Right, you lot. Less chatterin'. Form a group over there. And open yer books to page forty-nine.
draco_malfoy And exactly how do we do that?
rubeus_hagrid Well, just stroke the spine, o' course. Goodness me!
neville_longbottom Aaah!
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
neville_longbottom I'm okay. Okay. Aaah!
hermione_granger I think they're funny.
draco_malfoy Oh, yeah. Terribly funny. Really witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until my father hears that Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
gregory_goyle Huh!
vincent_crabbe Ha, ha, ha, ha!
harry_potter Shut up, Malfoy!
draco_malfoy Ooooh!
draco_malfoy Dementor! Dementor!
others#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Ah, ha ha ha ha! Oooooh!
hermione_granger Just ignore him.
ron_weasley You're supposed to stroke it.
neville_longbottom Yeah.
rubeus_hagrid Ahem. Ta-ta-ta-dah! Isn't he beautiful? Say hello to Buckbeak.
ron_weasley Hagrid. Exactly what is that?
rubeus_hagrid That, Ron, is a hippogriff. Firs' thing yeh wanna know abou' hippogriffs is that they're very proud creatures. Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff. It may just be the las' thing yeh ever do. Now, who'd like ter come an' say hello?
rubeus_hagrid Well done, Harry! Well done. Come on, now. Now, you have to let 'im make the firs' move. It's only polite. So, step up, give 'im a nice bow. Then you wait and see if he bows back. And if he does, you can go and touch him. If notwell, we'll get to that later. Just make your bow. Nice and low.
rubeus_hagrid Back off, Harry! Back off! Keep still. Keep still. Oh, ho! Well done, Harry! Well done! Here, ya big brute, ya... Right. I think you can go and pat 'im now. Go on. Don't be shy.
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Ow!
rubeus_hagrid Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow. Not so fast, Harry. Slow down, Harry. That's it... nice and slow. Now let 'im come to you. That's it. Slowly, now, slowly, slowly, that's it... Yes! Well done! Well done, Harry! Well done!
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Does he get to fly?
rubeus_hagrid I think he may let you ride 'im now.
harry_potter What?
rubeus_hagrid Come on.
harry_potter Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... hey! Hagrid...
rubeus_hagrid We'll put you over here, just behind the wing joint. Don' pull out any of 'is feathers, because he won' thank you for that. Heh, heh...
harry_potter Whoah!!
harry_potter Ha! Whoo-hoo! Whoooo-hooo!! Whoo-hoo! Oh!
rubeus_hagrid 
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Well done, Harry!
rubeus_hagrid Well done, Harry! And well done, Buckbeak!
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Yeah, that was wicked, Harry!
draco_malfoy Oh, please!
rubeus_hagrid Well done, well done. How'm I doin' me firs' day?
harry_potter Brilliant... Professor.
draco_malfoy Yes, you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute -
rubeus_hagrid Malfoy, Malfoy! No! Buckbeak! Whoa... whoa... whoa... whoa! Buckbeak! Away, you silly creature!
draco_malfoy Oh, it's killed me! It's killed me!
rubeus_hagrid Calm down! It- it's jus' a scratch...
hermione_granger Hagrid! He's got to be taken to the hospital.
rubeus_hagrid I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
draco_malfoy Oh! Oh! Ohhh, you're going to regret this...
rubeus_hagrid Class dismissed!
draco_malfoy ...you and your bloody chicken!
ghost#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Ah-ha-ha!
pansy_parkinson Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
draco_malfoy It comes and it goes. Still... I consider myself lucky. According to Madam Pomfrey, another minute or two... and I could've, ah, lost my arm. Couldn't possibly do any homework for weeks...
ron_weasley Listen to the idiot. He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
draco_malfoy Please- don't touch it.
harry_potter Yeah, but at least Hagrid didn't get fired.
hermione_granger Yeah, but I hear Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this...
seamus_finnigan He's been sighted! He's been sighted!
neville_longbottom Who?
seamus_finnigan Sirius Black!
hermione_granger Dufftown? That's not far from here...
neville_longbottom You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts... do you?
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 With the dementors at every entrance?
seamus_finnigan Dementors? He's already slipped by them once, hasn't he? Who's to say he can't do it again?
bem#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke. Like trying to catch smoke through your bare hands.
remus_lupin Intriguing, isn't it? Would anyone like to venture a guess... as to what is inside?
dean_thomas That's a Boggart, that is.
remus_lupin Very good, Mr. Thomas. Now, can anybody tell me what a Boggart looks like?
hermione_granger No one knows.
ron_weasley When'd she get here?
hermione_granger Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. That's what makes them so -
remus_lupin -so terrifying, yes, yes, yes. Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a Boggart. Let's practice it now. Ah, without wands, please... after me... Riddikulus!
students#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Riddikulus!
remus_lupin very good. a little louder, and very clear. listen Riddikulus!
students#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Riddikulus!
draco_malfoy This class is ridiculous.
remus_lupin Very good- well, so much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough. What really finishes a Boggart is... laughter. You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. Let me explain. Ah- Neville, would you join me, please? Come on. Don't be shy, come on. Come on.
remus_lupin Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?
neville_longbottom Profter... S- Snafpt...
remus_lupin Sorry.
neville_longbottom Professor Snape.
remus_lupin Professor Snape. Yes, frightens us all. And I believe you live with your grandmother?
neville_longbottom Yes, but I don't want that Boggart to turn into her, either.
remus_lupin No...It won't. I want you to picture her clothes, only her clothes, very clearly in your mind.
neville_longbottom She carries a red handbag...
remus_lupin We don't need to hear it. As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when
I#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 open that wardrobe, here's what I want you to do... Excuse me... Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
remus_lupin Can you do that? Yes. Wand at the ready. One. Two. Three. Think, Neville. Think!
neville_longbottom Riddikulus!
others#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
remus_lupin Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay! To the back, Neville. Everyone form a line. Form a line. I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most, and turn it into something funny. Next! Ron! Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave!
ron_weasley Ooh..
remus_lupin Wand at the ready, Ron. Wand at the ready!
ron_weasley Riddikulus!
others#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Ha, ha, ha, ha!
remus_lupin Yes! You see? Very good, very good! Marvelous! Absolutely very, very enjoyable! Parvati, next! Step up. Show us what you see. Keep your nerve. Steady...
parvati_patil Riddikulus!
others#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Ha, ha, ha, ha!
remus_lupin And next! Step up, step up! Wonderful, wonderful. Heeere! Riddikulus! Right, well, sorry about that. Ah, that's enough for today. If you'd all like to collect your books from the back of the class, that's the end of the lesson. Thank you... Sorry, sorry, you've already had too much of a good thing.
professor_mcgonagall Now, remember! These visits to Hogsmeade Village are a privilege. Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in any way, that privilege shall not be extended again. No permission form signed, no visiting the Village. That's the rule, Potter.
mr_filch Those with permission follow me. Those without, stay put.
harry_potter But Professor, I thought if you signed it, then I could go.
professor_mcgonagall I can't. Only a parent or guardian can sign. Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word.
harry_potter Forget about it guys. See you later.
harry_potter Professor, can I ask you something?
remus_lupin You want to know why I stopped you facing that Boggart, yes? I would've thought it'd be obvious. I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
harry_potter I did think of Voldemort... at first. But then, I remembered that night on the train... and the dementor...
remus_lupin Well, I'm very impressed. That suggests that what you fear the most is fear itself. This is very wise.
harry_potter Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman. Screaming.
remus_lupin Well, dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. Our pain becomes their power.
harry_potter I think it was my mother. The night she was murdered.
remus_lupin You know, the very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by your scar, by your eyes. They're your mother Lily's. Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her. Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. Not only was she a singularly gifted witch, she was also an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in others, even -- and perhaps, most especially... when that person couldn't see it in themselves... And your father, James, on the other hand, he ah, heh- He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. You're more like them than you know, Harry. In time you'll come to see just how much.
ron_weasley Honeydukes Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop. We never did get to go to the Shrieking Shack, though. You heard that it's the most
harry_potter -most haunted building in Briton. Yeah, I know. What's going on?
ron_weasley Probably Neville's forgotten the password again.
neville_longbottom Hey!
ron_weasley Oh, you're there!
percy_weasley Let me through, please. Excuse me, I'm Head Boy... Get back! All of you! No one is to enter this dormitory until it has been fully searched!
ginny_weasley The Fat Lady... she's gone.
ron_weasley Serves her right. She was a terrible singer.
hermione_granger It's not funny, Ron.
percy_weasley Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room. Be quiet.
mr_filch Make way. Make way.
percy_weasley The Headmaster's here.
mr_filch Come on, move!
percy_weasley You heard! Move!
albus_dumbledore Mr. Filch. Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
mr_filch There's no need for ghosts, Professor... The Fat Lady's there.
percy_weasley Hey- mind where you're going! Slow down! You listen! I'm Head Boy!
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Come back here!
albus_dumbledore Keep moving. Dear lady, who did this to you?
fat_lady_in_painting Eyes like the devil, he's got. And a soul as dark as his name. It's him, Headmaster. The one they all talk about. He's here, somewhere in the castle! Sirius Black! Aaah-hoo-hoo!
albus_dumbledore Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you... to the Great Hall.
mr_filch I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery, sir, but there's nothing there.
albus_dumbledore Thank you.
professor_binns#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 The third floor's clear, to, sir.
albus_dumbledore Very good.
professor_snape I've done the dungeons, Headmaster. No sign of Black. Nor anywhere else in the castle.
albus_dumbledore Thank you. I didn't really expect him to linger.
professor_snape Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts castle on one's own, completely undetected...
albus_dumbledore Quite remarkable, yes.
professor_snape Any theories about how he might have managed it?
albus_dumbledore Many, each as unlikely as the next.
professor_snape You may recall that prior to the start of term, I did express concerns about your appointment of Professor
albus_dumbledore Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it. No, I'm quite convinced the castle is safe. And I'm more than willing to send the students back to their Houses.
professor_snape What about Potter? Should he be warned?
albus_dumbledore Perhaps... But for now, let him sleep... For in dreams we enter a world that's entirely our own. Let them swim in the deepest ocean, or glide over the highest cloud.
professor_snape Turn to page three hundred and ninety-four.
harry_potter Excuse me, sir... where's Professor Lupin?
professor_snape That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say, your Professor finds himself incapable of teaching... at the present time. Turn to page three hundred and ninety-four!
ron_weasley 'Werewolves?'
hermione_granger But, sir, we've just begun learning about Red Caps and Hinkypunks. We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts for weeks
professor_snape Quiet!
ron_weasley When did she come in? Did you see her come in?
professor_snape Now. Which of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?
professor_snape No one? How disappointing.
hermione_granger Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice. With each full moon when he transforms he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path. Furthermore, the werewolf only responds only to the call of its own kind –
draco_malfoy Owooo!
professor_snape Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Are you incapable of restraining yourself, or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
ron_weasley He's got a point, you know.
professor_snape Five points from Gryffindor! As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk by Monday morning, two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with particular emphasis on recognizing it.
harry_potter But, sir, it's Quidditch tomorrow.
professor_snape Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter. Loss of limb will not excuse you. Page three hundred and ninety-four.
professor_snape The term 'werewolf' is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word 'wer', which means 'man', and 'wolf'. 'Werewolf', 'man-wolf.' There are several ways to become a werewolf. They include being given the power of shape-shifting, being bitten by a werewolf, or...
fans#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Go, Go, Gryffindor! Go, Go Gryffindor!
hermione_granger Go, Harry! Whoo-hoo! Go, Harry!
others#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Eeee! Ahhh!
others#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Harry!
albus_dumbledore Aresto momentum!
ron_weasley He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
fred_weasley Peaky? What d'you expect? He fell over a hundred feet.
george_weasley Yeah, c'mon, Ron. Let's walk you off the Astronomy Tower
fred_weasley -and see what you look like.
harry_potter Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
hermione_granger How're you feeling?
harry_potter Oh, brilliant.
fred_weasley You gave us a right good scare there, mate.
harry_potter What happened?
ron_weasley Well, you fell off your broom.
harry_potter Really? I meant the match. Who won?
hermione_granger Um- no one blames you, Harry. The dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. Dumbledore was furious. As soon as he saved you, he sent them straight off.
ron_weasley There's uh- something else you should know, too, Harry, um. When you fell, your broom– it- it sort of... blew into the Whomping Willow. And, well...
remus_lupin I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
remus_lupin Is there no chance of fixing it?
harry_potter No. Professor, why do the dementors affect me so? I mean, more than everyone else...
remus_lupin Listen, the dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory, until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. You are not weak, Harry. The dementors affect you, most of all, because there are true horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be ashamed of.
harry_potter I'm scared, Professor.
remus_lupin Well, I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
harry_potter I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. You made that dementor on the train go away...
remus_lupin There was only one that night...
harry_potter But you made it go away.
remus_lupin I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But, as the dementors seem to have developed a particular interest in you, huh, perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays. For now, I need to rest.
mr_filch Last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now! All those for Hogsmeade! Come on, now, get out of here! Come on!
harry_potter Guys, let me go!
fred_weasley Clever, Harry.
george_weasley But not clever enough.
fred_weasley Besides, we've got a better way.
harry_potter Guys, come on! I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
george_weasley We know.
fred_weasley Don't worry.
george_weasley We'll get you there.
fred_weasley We'll show you a quicker way.
george_weasley If you pipe down.
fred_weasley Ah, bless him.
harry_potter Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't
george_weasley Now, Harry.
george_weasley Come and join the big boys.
harry_potter What are you doing?!
george_weasley Sssh!
harry_potter What's this rubbish?
fred_weasley 'What's this rubbish?' he says. That there is the secret to our success.
george_weasley It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me.
fred_weasley But we've decided your need's are greater than ours. George, if you will...
george_weasley I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
harry_potter 'Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present The Marauder's Map'...?
george_weasley We owe them so much.
harry_potter Hang on. This is Hogwarts! And that... no. Is that really...?
fred_weasley Dumbledore.
george_weasley In his study.
fred_weasley Pacing.
george_weasley Does that a lot.
harry_potter So you mean, this map shows...
fred_weasley Everyone.
harry_potter Everyone?
george_weasley Everyone.
fred_weasley Where they are.
george_weasley What they're doing.
fred_weasley Every minute.
george_weasley Of every day.
harry_potter Brilliant! Where'd you get it?
fred_weasley Nicked it from Filch's office, of course, first year.
george_weasley Now listen. There are seven secret passageways out of the castle. We'd recommend...
george_weasley This one.
george_weasley The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
george_weasley It'll lead you straight to Honeydukes cellar.
fred_weasley But you'd best hurry. Filch is heading this way.
george_weasley Oh, and, Harry? Don't forget, when you're done, just give it a tap and say,
george_weasley 'Mischief managed.' Otherwise, anyone can read it.
woman#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Now, don't forget these!
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Now, how much do you want?
seamus_finnigan Delicious!
hermione_granger It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
ron_weasley Twice.
hermione_granger Oh. Do you want to move a bit closer?
ron_weasley Huh?
hermione_granger To the Shrieking Shack?
ron_weasley Oh, oh, actually, I- I'm, I'm fine here.
draco_malfoy Well, well. Look who's here. You two shopping for your new dream home? A bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasel-Bee? Don't your family sleep in, ah- one room?
ron_weasley Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
draco_malfoy Ooh- not very friendly. Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasel-Bee how to respect his superiors.
hermione_granger Oh, ha, ha. I hope you don't mean yourself.
draco_malfoy How dare you talk to me, you filthy, little mudblood! -- Who is there?! Don't just stand there! Do something!
vincent_crabbe What?
vincent_crabbe Ahh! Ahhhh!
draco_malfoy Ahhh!
ron_weasley What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?
draco_malfoy Get out of the way! Move!
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
hermione_granger Harry!
ron_weasley Bloody hell, Harry! That was not funny!
hermione_granger Ha, ha, ha, ha!
ron_weasley Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map!
hermione_granger But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall, aren't you?
ron_weasley Oh, sure. Along with his invisibility cloak?
hermione_granger Oh, look who it is. Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her.
ron_weasley It's not true!
cornelius_fudge Professor McGonagall!
professor_mcgonagall Cornelius!
rubeus_hagrid Allow me, Minister.
cornelius_fudge Oh, Hagrid...
rubeus_hagrid Sorry abou' that!
cornelius_fudge Rosmerta, m'dear! I hope business is good?
madame_rosmerta It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night!
cornelius_fudge We..have...we have a killer on the loose.
madame_rosmerta Oh, Sirius Black? In Hogsmeade! And what would bring him here?
cornelius_fudge Harry Potter.
madame_rosmerta Harry Potter?!
cornelius_fudge Ssh! Come.
hermione_granger Harry!
shrunken_head I say, no underage wizards allowed in today!
shrunken_head Shut the damn door!
hermione_granger So rude!
ron_weasley Thick heads.
shrunken_head Thick heads?!
shrunken_head How dare they! Who are they calling thick heads?
shrunken_head Young whippersnappers!
madame_rosmerta Nobody's going to come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
professor_mcgonagall Well, Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place, I can assure you.
madame_rosmerta Now, tell me what this is all about.
professor_mcgonagall Well, now years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death, do you remember? They went into hiding. Few knew where they were. One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who.
cornelius_fudge Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who to the Potters that night, but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew!
madame_rosmerta Peter Pettigrew?
professor_mcgonagall Yes, little lump of a boy? Always trailing after Sirius Black and...
madame_rosmerta I remember him. Never let James and Sirius out of his sight. But what happened?
professor_mcgonagall Well, Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters, and might have managed to, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
cornelius_fudge Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him! A finger. That's all that was left. A finger– nothing else.
professor_mcgonagall Yes. Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the reason they're dead.
cornelius_fudge And now he wants to finish what he started.
professor_mcgonagall Uh-huh.
madame_rosmerta I don't believe it...
cornelius_fudge Huh- that's not the worst of it.
madame_rosmerta What could be worse?
professor_mcgonagall this Sirius Black was, and remains to this day... Harry Potter's godfather!
hermione_granger Ron, look! Sorry, sorry! Excuse me... excuse me, sorry...
hermione_granger Harry, what happened?
harry_potter He was their friend... and he betrayed them. He was their friend! I hope he finds me. Because when he does, I'm going to be ready! When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
remus_lupin Harry. There you are. You came.
remus_lupin Now, are you sure about this, Harry? You know this is very advanced magic, well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level.
harry_potter I'm sure.
remus_lupin well, everything is prepared. now, the spell i'm going to try to teach you is called the patronus charm. did you ever hear of it? no? well... a patronus is a kind of positive force, and for the wizard who can conjure one, it works something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. but in order for it to work, you need think of a memory. and not just any memory, a very happy memory. a very powerful memory. can you do this? yes. very well. close your eyes... concentrate... explore your past... do you have a memory? allow it to fill you up... lose yourself within it... then speak the incantation Expecto Patronum.
harry_potter Expecto Patronum...
remus_lupin Very good. Shall we? Wand at the ready.
harry_potter Expecto Patronum! Expecto... Expecta... Expect...
remus_lupin Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths. It's alright. I didn't expect you to do it the first time. Huh- that would have been remarkable! Here, eat this. You'll feel better.
harry_potter That's one nasty dementor.
remus_lupin Oh, no, no, no, no, no. That was a Boggart, Harry. A Boggart. The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. As a matter of interest, what were you thinking? Which memory did you choose?
harry_potter The first time I rode a broom.
remus_lupin Well, that's not good enough. Not nearly good enough.
harry_potter There's another. It's not happy, exactly. Well, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt. Uh, but it's complicated.
remus_lupin Is it strong? Then let's give it a try. Do you feel ready?
harry_potter Just do it.
harry_potter Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum!
remus_lupin Ha, ha, ha, ah, ha! Yes! Well done, Harry. Well done!
harry_potter I think I've had enough. For today.
remus_lupin yes, sit down. here. eat this, it helps. it really helps. and just so you know, harry I think you would have given your father a run for his money. And that... is saying something.
harry_potter I was thinking of him. And Mum. Seeing their faces. They were talking to me. Just talking. That's the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real... But it's the best I have.
hermione_granger Beautiful day.
ron_weasley Gorgeous. Unless, of course, you've been ripped to pieces!
harry_potter Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?
hermione_granger Ronald has lost his rat.
ron_weasley I haven't lost anything! Your cat killed him!
hermione_granger Rubbish!
ron_weasley Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurkin' about. And Scabbers is gone!
hermione_granger Well, maybe you should learn to take better care of your pets!
ron_weasley Your cat killed him!
hermione_granger Did not!
ron_weasley Did.
hermione_granger Didn't.
hermione_granger How'd it go, Hagrid? At the hearing?
rubeus_hagrid Well, first off, the committee members took turns talkin' abou' why we were there. And then I got up an' did my piece – said how Buckbeak was a good Hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then Lucius Malfoy got up an', well you can imagine, he said "Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill ya as soon as look at ya."
hermione_granger And then?
rubeus_hagrid An' then he asked for the worst, he did, ol' Lucius.
ron_weasley They're not sacking you!
rubeus_hagrid No, I'm not sacked. Buckbeak's been sentenced ter death!
ron_weasley Oh, ah- Spiders! T-there's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap dance. I don' wanna tap dance.
harry_potter You tell those spiders, Ron.
ron_weasley Oh, yeah. T- t- tell them. I'll tell 'em... I'll tell 'em...
madame_rosmerta  Peter Pettigrew?
professor_mcgonagall  Little lump of a boy. Always trailing after Sirius Black...
cornelius_fudge  Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him!
portrait_#1#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Put that light out!
harry_potter Sorry! Ah!
portrait_#2#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Watch it there, boy!
portrait#3#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 We're trying to sleep here!
portrait_#2#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Yes, we are!
harry_potter Mischief managed! Nox!
professor_snape Potter. What're you doing wandering the corridors at night?
harry_potter I was sleepwalking...
professor_snape How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly arrogant. Strutting about the castle.
harry_potter My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
professor_snape Turn out your pockets. Turn out your pockets!
professor_snape What's this.
harry_potter Spare bit of parchment...
professor_snape Really... Open it. Reveal your secrets! Read it.
harry_potter 'Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and...'
professor_snape Go on.
harry_potter '... and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.'
professor_snape Why you insolent little
remus_lupin Professor...?
professor_snape Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
remus_lupin Harry? Are you all right?
professor_snape That remains to be seen. I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. This is supposed to be your area of expertise. Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.
remus_lupin I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks to me as if it is merely a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall pursue any hidden qualities it may possess. It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night.
portrait#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 #1 Are you deaf? Put that light out!
remus_lupin Come in. Now, I haven't the faintest idea, Harry, how this map came to be in your possession, but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in. Did it never occur to you that this- in the hands of Sirius Black- is a map to you? No.
harry_potter No, sir.
remus_lupin You know, your father never set much store by the rules either. But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. And gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected, with a killer on the loose, seems to me to be a pretty poor way to repay them! Now, I will not cover up for you again, Harry. Do you hear me?
harry_potter Yes, sir.
remus_lupin I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know.
harry_potter Professor. Just so you know, I don't think the map always works. Earlier on, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead.
remus_lupin Oh, really? Who might that be?
harry_potter Peter Pettigrew.
remus_lupin That's not possible.
harry_potter It's just what I saw... Good night, Professor.
professor_sybil_trelawney Broaden your minds... You must look beyond... The art of crystal-gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye. Only then, can you see. Try again. Now, what do we have here...?
ron_weasley ...Huh?
hermione_granger Oh, ah- do you mind me trying?
professor_sybil_trelawney Ah!
hermione_granger The Grim. Possibly.
professor_sybil_trelawney My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class, I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there. Ah, you may be young in years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 What's happened? I can't believe it!
professor_sybil_trelawney Have I said something?
ron_weasley She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental, but now it's out in the open for everyone to see...
harry_potter Hang on- we'd better take this back.
ron_weasley I'm not goin' back.
harry_potter Fine. See you later.
ron_weasley See you.
crystal_ball#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Harry Potter... Harry Potter...
professor_sybil_trelawney Ahh!
harry_potter Professor Trelawney
professor_sybil_trelawney He will return tonight....
harry_potter Sorry?
professor_sybil_trelawney Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder, shall break free. Innocent blood shall be spilt, and servant and Master shall be reunited once more... ah, ach...
professor_sybil_trelawney Oh- I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something?
harry_potter No. Nothing.
hermione_granger I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak! It's just too horrible.
harry_potter It just got worse.
draco_malfoy Did I tell you? Father said I can keep the hippogriff's head. I think I'll donate it to the Gryffindor's common room.
vincent_crabbe Wicked.
draco_malfoy Oh, this is going to be rich.
vincent_crabbe Look who's here.
draco_malfoy Ah. Come to see the show?
hermione_granger You! You... foul... loathsome... evil... little cockroach!
ron_weasley Hermione! No! He's not worth it.
draco_malfoy He, he, heh... oh!
vincent_crabbe Malfoy, you okay? Let's go.
gregory_goyle Quick!
draco_malfoy Not a word to anyone, understood?
hermione_granger That felt good.
ron_weasley Not good, brilliant!
rubeus_hagrid Ow, look at 'im. Loves the smell o' the trees when the wind blows through 'em...
harry_potter Why don't we just set him free?
rubeus_hagrid Ah- they'd know it was me. And then Dumbledore'd get into trouble. He's commin' down, yeh know, Dumbledore. Says he wants ter be with me when they... when it happens. Great man, Dumbledore. Great man.
hermione_granger We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.
rubeus_hagrid You'll do no such thing! Ya think I wan' yeh seein' sumthing like that? No. Yeh just drink yer tea an' be off. Oh, but before yeh do- Ron...
ron_weasley Scabbers! You're alive!
rubeus_hagrid Ye'll want to keep a closer eye on yer pets, Ron.
hermione_granger I think that means you owe someone an apology.
ron_weasley Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
hermione_granger I meant me!
rubeus_hagrid Blimey! Wha' was that?
harry_potter Ow! Ah...
harry_potter Hagrid...
rubeus_hagrid Oh, crikey!
albus_dumbledore Now, Minister, over this way...
rubeus_hagrid It's late. It's nearly dark.
rubeus_hagrid Yeh shouldn't be here. Someone sees yeh outside the castle this time o' night, you'll be in trouble! Big trouble! Particularly you, Harry – Be with you in a moment! Quick! Quick!
harry_potter Hagrid. It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
rubeus_hagrid Go on, go on!
albus_dumbledore That's the ling you see over there...
cornelius_fudge On the slope...
albus_dumbledore ...on the slope- Ah, Hagrid,
rubeus_hagrid Professor Dumbledore.
albus_dumbledore Good evening, Hagrid.
rubeus_hagrid Just make your way through, ah. Have some tea, if you like.
cornelius_fudge No, Hagrid, no. Gentlemen...
albus_dumbledore I'd like a cup of tea.
cornelius_fudge Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak, hereinafter called 'the condemned', shall be executed this day at sundown.
rubeus_hagrid Dear, dear...
albus_dumbledore Now, now, Hagrid, now come on. All right. It'll be all right.
cornelius_fudge The executioner shall be dispatched...
harry_potter What?
hermione_granger I just thought I saw... Never mind.
ron_weasley Let's go!
rubeus_hagrid Buckbeak didn't mean no harm!
ron_weasley Oh! Oh, no... Hah- he bit me! Scabbers!
hermione_granger Ron. Ron! No!
harry_potter Ron!
ron_weasley Scabbers, come back!
harry_potter Wait!
ron_weasley Scabbers, you bit me!
hermione_granger Harry. You do realize what tree this is...
ron_weasley Now behave yourself.
harry_potter That's not good. Ron, run!
ron_weasley Harry! Hermione, Run! It's the Grim!
ron_weasley Aaaahhh! Harry!
harry_potter Ron! Ron, wait!
hermione_granger Ron!
ron_weasley Haaarry! Help!
harry_potter Ron! Ron. Ron!
hermione_granger Ron!
ron_weasley Harry!
hermione_granger Uumph!
ron_weasley Aaah!
harry_potter Come on! Move!
hermione_granger Duck! Aaaaeee! Aeeeeee! Oh! Oh! Harry! Oh!
harry_potter Aaah! Umph!
hermione_granger Oh, I'm sorry!
harry_potter Don't worry.
hermione_granger Where do you suppose this goes?
harry_potter I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong...
hermione_granger We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
harry_potter Come on.
harry_potter Ron!
hermione_granger Ron! You okay?
harry_potter The dog- where's is it?
ron_weasley Harry! It's a trap! He's the dog. He's an Animagus...
hermione_granger If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us, too!
sirius_black No. Only one will die tonight.
harry_potter Then it'll be you!
sirius_black Ha, Ha! Ha, ha, ha! Are you going to kill me, Harry?
remus_lupin Expelliarmus!
ron_weasley Professor Lupin!
remus_lupin Well, well, Sirius, looking a bit ragged, aren't we? Finally the flesh reflects the madness within.
sirius_black Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus?
sirius_black I found him!
remus_lupin I know.
sirius_black It's him!
remus_lupin I understand.
sirius_black Let's kill him!
hermione_granger No! I trusted you! And all this time you've been his friend! He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes!
remus_lupin How long have you known?
hermione_granger Since Professor Snape set the essay.
remus_lupin Well, well, well, Hermione, you really are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
sirius_black Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him!
remus_lupin Wait-
sirius_black I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban!
remus_lupin Very well. Kill him! But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why.
harry_potter I know why. You betrayed my parents! You're the reason they're dead.
remus_lupin No, Harry, it wasn't him. Somebody did betray your parents, but it was somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead.
harry_potter Who was it then?
sirius_black Peter Pettigrew! And he's in this room! Right now! Come out, come out, Peter. Come out, come out and play...
professor_snape Expelliarmus! Ah, vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
remus_lupin Severus
professor_snape I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle. And now, here's the proof.
sirius_black Brilliant, Snape! Once again you've put your keen and penetrating mind to the task and, as usual, come to the wrong conclusion. Now, if you'll excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business to attend to.
professor_snape Give me a reason. I beg you!
remus_lupin Severus, don't be a fool!
sirius_black He can't help it. It's habit by now.
remus_lupin Sirius, be quiet!
sirius_black Be quiet, yourself, Remus!
professor_snape Listen to you two. Quarreling like an old married couple.
sirius_black Why don't you just run along and play with your chemistry set?
professor_snape I could do it, you know. But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you. Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes. A dementor's kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like to endure. It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
remus_lupin Severus, please
professor_snape After you.
harry_potter Expelliarmus!
ron_weasley Harry. What did you just do?
hermione_granger You attacked a teacher!
harry_potter Tell me about Peter Pettigrew.
remus_lupin He was at school with us. We thought he was our friend.
harry_potter No. Pettigrew's dead. He killed him!
remus_lupin No he didn't! I thought so, too, until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the Map!
harry_potter The Map was lying then.
sirius_black The Map never lies! Pettigrew's alive, and he's right there!
ron_weasley M- me? He's mental!
sirius_black Not you, y-. Your rat!
ron_weasley Scabbers has been in my family for
sirius_black Twelve years. A curiously long life for a common garden rat. He's missing a toe, isn't he?
ron_weasley So what?
harry_potter All they could find of Pettigrew was his
sirius_black -finger! The dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead. And then he transformed into a rat.
harry_potter Show me. Give it to him, Ron.
ron_weasley What are you going to do to him? Scabbers! Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing? Scabbers!
peter_pettigrew Aaaah! R- Remus... S- Sirius... My old friends! H- Harry! Look at you! Y- you look just like your father. Like James. We were the best of friends, he and I
sirius_black How dare you speak to Harry! How dare you talk about James in front of him!
remus_lupin You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?!
peter_pettigrew I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord, you have no idea the weapons he possesses! Ask yourself, Sirius, what you would have done? What would you have done?
sirius_black I would have died! I would have died rather than betray my friends!
peter_pettigrew Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed! Your dad- Your dad would have spared me! He would have shown me mercy!
remus_lupin You should have realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would. Together!
harry_potter No!
remus_lupin Harry, this man is...
harry_potter I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.
peter_pettigrew Bless you, boy! Bless you
harry_potter Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the dementors can have you.
sirius_black Sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit.
ron_weasley A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!
sirius_black Well, I was going for the rat. Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog. In fact, more than once James suggested that I make the change permanent. The tail I could live with, but the fleas, they're murder.
harry_potter Okay... Okay.
ron_weasley You've gotta go.
harry_potter No, no- don't worry. That's fine, I'll stay.
hermione_granger You go, I'll stay.
harry_potter You okay?
ron_weasley I'm fine. Go.
hermione_granger Ah- that looks really painful.
ron_weasley So painful... they, ah, they might chop it...
hermione_granger I'm sure Madam Pomfrey'll fix it in a heartbeat.
ron_weasley It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.
sirius_black It's beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. That was a noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it.
harry_potter Well, I just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends to become killers. Besides, dead, the truth dies with him. Alive... you're free.
peter_pettigrew Turn me into a maggot. A dung beetle. A Flobberworm! Anything but the dementors... Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you? I was your rat!
peter_pettigrew Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely you won't let them...
remus_lupin Get away from her!
sirius_black I don't know if you know, Harry, but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather...
harry_potter I know.
sirius_black And, well, I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle, but, if you ever wanted a different home.
harry_potter What? Come and live with you?
sirius_black Well, it's- it's just a thought. I can understand if you don't want to.
hermione_granger Harry!
sirius_black Remus, my old friend... have you taken your potion tonight? You know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! This heart! Here! Remus, this flesh is only flesh!
harry_potter Expelliarmus!
hermione_granger Harry!
sirius_black Remus! Remus! Run! Run!
harry_potter Come on!
hermione_granger Wait! Wait!
ron_weasley Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea. Bad idea.
hermione_granger Professor? Professor Lupin?
ron_weasley Nice doggy. Nice doggy...
professor_snape There you are, Potter!
hermione_granger Aee!
harry_potter Sirius!
professor_snape Come back here, Potter!
harry_potter Sirius! No! Sirius!
sirius_black Whoa...
harry_potter Expecto... Patronum! Expecto... Patronum...
hermione_granger Harry?
harry_potter I saw my dad.
hermione_granger What...?
harry_potter He sent the dementors away... I saw him across the lake...
hermione_granger Listen, Harry. They've captured Sirius. Any minute the dementors are going to perform the Kiss.
harry_potter You mean they're going to kill him?
hermione_granger No. It's worse. They're going to suck out his soul. Headmaster! You've got to stop them! They've got the wrong man!
harry_potter It's true, sir. Sirius is innocent.
ron_weasley It's Scabbers who did it!
albus_dumbledore Scabbers...?
ron_weasley He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. Well, he was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat— but then they gave him an owl, and I got
hermione_granger The point is... we know the truth. Please, believe us.
albus_dumbledore I do, Miss Granger. But I'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. 
albus_dumbledore A mysterious thing, time. Powerful. And, when meddled with... dangerous. Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. If not... the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. If you succeed tonight, more than one innocent life may be spared. Three turns should do it, I think. Oh, by the way, when in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck.
ron_weasley What the bloody hell was all that all about?
hermione_granger Sorry, Ron. But seeing as you can't walk...
harry_potter What just happened? Where's Ron?
hermione_granger It's seven-thirty. Where were we at seven-thirty?
harry_potter I dunno... going to Hagrid's?
hermione_granger Come on! And we can't be seen!
harry_potter Hermione!
harry_potter Hermione! Hermione, wait! Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
draco_malfoy  Ah. Come to see the show?
hermione_granger  You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
harry_potter But that... that's us.
ron_weasley  Hermione, no! He's not worth it!
harry_potter This is not normal!
hermione_granger This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
harry_potter You mean, we've gone back in time?
hermione_granger Yes. Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
harry_potter Good punch.
hermione_granger Thanks. Malfoy's coming!
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03  Come on, let's go! Run! Wait for me! Run!
draco_malfoy  Not a word of this to anyone, understood!
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03  Okay!
draco_malfoy  I'm gonna get that jumped-up Mudblood! Mark my words...
hermione_granger  That felt good!
ron_weasley  Not good. Brilliant!
harry_potter  Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
harry_potter Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
hermione_granger Of course! Remember what Dumbledore said. If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. Let's go!
rubeus_hagrid  ...Great man, Dumbledore, great man.
harry_potter Here they come. I'd better hurry.
hermione_granger Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
ron_weasley  Scabbers! You're alive!
rubeus_hagrid  Keep a closer eye on your pet...
harry_potter That's Pettigrew
hermione_granger Harry! You can't!
harry_potter Hermione, that's the man who betrayed my parents! You don't expect me to just sit here...
hermione_granger Yes! You must! Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. If you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time, Harry. We can't be seen.
hermione_granger Fudge is coming and... we aren't leaving... why aren't we leaving?
albus_dumbledore  There are many changes I think on the grounds...
harry_potter Are you mad?
harry_potter  Ow!
harry_potter That hurt.
hermione_granger Sorry. C'mon. We're coming out the back door. Go!
cornelius_fudge  'It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the Hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned, shall be executed this day at sundown...'
hermione_granger Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
harry_potter Shhh!
ron_weasley  Blimey.
harry_potter  What?
hermione_granger  Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind.
ron_weasley  Let's go!
cornelius_fudge  "The executioner shall dispatch the condemned..."
albus_dumbledore  I really think the minister might feel it in his heart to have a change of heart...
hermione_granger Okay, go, Harry! Go!
cornelius_fudge  It seems the decision has been made, Dumbledore, nothing you nor I can do...
harry_potter Get off! Get away! Get off!
albus_dumbledore  Minister, do you really want to cut off the head of the hippogriff?
cornelius_fudge  No, I do not.
harry_potter C'mon, Buckbeak. Come on...
cornelius_fudge  'As witnessed below.' Sign, just here... You sign here, Hagrid. "The executioner, acting on behalf of the Committee..." Very well, gentlemen. Shall we step outside...
albus_dumbledore  Ah, ah, Minister. I really think I should sign as well...
cornelius_fudge  Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be a good thing if you...
harry_potter Okay, Buckbeak. Come on quickly. Come with us, now. Come on!
hermione_granger Keep trying. Come on! Quickly!
harry_potter Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
cornelius_fudge  ...right here on the line, your name only.
albus_dumbledore  It is a very long name...
harry_potter Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
hermione_granger Come on. Come on, Buckbeak. Come and get the nice dead ferret... come on, it's here, come on Beaky.
albus_dumbledore  Here we are Minister, follow me... now look there, see...
cornelius_fudge  Where?
albus_dumbledore  Look, beyond the rocks.
cornelius_fudge  What am I supposed to see?
albus_dumbledore  Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was Headmaster...
cornelius_fudge  Oh, yes, indeed, indeed.
albus_dumbledore  And all the strawberries, you see...
cornelius_fudge  Strawberries, I see no strawberries.
albus_dumbledore  Over there.
cornelius_fudge  Where?
albus_dumbledore  Over there. Look.
hermione_granger This way!
cornelius_fudge  Well, let's get this over with, please.
albus_dumbledore  All right.
cornelius_fudge  But, where is it? I just saw the beast, just now – not a moment ago!
albus_dumbledore  How extraordinary!
rubeus_hagrid  Buckbeak?
cornelius_fudge  Oh, come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him. Hagrid?
rubeus_hagrid  Professor, I didn't!
albus_dumbledore  I don't think the Minister's suggesting that you had anything to do with this, Hagrid. After all, how could you? Well, you've been with us all the time.
rubeus_hagrid Well- right!
cornelius_fudge  Well, well... We must search the grounds-
albus_dumbledore  Well, search the skies if you must, Minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea. Or... a large brandy. Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. Thank you.
rubeus_hagrid  You'll find no small glasses in this house, Professor, heh, heh.
hermione_granger Come on.
harry_potter This way.
hermione_granger Come on this way. Come on.
harry_potter This way, now.
harry_potter Now what?
hermione_granger We save Sirius.
harry_potter How?
hermione_granger No idea.
hermione_granger Look. It's Lupin.
remus_lupin  Immobililus!
hermione_granger And Snape's coming.
harry_potter And now we wait.
hermione_granger And now we wait.
hermione_granger At least someone's enjoying himself.
harry_potter Yeah. Hermione...
hermione_granger Yeah?
harry_potter Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... I did see someone... that someone made the dementors go away...
hermione_granger With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. According to him, only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
harry_potter It was my dad. It was my dad who conjured the Patronus.
hermione_granger But, Harry, your dad's...
harry_potter Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw.
hermione_granger Here we come.
harry_potter You see Sirius talking to me there?
hermione_granger Uh-huh.
harry_potter He's asking me to come live with him.
hermione_granger That's great.
harry_potter When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursley's. It'll just be me and him. We could live in the country. Someplace you can see the sky. I think he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
hermione_granger  Harry!
sirius_black  Run! Run!
harry_potter Let's go!
hermione_granger Ow-oooooh!
harry_potter What are you doing?
hermione_granger Saving your life.
hermione_granger Ow-oooooh!
harry_potter Thanks. Great. Now he's coming for us.
hermione_granger Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!
hermione_granger Ah! That was so scary!
harry_potter Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night!
harry_potter Sirius. Come on!
hermione_granger This is horrible...
harry_potter Don't worry. My dad will come... he'll conjure the Patronus... any minute now... right there... you'll see...
hermione_granger Harry, listen to me. No one's coming...
harry_potter Don't worry, he will. He will come!
harry_potter Sirius.
hermione_granger You're dying... both of you...
hermione_granger Harry!
harry_potter Expecto Patronum!
harry_potter You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me! I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time, because... well, I'd already done it. Does that make sense?
hermione_granger No! But I don't like flying- aeee!
harry_potter Whoo-hoo!
hermione_granger Bombarda!
sirius_black Ha-ha-ha! Ha, haa, ha, ha!
harry_potter Whoo-hoo! Whoo-whoo-whoo-hoo! Whooo!
sirius_black I'll be forever grateful for this... to both of you.
harry_potter I want to go with you.
sirius_black One day, perhaps. For some time my life will be too unpredictable. And besides, you're meant to be here.
harry_potter But, you're innocent.
sirius_black And you know it. And for now, that'll do.
hermione_granger Down, Buckbeak.
sirius_black I expect you're tired of hearing this... but you look so like your father. Except your eyes... you have
harry_potter My mother's eyes.
sirius_black It's cruel that I got to spend so much time with James and Lily, and you so little... But know this- the ones that love us never really leave us, and you can always find them... in here.
sirius_black You really are the brightest witch of your age. 
hermione_granger We have to go.
albus_dumbledore Well?
harry_potter He's free- we did it.
albus_dumbledore Did what? Good night.
ron_weasley How'd you get there? I was just talking to you there... and now you're there!
hermione_granger What's he talking about, Harry?
harry_potter I don't know. Honestly, Ron, how can somebody be in two places at once?
remus_lupin Hello, Harry. I saw you coming. I've looked worse, believe me.
harry_potter You've been sacked.
remus_lupin No. No, I resigned, actually.
harry_potter Resigned? Why?
remus_lupin Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want a, ahwell, someone like me teaching their children.
harry_potter But Dumbledore.
remus_lupin Dumbledore has already risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me are,... well... let's just say that I'm used to it by now. Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
harry_potter None of it made any difference. Pettigrew escaped.
remus_lupin Didn't make any difference? Harry, it made all the difference in the world. You helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. It made a great deal of difference. If I am proud of anything, it is of how much you have learned this year. Now, since I am no longer your teacher, I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. So now, I'll say goodbye, Harry. I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. Until then... mischief managed.
ron_weasley Stand back, I said! Or- or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle!
neville_longbottom Harry! Wherever did you get it!
seamus_finnigan Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course–
harry_potter What are you talking about?
ron_weasley Quiet! Let the man through.
ron_weasley I- I didn't mean to open it, Harry. It ah, i- ah- it was badly wrapped. They made me do it!
george_weasley Did not!
fred_weasley It's a Firebolt.
george_weasley It's the fastest broom in the world.
harry_potter For me? But, who sent it?
ron_weasley No one knows.
hermione_granger But this came with it.
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 Let's see what it will do!
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 ...has to win the Quidditch Cup now!
seamus_finnigan Go on, Harry.
neville_longbottom Yeah. Let's see.
other#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode03 How fast is it Harry?
harry_potter Whoaaaaahhhh! Ha ha!

not_available I don't know about you, it's just too hot today, isn't it?
not_available And it's going to get even worse.
not_available Temperatures up in the mid30s Celsius... that's the mid
not_available 90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.
not_available So, please, remember to cover up and stay cool... with the hottest hits on your FM dial.
not_available Come on, guys, time to go home.
not_available Come on, love, off you get.
not_available Do we have to?
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available I'll make you your favorite dinner to compensate.
dudleys_gang_member He squealed like a pig, didn't he?
not_available Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
not_available Did you see his face?
harry_potter Hey Big D. Beat up another 10 year old?
dudley_dursley This one deserved it.
harry_potter Five against one. That's very brave.
dudley_dursley Well you're one to talk, moaning in your sleep every night. At least I'm not afraid of my pillow. "Don't kill Cedric!" Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?
harry_potter Shut up.
dudley_dursley "He's going to kill me, Mum."
not_available Where is your mum?
not_available Where is your mum, Potter?
not_available She dead?
not_available Is she dead?
not_available Is she a dead Pott...?
dudleys_gang_member  Dudley.
not_available Dudley, let's go.
dudley_dursley What's going on?
not_available What are you doing?
harry_potter I'm not doing anything.
not_available We're getting out of here, Dudley.
not_available Come on, Dudley, hurry up.
not_available Dudley, run.
not_available Expecto Patronum.
not_available Mrs. Figg.
mrs_arabella_figg Don't put away your wand, Harry.
mrs_arabella_figg They might come back.
mrs_arabella_figg Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?
mrs_arabella_figg Whole world's gone topsyturvy. 
harry_potter I don't understand. How do you know...?
mrs_arabella_figg Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.
mrs_arabella_figg After YouKnow
mrs_arabella_figg Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year... did you expect him to let you go wandering on your own?
not_available Good Lord, boy. They told me you were intelligent.
not_available Now, get inside and stay there.
not_available Expect someone will be in touch soon.
not_available Whatever happens, don't leave the house.
not_available It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.
not_available There's sweat. There's stifling.
not_available Diddykins?
not_available Is that you?
not_available Duddy. Vernon, come quick.
not_available We're going to have to take him to a hospital.
not_available Who did this to you, boy?
not_available Happy, are we, now?
vernon_dursley Happy, are we, now? You've finally done it! You've finally driven him loopy!
petunia_dursley Vernon! Don't say that!
vernon_dursley Just look at him, Petunia! Our boy has gone yumpy!
vernon_dursley I've reached my limit, do you hear? This is the last I'm gonna take of you and your nonsense!
not_available Dear Mr. Potter.
not_available What?
not_available The Ministry has received intelligence that at 6:23 this evening... you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle.
not_available As a clear violation... of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery... you are hereby expelled... from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
not_available Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.
not_available Justice.
not_available He's not very well.
not_available Sorry, Hedwig.
not_available Very clean, these Muggles.
not_available Tonks, for God's sake.
not_available Unnatural.
not_available Professor Moody.
not_available What are you doing here?
not_available Rescuing you, of course.
not_available Kingsley, you take point.
harry_potter Where are we going? The letter said I had been expelled from Hogwarts.
alastor_moody Well, you haven't been. Not yet. Kingsley, you take point.
harry_potter But the letter said--
kingsley_shacklebolt Dumbledore has persuaded the Minister to suspend your expulsion pending a formal hearing.
harry_potter A hearing?
kingsley_shacklebolt Uh-huh.
nymphadora_tonks Don't worry, Harry. we'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters.
alastor_moody Sshh! Not here, Nymphadora!
nymphadora_tonks Don't- call me- Nymphadora!
alastor_moody Stay in formation everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed!
not_available Come on, you, around the corner.
not_available Come on.
not_available In you go, son.
not_available There've been no sightings.
not_available No deaths. No proof.
not_available He almost killed Harry. If that isn't proof enough...
not_available Yes, but guarding youknow
not_available what is the most important...
not_available We must trust Dumbledore on this.
not_available Was he able to protect Harry last year?
not_available Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.
not_available Cornelius Fudge is a politician first and a wizard second.
not_available His instinct would be to ignore it...
not_available Keep your voices down.
not_available He's getting stronger and stronger by the minute. We have to act now.
not_available Harry.
not_available Mrs. Weasley.
not_available Heavens, you're all right.
not_available Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait until after the meeting's finished.
not_available Nope. No time to explain. Straight upstairs, first door on the left.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.
not_available If my poor mistress knew the scum they let into her house... what would she say to old Kreacher?
not_available Oh, the shame.
not_available Freaks.
not_available There, there, mistress.
not_available Scum of the earth. Not like it was in the days of my fathers.
not_available Kreacher is here.
not_available Oh, Harry.
hermione_granger Oh, Harry!
hermione_granger Are you all right? We overheard them talking about the dementor attack. You must tell us everything.
ron_weasley Let the man breathe, Hermione.
hermione_granger And this hearing at the Ministry. It's just outrageous! I've looked it up, they simply can't expel you. It's completely unfair!
harry_potter There's a lot of that going around, Hermione. So what is this place?
ron_weasley Headquarters.
hermione_granger Of the Order of the Phoenix. It's a secret society. Dumbledore formed it back when they first fought You-Know-Who.
harry_potter You couldn't have put this in a letter, I suppose. I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.
ron_weasley We wanted to tell you, mate. Really, we did. Only...
harry_potter Only what?
hermione_granger Only Dumbledore made us swear that we wouldn't tell you anything.
harry_potter Dumbledore said that? But why would he want to keep me in the dark? Maybe I could help. After all, I'm the one who saw Voldemort return, I'm the one who fought him, I'm the one who saw Cedric Diggory get killed!
not_available Harry.
not_available Thought we heard your dulcet tones.
not_available Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
not_available If you're all done shouting...
not_available Do you wanna hear something a little more interesting?
sirius_black If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back. He's not a child, Molly!
molly_weasley He's not an adult either. He's not James, Sirius.
sirius_black He's not your son.
molly_weasley He's as good as. Who else has he got?
harry_potter Hey, Ginny.
sirius_black He's got me!
professor_severus_snape How touching and paternal, Black. Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather.
sirius_black Now you stay out of this, Snivellus.
harry_potter Snape's part of the Order?
ron_weasley Git.
sirius_black I don't care what Dumbledore says about your supposed reformation. I know better.
professor_severus_snape Why don't you tell him? Or are you afraid he won't take serious the word of a man hiding in his mother's house?
ron_weasley Hermione, I hate your cat.
hermione_granger Bad Crookshanks! Leave it alone.
not_available Get it up.
not_available Hermione, I hate your cat.
not_available Bad Crookshanks.
not_available Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.
not_available Just because you're allowed to use magic now... does not mean you have to whip your wands out for everything.
not_available Hi, Mum.
not_available You hungry, Harry?
not_available You sure you're all right, Harry? Gave us quite a turn.
not_available Harry Potter.
not_available Sirius.
arthur_weasley This is very, very peculiar. It seems that your hearing at the Minstry is to be before the entire Wizengamot.
harry_potter I don't understand, what's the Ministry of Magic got against me?
alastor_moody Show him. He'll find out soon enough.
sirius_black He's been attacking Dumbledore as well. Fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet, to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned.
harry_potter Why?
remus_lupin The Minister thinks Dumbledore's after his job.
harry_potter But that's insane. No one in their right mind could believe that Dumbledore--
remus_lupin Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind. It's been twisted and warped by fear. Now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry. The last time Voldemort gained power, he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear. Now he's returned and I'm afraid the Minister will do almost anything to avoid facing that terrifying truth.
sirius_black We think Voldemort wants to build up his army again. Fourteen years ago he had huge numbers at his command, not only witches and wizards but all sorts of dark creatures. He's been recruiting heavily and we've been attempting to do the same. But gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in. We believe Voldemort may be after something else--
alastor_moody Sirius--
sirius_black Something he didn't have last time.
harry_potter You mean, a weapon?
molly_weasley No! That's enough! He's just a boy! You tell him much more and you might as well induct him in the Order straight away!
harry_potter Good! I want to join! If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight!
not_available Harry.
not_available You are hereby expelled.
not_available Before the entire Wizengamot.
not_available Trains. Underground.
not_available Ingenious, these Muggles.
not_available Here we are.
not_available I've never used the visitors' entrance before. Should be fun.
not_available Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.
not_available Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons trading on the potions market.
not_available Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?
Dumbledore Is he daft, or is he dangerous?
not_available Morning, Arthur.
not_available Morning, Bob.
not_available Interdepartmental memos.
not_available We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.
not_available Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.
not_available They've changed the time of your hearing.
not_available When is it?
not_available In five minutes.
not_available Department of Mysteries.
not_available And I'm confident, minister, that you will do the right thing.
not_available Yes, but we must be...
not_available Remember, during the hearing, speak only when you're spoken to.
not_available Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.
not_available As the Muggles say, truth will out.
not_available Yes?
not_available I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.
not_available Good luck, Harry.
not_available Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August... into offenses committed by Harry James Potter... resident at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
Interrogators Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...
albus_dumbledore Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric... Brian... Dumbledore.
cornelius_fudge You, you got our message that the time and place of the hearing had been changed, did you?
albus_dumbledore I must have missed it. But by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. The charges?
cornelius_fudge The charges against the accused are as follows; that he did knowingly and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, produced a Patronus charm in the presence of a Muggle. Do you deny producing said Patronus?
harry_potter No, I--
cornelius_fudge And you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school while under the age of seventeen?
harry_potter Yes, but--
cornelius_fudge Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot--
harry_potter I was only doing it because of the Dementors!
amelia_bones Dementors? In Little Whinging?
cornelius_fudge That's quite clever. Muggles can't see Dementors, can they boy? Highly convenient.
harry_potter I'm not lying! There were two of them and if I hadn't--
cornelius_fudge Enough! I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well rehearsed story, but since you can produce no witnesses of the event--
albus_dumbledore Pardon me Minister, but as it happens, we can.
amelia_bones Please describe the attack. What did they look like?
mrs_arabella_figg Well one of them was very large, and the other rather skinny.
cornelius_fudge Not the boys, the Dementors!
mrs_arabella_figg Alright, right, well um, big. Cloaked. Then everything went cold, as though all the happiness had gone from the world.
cornelius_fudge Now look here, Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb and happen across a wizard, the odds are astronomical.
albus_dumbledore I don't think anyone would believe the Dementors were there by coincidence, Minister.
dolores_umbridge I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor. Dementors are after all under the control of the Ministry of Magic. So silly of me but it sounded, for a moment, as though you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy.
albus_dumbledore That would be disturbing indeed, Madame Undersecretary, which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry into why the two Dementors were so far away from Azkaban and why they mounted an attack without authorization. Of course, there is someone who might be behind the attack. Cornelius, I implore you to see reason. The evidence of the Dark Lord's return is incontrovertible.
cornelius_fudge He's not back!
albus_dumbledore In the matter of Harry Potter, the law clearly states that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations.
cornelius_fudge Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore!
albus_dumbledore Clearly, it has become practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of under-age magic.
amelia_bones Those in favor of conviction? Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?
cornelius_fudge Cleared of all charges.
not_available Professor.
not_available Padfoot. Are you barking mad?
not_available You'll blow the entire operation.
not_available Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you...
not_available I had to see you off, didn't I?
not_available What's life without a little risk?
not_available I don't wanna see you get chucked back in Azkaban.
not_available Don't worry about me.
not_available Anyway, I wanted you to have this.
not_available Original Order of the Phoenix.
not_available Marlene McKinnon.
not_available She was killed two weeks after this was taken.
not_available Voldemort wiped out her entire family.
not_available Frank and Alice Longbottom.
not_available Neville's parents.
not_available They suffered a fate worse than death, you ask me.
not_available It's been 14 years.
not_available And still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad.
not_available Do you really think there's going to be a war, Sirius?
not_available It feels like it did before.
not_available You keep it.
not_available Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.
not_available I'll see you at the train.
not_available Bye
not_available bye, darling.
not_available I love you.
not_available Hold my hand, lovey.
not_available There they are. They're in the far carriage.
not_available Bye.
draco_malfoy I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free, Potter. You better enjoy it while you can. I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it.
draco_malfoy What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
harry_potter JUST STAY AWAY FROM ME!
ron_weasley It's only Malfoy.
not_available What'd you expect?
not_available Hi, guys.
not_available Hey, Neville.
not_available Hey there, Neville.
not_available What is it?
harry_potter What is it?
ron_weasley What's what?
harry_potter That. Pulling the carriage.
hermione_granger Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry. It's pulling itself like always.
luna_lovegood You're not going mad. I see them too. You're just as sane as I am.
hermione_granger Everyone, this is Loony Love...
hermione_granger Luna Lovegood.
hermione_granger So... that's an interesting necklace.
luna_lovegood It's a charm actually. It keeps away the Nargles.
luna_lovegood Hungry. I hope they have pudding.
neville_longbottom What's a Nargle?
hermione_granger No idea.
not_available Good evening, children.
not_available Now, we have two changes in staffing this year.
not_available We're pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly
not_available Plank... who'll be taking Care of Magical Creatures... while Professor Hagrid is on temporary leave.
not_available We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... Professor Dolores Umbridge.
not_available And I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing the professor good luck.
not_available Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr.
not_available Filch, has asked me to remind you...
not_available She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.
dolores_umbridge Thank you, Headmaster, for those kind words of welcome. And how lovely to see all your bright happy faces smiling up at me. I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends.
fred_weasley@george_weasley That's likely.
dolores_umbridge The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizard of vital importance. Although each Headmaster has brought something new to this historic school... progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged. Let us preserve what must be preserved, perfect what can be perfected and prune practices that ought to be prohibited.
albus_dumbledore Thank you Professor Umbridge, that really was most illuminating.
ron_weasley Illuminating? What a load o' waffle!
not_available What's it mean?
not_available Magic is forbidden in the corridors...
not_available It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts.
harry_potter Dean, Seamus, good holiday?
dean_thomas Alright, better than Seamus' anyway.
seamus_finnigan Me mam didn't want me to come back this year.
harry_potter Why not?
seamus_finnigan Let me see, eh, because of you! The Daily Prophet's been sayin’ a lot of things about ya, Harry. And about Dumbledore as well.
harry_potter What, your mum believes them?
seamus_finnigan Well, nobody was there the night Cedric died.
harry_potter Oh, well, I guess you should read the Prophet then, like your stupid mother, it'll tell you everything you need to know!
seamus_finnigan Don't you dare talk about my mother like that!
harry_potter I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar!
ron_weasley What's going on?
seamus_finnigan He's mad, is what's goin’ on! Do you believe the rubbish he's comin’ out with about You-Know-Who?
ron_weasley Yeah, I do. Has anyone else got a problem with Harry? You alright?
harry_potter Fine.
ron_weasley Seamus was bang out of order, mate. But he'll come through. You'll see--
harry_potter I said I'm fine, Ron!
ron_weasley Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts then.
not_available Harry.
not_available Bring it over here. Over here.
not_available Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.
not_available Good morning, children.
not_available Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.
not_available OW
not_available Ls.
not_available More commonly known as OWLs.
not_available Study hard and you will be rewarded.
not_available Fail to do so, and the consequences may be severe.
dolores_umbridge Your previous instruction for this subject has been disturbingly uneven. But you will be pleased to know, from now on you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic. Yes?
hermione_granger There's nothing in here about using defensive spells.
dolores_umbridge Using spells? Why I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom.
ron_weasley We're not gonna use magic?
dolores_umbridge You'll be learning about defensive spells in a secure risk-free way.
harry_potter Well, what use is that? If we're gonna be attacked, it won't be risk-free.
dolores_umbridge Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class. It is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient to get you through your examinations, which after all is what school is all about!
harry_potter And how’s theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there?
dolores_umbridge There is nothing out there, dear. Who would you imagine would want to attack children like yourself?
harry_potter Oh, I don't know, maybe Lord Voldemort!
dolores_umbridge Now let me make this quite plain. You have been told that a certain Dark Wizard is at large once again. This... is... a... lie!
harry_potter It's not a lie! I saw him! I fought him!
dolores_umbridge DETENTION, Mr. Potter!
harry_potter So according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord.
dolores_umbridge Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.
harry_potter It was murder! Voldemort killed him! You must know!
dolores_umbridge ENOUGH! Enough. See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.
not_available Come in.
not_available Good evening, Mr. Potter.
not_available Sit.
dolores_umbridge You're going to be doing some lines for me, Mr. Potter.
dolores_umbridge No, not with your quill. You're going to be using a rather special one of mine. Now, I want you to write "I must not tell lies."
harry_potter How many times?
dolores_umbridge Let's see... As long as it takes for the message to sink in.
harry_potter You haven't given me any ink.
dolores_umbridge Oh, you won't need any ink.
not_available Yes?
not_available Nothing.
not_available That's right.
not_available Because you know, deep down... you deserve to be punished.
not_available Don't you, Mr. Potter?
not_available Go on.
not_available Skiving Snackboxes.
not_available Sweets that make you ill.
not_available Get out of class whenever you like.
not_available Obtain hours of pleasure from unprofitable boredom.
not_available Care for another?
not_available I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.
not_available I've been busy studying for these stupid OWL exams.
not_available I'll do the introduction. That's all.
not_available Hermione, you're honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met.
not_available And if I'm ever rude to you again...
not_available I'll know you've gone back to normal.
hermione_granger What's wrong with your hand?
harry_potter Nothing.
hermione_granger Your other hand. You've got to tell Dumbledore!
harry_potter No. Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now. Anyway, I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction.
ron_weasley Bloody hell, Harry, the woman's torturing you! If the parents knew about this-!
harry_potter Yeah, well, I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?
hermione_granger Harry, you've got to report this. It's perfectly simple - you're being-
harry_potter No, it's not. Hermione, whatever this, it's not simple. You don't understand.
hermione_granger Then help us to.
not_available Dear Padfoot... I hope you're all right.
not_available It's starting to get colder here.
not_available Winter is definitely on the way.
not_available In spite of being back at Hogwarts, I feel more alone than ever.
not_available I know you, of all people, will understand.
not_available Hello, Harry Potter.
luna_lovegood Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
harry_potter Bit.
not_available Unfortunately, all my shoes have mysteriously disappeared.
not_available I suspect Nargles are behind it.
not_available What are they?
luna_lovegood They're called Thestrals.
harry_potter They're quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they're a bit...
harry_potter Different.
harry_potter So why can't the others see them?
luna_lovegood They can only be seen by people who've seen death.
harry_potter So... you've known someone who's died?
luna_lovegood My mum. She was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment, and one day one of her spells went badly wrong. I was nine.
harry_potter I'm sorry.
luna_lovegood Yes, it was rather horrible. I do feel very sad about it sometimes. But I've got Dad. We both believe you, by the way. That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back and you fought him and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you and Dumbledore.
harry_potter Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do.
luna_lovegood I don't think that's true. But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.
harry_potter What do you mean?
luna_lovegood Well, if I were You-Know-Who, I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else. Because if it's just you alone, you're not as much of a threat.
 hermione_granger Do you ever stop eating?
ron_weasley What? I'm hungry. 
not_available Harry.
not_available Can I join you?
dolores_umbridge Pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating?
professor_minerva_mcgonagall I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students, you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices.
dolores_umbridge So silly of me but it sounds as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom, Minerva.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Not at all, Dolores. Merely your medieval methods.
dolores_umbridge I am sorry dear, but to question my practices is to question the Ministry and, by extension, the Minister himself. I am a tolerant woman, but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Disloyalty?
dolores_umbridge Things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared. Cornelius will want to take immediate action.
not_available What's happened to Dumbledore?
not_available Having already revolutionized... the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts... Dolores Umbridge will, as high inquisitor, have powers... to address the seriously falling standards at Hogwarts School.
not_available Just one question, dear.
not_available You've been in this post how long, exactly?
dolores_umbridge So, you applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct?
professor_severus_snape Yes.
dolores_umbridge But you were unsuccessful?
professor_severus_snape Obviously.
not_available Could you please predict something for me?
not_available I'm sorry?
not_available Move those mouths.
dolores_umbridge One teensy little prophecy?
dolores_umbridge Pity.
professor_sybil_trelawney No, wait! Wait! I think I do see something! Yes... I do! Something dark! You are in grave danger!
dolores_umbridge Lovely!
not_available Cho. What's going on?
not_available It's Professor Trelawney.
professor_sybil_trelawney Sixteen years I've lived and taught here! Hogwarts is my home! You can't do this!
dolores_umbridge Actually, I can. Something you'd like to say, dear?
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Oh, there are several things I would like to say!
albus_dumbledore Professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside?
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Sybil, dear, this way...
professor_sybil_trelawney Oh, thank you! Thank you!
dolores_umbridge Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms of Educational Decree #23, as enacted by the Minister...
albus_dumbledore You have the right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds - That power remains with the headmaster.
dolores_umbridge For now.
albus_dumbledore Don't you all have studying to do?
not_available Professor.
not_available Professor?
not_available Professor Dumbledore. Professor!
not_available Professor Dumbledore.
not_available That foul, evil, old gargoyle.
not_available We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
not_available We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.
not_available She's taking over the entire school.
not_available Security has been and will remain the Ministry's top priority.
not_available Furthermore, we have convincing evidence... that these disappearances are the work... of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.
not_available Harry.
not_available Sirius.
not_available What are you doing here?
not_available Answering your letter.
not_available You said you were worried about Umbridge. What's she doing?
not_available Training you to kill half
not_available breeds?
not_available She's not letting us use magic at all.
not_available Well, I'm not surprised.
sirius_black The latest intelligence is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat.
ron_weasley Combat? What does he think, that we're forming some sort of wizard army?
sirius_black That's exactly what he thinks. That Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry. He's becoming more paranoid by the minute. The others wouldn't want me telling you this, Harry, but things aren't going at all well with the Order. Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn, and these disappearances are just how it started before. Voldemort is on the move.
not_available Well, what can we do?
not_available Someone's coming.
not_available I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
not_available But for now, at least, it looks like you're on your own.
not_available He really is out there, isn't he?
not_available We've got to be able to defend ourselves.
not_available And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how, we need someone who will.
not_available Harry.
not_available This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?
not_available I'm a nutter, remember?
not_available Look on the bright 
side you can't be any worse than old toad face.
not_available Thanks, Ron.
not_available I'm here for you, mate.
not_available Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?
not_available Just a couple of people.
not_available Lovely spot.
not_available Thought it would be safer off the beaten track.
not_available Matey, come back here.
hermione_granger Um... Hi! You all know why we're here. We need a teacher. A proper teacher. One who's had real experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts.
somewhat_doubtful_boy_ Why?
ron_weasley Why. Because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot.
somewhat_doubtful_boy_ So he says.
hermione_granger So Dumbledore says.
somewhat_doubtful_boy_ So Dumbledore says because he says! The point is, where's the proof?
somewhat_doubtful_boy_ If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed...
harry_potter I'm not going to talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here you might as well clear out now. C'mon, Hermione, let's go. They're just here because they think I'm some sort of freak.
hermione_granger Harry, wait!
luna_lovegood Is it true you can produce a Patronus charm?
hermione_granger Yes. I've seen it.
dean_thomas Blimey, Harry! I didn't know you could do that!
neville_longbottom And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office.
ginny_weasley It's true.
ron_weasley Third year he fought off about a hundred dementors at once.
hermione_granger And last year he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh.
harry_potter Wait... look, it all sounds great when you say it like that. But the truth is most of that was just luck. I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I nearly always had help...
hermione_granger He's just being modest.
harry_potter No, Hermione, I'm not! Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake you can just try again tomorrow. But out there, when you're a second away from being murdered or watching a friend die right before your eyes... you don't know what that's like.
hermione_granger You're right, Harry, we don't. That's why we need your help. Because if we're having any chance against beating... Voldemort.
nigel He's really back?
harry_potter Right. 
harry_potter First we need to find a place to practice where Umbridge won't find out.
ginny_weasley The Shrieking Shack?
harry_potter It's too small.
hermione_granger Forbidden Forest?
ron_weasley Not bloody likely!
ginny_weasley Harry? What happens if Umbridge does find out?
hermione_granger Who cares? I mean, sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?
ron_weasley Who are you, and what have you done with Hermione ?
not_available Anyway, at least we know one positive thing that came from today.
not_available What's that?
not_available Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?
not_available Right. Over the next few days, we should each come up... with a couple of possibilities of places we can practice.
not_available We've got to make sure, wherever it is, there's no chance she can find us.
not_available Will do, Harry.
not_available All student organizations are henceforth disbanded.
not_available Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
not_available Watch where you're going, Longbottom.
hermione_granger You've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement.
ron_weasley The what?
hermione_granger It's also known as the Come and Go Room. The Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it, and is always equipped for the seeker's needs.
ron_weasley So, say you really needed the toilet...?
hermione_granger Charming, Ronald. But yes, that's the idea.
harry_potter It's brilliant! It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available I'm hopeless.
not_available You're just flourishing your wand too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.
not_available You will please copy the approved text four times... to ensure maximum retention.
not_available There will be no need to talk.
not_available No need to think's more like it.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Wands away.
not_available Stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal.
not_available It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.
not_available So come on, then, Nigel.
not_available Give it your best shot.
not_available Stupefy!
not_available Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.
ron_weasley Don't worry, I'll go easy on you.
hermione_granger Thanks, Ronald.
fred_weasley One Sickle.
george_weasley You're on.
fred_weasley Thank you.
george_weasley Shut up.
not_available I let her do that. It's good manners, isn't it?
not_available It was completely intentional.
not_available Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?
not_available Now, focus on a fixed point and try again.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Very good. Keep your concentration.
not_available Great.
not_available A little higher.
not_available I'm okay. I'm okay.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit... may sign up in the high inquisitor's office.
not_available Diminuendo.
not_available Working hard is important, but there's something that matters even 
more Believing in yourself.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Levicorpus. Got it.
not_available Think of it this way.
not_available Every great wizard in history has started out... as nothing more than what we are 
now students.
not_available If they can do it, why not us?
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Reducto.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.
not_available So that's it for this lesson.
not_available Now, we' re not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays.
not_available So just keep practicing on your own as best you can.
not_available And well done, everyone. Great, great work.
not_available Well done, mate.
not_available Thanks.
not_available See you after Christmas.
not_available See you in the Common Room, Harry.
not_available Thanks a lot, Harry.
not_available No worries.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Not at all. Merry Christmas.
not_available Thank you, Harry.
not_available Thank you. Merry Christmas.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Have a good Christmas.
not_available Have a great Christmas, Luna.
not_available We've been thinking.
not_available We could always slip Umbridge some Puking Pastilles.
not_available Or Fever Fudge. They give you massive, pus
not_available filled boils...
not_available Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?
harry_potter Are you alright? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day.
cho_chang Yeah, I'm okay. Anyway, it's worth it. It's just, just learning all this. Makes me wonder whether if he'd known it...
harry_potter Cedric, Cedric did know this stuff. He was really good. It's just, Voldemort was better.
cho_chang You're a really good teacher, Harry. I've never been able to stun anything before. Mistletoe.
harry_potter Probably full of Nargles, though.
cho_chang What are Nargles?
harry_potter No idea.
hermione_granger Well, how was it?
harry_potter Wet. Well, she was sort of... crying.
ron_weasley That bad at it, are you?
hermione_granger I'm sure Harry's kissing is more than satisfactory. Cho spends half her time crying these days.
ron_weasley Think a bit of snogging would cheer her up.
hermione_granger Don't you understand how she must be feeling? Well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric, and therefore confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him. Conflicted because Umbridge is threatening to sack her mother from her job at the Ministry and frightened of failing her O.W.L.'s because she's so busy worrying about everything else.
ron_weasley One person couldn't feel all that, they'd explode!
hermione_granger Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon... 
not_available Harry.
not_available Voldemort may be after something.
not_available Something he didn't have last time.
not_available Harry.
not_available Harry.
albus_dumbledore In the dream were you standing next to the victim, or looking down at the scene?
harry_potter Neither, I--It was like I--Professor, will you please just tell me what's happening?
albus_dumbledore Everard! Arthur is on guard duty tonight. Make sure he's found by the right people.
harry_potter Sir...
albus_dumbledore Phineas! You must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place. Tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured and his children will be arriving there soon, by Portkey.
everard They got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it. Once more the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.
albus_dumbledore Oh, thank goodness! Next we need to--
harry_potter LOOK AT ME! What's happening to me?
professor_severus_snape You wished to see me, Headmaster?
albus_dumbledore Oh Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning. Otherwise we'll all be vulnerable.
professor_severus_snape It appears there is a connection between the Dark Lord's mind and your own. Whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is for the moment unclear. Pray he remains ignorant.
harry_potter You mean if he knows about it then, he'll be able to read my mind?
professor_severus_snape Read it, control it, unhinge it. In the past it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure to invade the minds of his victims, creating visions designed to torture them into madness. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony, only when he had them literally begging for death would he finally kill them. Used properly, the power of Occlumency will help shield you from access or influence. In these lessons I will attempt to penetrate your mind. You will attempt to resist. Prepare yourself! Legilimens! Concentrate, Potter. Focus.
not_available Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Daddy's back.
not_available Sit down, everybody, sit down. That's it. Now, presents.
not_available And a nice big box for Ron.
not_available Big box for you. And...
not_available Fred and George. Come on, open up.
not_available I want to see your faces.
not_available Yes.
not_available Try it on.
not_available Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.
not_available Just what he wanted, actually.
not_available Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.
not_available Come on, then, everybody.
not_available Let's clear this away.
not_available Oh, Harry, Harry.
not_available There you are.
not_available Happy Christmas.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Lovely to have you with us.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Has everybody got?
not_available Fred? George?
not_available Hermione.
not_available A Christmas toast.
not_available To Mr. Harry Potter... without whom I would not be here.
not_available Harry.
not_available Harry.
not_available Harry.
not_available That is delicious. I shall be needing some more of that.
not_available Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.
not_available I can't understand why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.
not_available I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.
not_available No more than usual, Ron.
not_available I don't know why...
not_available Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.
not_available Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.
not_available Friend of Mudbloods and blood
not_available traitors alike.
not_available If my poor mistress only knew...
not_available Kreacher!
not_available That's enough of your bile. Away with you!
not_available Of course, master.
not_available Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available He never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy.
not_available Not to me, anyway.
not_available What, you grew up here?
not_available This is my parents' house.
not_available I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order.
not_available About the only useful thing I've been able to do.
not_available This is the Black family tree.
not_available My deranged cousin.
not_available I hated the lot of them.
not_available My parents with their pure
not_available blood mania.
not_available My mother did that after I ran away.
not_available Charming woman.
not_available I was 16.
not_available Where did you go?
not_available Round your dad's.
not_available I was always welcome at the Potters'.
not_available I see him so much in you, Harry.
not_available You are so very much alike.
not_available I'm not so sure.
not_available Sirius, when I was...
not_available When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching.
not_available I was the snake.
not_available And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office... there was a moment when I wanted to...
harry_potter This connection between me and Voldemort, what if the reason for it is that I'm becoming more like him? I just feel so... angry, all the time. And what if after everything I've been through, something's gone wrong inside me. What if I'm becoming bad?
sirius_black I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. You're not a bad person. You're a very good person, who bad things have happened to. You understand? Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We have all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the power we choose to act on. That's who we really are.
not_available Harry, time to go.
not_available When all this is over, we'll be a proper family.
not_available You'll see.
not_available Come on.
not_available Really?
not_available Harry. Harry.
not_available Hagrid's back.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I will say this one last time.
not_available I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.
not_available I told you. I've been away for me health.
not_available Your health?
not_available Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.
not_available Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh air must be difficult to come by.
not_available If I were you, I shouldn't get too used to being back.
not_available In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.
not_available This is top
not_available secret, right?
rubeus_hagrid Dumbledore sent me to parlay with the giants.
hermione_granger Giants?! You found them?
rubeus_hagrid Well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, you see?
not_available I tried to convince them to join the cause.
not_available But I wasn't the only one that was trying to win them over.
not_available Death Eaters?
not_available Yes.
not_available Trying to persuade them to join YouKnow
not_available Who.
not_available Did they?
not_available I gave them Dumbledore's message.
not_available Suppose some of them remember he was friendly to them. I suppose.
not_available And they did this to you?
not_available Not exactly, no.
not_available Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.
not_available It's changing out there.
not_available Just like last time.
not_available There's a storm coming, Harry.
not_available We'd all best be ready when she does.
not_available We have confirmed that 10 high
not_available security prisoners... in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape.
not_available And of course, the Muggle prime minister has been alerted to the danger.
not_available We strongly suspect... that the breakout was engineered... by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban... notorious mass murderer Sirius Black... cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.
not_available Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.
not_available He's gonna get us all killed just because he can't face the truth.
not_available Harry.
not_available I wanted to apologize.
not_available Now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don't add up.
not_available So, what I'm really trying to say is that I believe you.
not_available Neville?
neville_longbottom Fourteen years ago, a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange used the Cruciatus Curse on my parents. She tortured them for information, but they never gave in. I'm quite proud to be their son. But I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.
harry_potter We're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise.
not_available Make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember.
not_available Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.
not_available George, your turn now.
not_available Expecto Patronum.
not_available A full
not_available bodied Patronus is the most difficult to produce... but shield forms can also be equally useful against a variety of opponents.
not_available Wow, that was really good.
not_available Fantastic, Ginny.
not_available Just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused.
not_available So focus, Luna.
not_available Think of the happiest thing you can.
not_available Expecto Patronum.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available I know. It's good.
not_available This is really advanced stuff, guys. You're doing so well.
not_available Expecto Patronum.
not_available I'll make short work of this.
not_available Bombarda Maxima.
not_available Get them.
dolores_umbridge I've been watching them for weeks and see, Dumbledore's Army. Proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius. All your fear mongering about You-Know-Who never fooled us for a minute. We see your lies for what they were, a smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry.
albus_dumbledore Naturally.
harry_potter No, professor! He had nothing to do with it, it was me!
albus_dumbledore Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as it's been pointed out the parchment clearly says "Dumbledore's Army", not "Potter's". I instructed Harry to form this organization and I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities.
cornelius_fudge Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet. If we hurry we can still make the front page. Dawlish, Shacklebolt! You will escort Dumbledore to Azkaban, to await trial for conspiracy and sedition...
albus_dumbledore Ah, I thought we might hit this little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion I am going to - what was the phrase, "Come quietly"? Well I can tell you this: I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
dolores_umbridge Enough of this! Take him!
kingsley_shacklebolt Whoo! You may not like him, Minister, but you can't deny - Dumbledore's got style!
not_available Boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other.
not_available Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
not_available Students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities.
not_available Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
not_available Harry.
ron_weasley You did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.
hermione_granger Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming. Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.
ron_weasley Yeah, we talked you into it...
harry_potter Yeah, but I agreed. I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is made things worse. Anyway, it doesn't matter anymore, because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much - The more you care, the more you have to lose. Maybe, it's just best to...
hermione_granger To what?
harry_potter To go it alone.
not_available Hagrid.
not_available Any idea where he's taking us?
not_available Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?
not_available I've never seen the centaurs so riled.
not_available And they're dangerous at the best of times.
not_available The Ministry restricts their territory much more... they'll have a full uprising on their hands.
not_available Hagrid, what's going on?
not_available I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.
not_available I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it, but with Dumbledore gone... I'll likely be getting the sack any day now.
not_available And I just couldn't leave without telling someone about him.
not_available Grawpy.
not_available Down here, you great buffoon.
not_available Grawpy.
not_available Brought you some company.
not_available I couldn't just leave him, because...
not_available Because he's my brother.
not_available Blimey.
not_available Well, half brother, really.
not_available He's completely harmless, just like I said. Little high
not_available spirited, is all.
not_available Grawpy, that is not polite.
not_available Hagrid, do something.
not_available We talked about this. You do not grab, do you?
not_available That's your new friend, Hermione.
not_available Grawpy.
not_available Grawp.
not_available Put me down!
not_available Now!
not_available You all right?
not_available Fine.
not_available Just needs a firm hand, is all.
not_available I think you've got an admirer.
not_available You just stay away from her, all right?
not_available He gets his own food and all.
not_available It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.
not_available You will look after him, won't you?
not_available I'm the only family he's got.
professor_severus_snape Feeling sentimental?
harry_potter That's private.
professor_severus_snape Not to me. And not to the Dark Lord if you don't improve. Every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you. You won't last two seconds if he invades your mind. You're just like your father. Lazy, arrogant.
harry_potter Don't say a word against my father!
professor_severus_snape Weak.
harry_potter I'm not weak!
professor_severus_snape Then prove it! Control your emotions. Discipline your mind. Legilimens!
harry_potter Sirius.
professor_severus_snape I may vomit.
harry_potter Stop that!
professor_severus_snape Is that what you call control?
harry_potter We've been at it for hours. If I could just rest!
professor_severus_snape The Dark Lord isn't resting. You and Black, you're two of a kind, sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been. Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair. Your blessed father knew that, in fact he frequently saw to it!
harry_potter My father was a great man!
professor_severus_snape Your father was a swine! Legilimens!
harry_potter Protego!
young_james_potter Come on, Moony! Padfoot! Snape! Expelliarmus!
young_sirius_blackr Nice one, James!
marauder#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode05 Come on, James, finish him off!
harry_potter Dad?
young_james_potter Impedimenta! Right, who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers?
professor_severus_snape Enough.  Your lessons are at an end.
harry_potter I didn't mean--
professor_severus_snape Get...out.
not_available What's your name?
not_available Michael.
not_available Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.
not_available Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?
not_available It's fading already.
not_available You can hardly see ours anymore, and the pain stops after a while.
not_available As I told you once before, Mr. Potter... naughty children deserve to be punished.
not_available You know, George... I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement.
not_available Fred, I've been thinking exactly the same thing.
not_available All right, professor!
not_available Here you go.
not_available Ready when you are.
lord_voldemort I need that prophecy.
sirius_black You'll have to kill me.
lord_voldemort Oh I will, but first you will fetch it for me. Crucio! Crucio!
not_available Sirius.
hermione_granger Harry, are you sure?
harry_potter I saw it! It's just like with Mr. Weasley! It's the same door I've been dreaming about for months, only I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before! Sirius said Voldemort was after something, something he didn't have last time, and it's in the department of Mysteries!
hermione_granger Harry, please just listen! What if Voldemort meant for you to see this? What if he's only hurting Sirius because he's trying to get to you?
harry_potter What if he is? I'm supposed to just let him die? Hermione, he's the only family I've got left!
not_available What do we do?
not_available We'll have to use the Floo Network.
not_available Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.
not_available Not all of them.
not_available Alohomora.
harry_potter Alert the Order if you can.
ron_weasley Are you mental? We're going with you!
harry_potter It's too dangerous.
hermione_granger When are you going to get it into your head?! We're in this together!
dolores_umbridge That you are!
not_available Caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl.
not_available You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?
not_available No.
not_available Liar.
professor_severus_snape You sent for me, Headmistress?
dolores_umbridge Snape, yes. The time has come for answers, whether they want to give them to me or not. Have you brought the Veritaserum?
professor_severus_snape I'm afraid you used up all my stores, interrogating students. The last of it on Ms. Chang. Unless you wish to poison him - and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy if you did - I cannot help you.
harry_potter He's got Padfoot. He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden.
dolores_umbridge Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What is he talking about, Snape?
professor_severus_snape No idea.
dolores_umbridge Very well. You give me no choice, Potter. As this is a matter of Ministry Security, you leave me with... no other alternative. The Cruiciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue.
hermione_granger That's illegal.
dolores_umbridge What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.
hermione_granger Tell her, Harry!
dolores_umbridge Tell me what?
hermione_granger Well, if you won't tell her where it is, I will.
dolores_umbridge Where what is?
hermione_granger Dumbledore's secret weapon.
not_available How much further?
not_available Not far.
not_available It had to be somewhere students wouldn't find it accidentally.
not_available What are you doing?
not_available Improvising.
not_available Well?
not_available Where is this weapon?
not_available There isn't one, is there?
not_available You were trying to trick me.
not_available You know... I really hate children.
dolores_umbridge You have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter. Lower your weapons! I warn you! Under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence--  Protego! How dare you! Filthy halfbreed! Incarcerous!
hermione_granger Please, please stop it! Please!
dolores_umbridge NO, ENOUGH! I will have order! YOU FILTHY ANIMAL! DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?!
hermione_granger Leave him alone! It's not his fault! He doesn't understand!
dolores_umbridge Potter, do something! Tell them I mean no harm!
harry_potter I'm sorry, Professor. But I must not tell lies.
dolores_umbridge WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge! LET... ME... GOOOOOOOOOOO!
hermione_granger Thank you, Grawp.
not_available Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.
hermione_granger How did you get away?
ginny_weasley Puking Pastilles, it wasn't pretty.
ron_weasley I told them I was hungry and wanted some sweets. Of course they told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves.
hermione_granger That was clever, Ron!
ron_weasley It's been known to happen.
neville_longbottom It was brilliant. So, how are we getting to London?
harry_potter Look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you. But, I've got you into enough trouble as it is.
neville_longbottom Dumbledore's Army was supposed to be about doing something real. Or was all that just words to you?
ron_weasley Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate.
harry_potter So, how are we going to get to London?
luna_lovegood We fly, of course.
not_available Department of Mysteries.
not_available This is it.

not_available five.
not_available He should be here.
not_available Harry.
not_available It's got your name on it.
not_available The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
not_available And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal... but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not.
professor_sybil_trelawney The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... and the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not... For neither can live while the other s-survives.
not_available Harry.
harry_potter Where's Sirius?
lucius_malfoy You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams... and reality. You only saw what the Dark Lord wanted you to see. Now hand me the prophecy.
harry_potter You do anything to us, I'll break it.
bellatrix_lestrange He knows how to play! Itty, bitty, baby, Potter!
neville_longbottom Bellatrix Lestrange.
bellatrix_lestrange Neville Longbottom, is it? How's mum and dad?
neville_longbottom Better, now they're about to be avenged!
lucius_malfoy Let's everybody just... calm down, shall we? All we want is that prophecy.
harry_potter Why did Voldemort need me to come and get this?
bellatrix_lestrange You dare speak his name? You filthy half-blood!
lucius_malfoy It's all right, he's just a curious lad, aren't you? Prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made. Which is lucky for you, really. Haven't you always wondered what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord, hmm? Why he was unable to kill you, when you were just an infant? Don't you want to know the secret of your scar? All the answers are there, Potter, in your hand. All you have to do... is give it to me, and I can show you everything.
harry_potter I've waited fourteen years.
lucius_malfoy I know.
harry_potter I guess I can wait a little longer. NOW!
Harry, Ron, Neville, Ginny, Hermione, and luna_lovegood STUPEFY!
not_available Levicorpus.
not_available Petrificus Totalus.
not_available Well done, Neville.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Reducto.
not_available Get back to the door.
not_available Department of Mysteries. They got that bit right, didn't they?
not_available The voices.
not_available Can you tell what they're saying?
not_available There aren't any voices, Harry.
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available I hear them too.
not_available Harry, it's just an empty archway.
not_available Please, Harry.
not_available Get behind me.
lucius_malfoy Did you actually believe, or were you truly naive enough to think that children stood a chance, against us? I'll make this simple for you, Potter. Give me the prophecy now, or watch your friends die.
neville_longbottom Don't give it to him, Harry!
bellatrix_lestrange Sst!
sirius_black Get away from my godson.
not_available Now, listen to me. Take the others and get out of here.
not_available What? No, I'm staying with you.
not_available You've done beautifully.
not_available Now, let me take it from here.
not_available Black.
not_available Expelliarmus!
not_available Nice one, James.
not_available Avada Kedavra.
not_available No. No.
bellatrix_lestrange I killed Sirius Black! You coming to get me?!
harry_potter CRUCIO!
lord_voldemort You've got to mean it, Harry. She killed him. She deserves it. You know the spell, Harry. Do it! So weak.
albus_dumbledore It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom. The Aurors are on their way.
lord_voldemort By which time I shall be gone. And you... shall be dead.
harry_potter You... you've lost, old man!
albus_dumbledore Harry.
lord_voldemort So weak! So vulnerable! Look at me!
albus_dumbledore Harry, it isn't how you are alike. It's how you are not. Harry.
harry_potterYou're the weak one. And you'll never know love, or friendship. And I feel sorry for you.
lord_voldemort You're a fool, Harry Potter. And you will lose everything.
cornelius_fudge He's back!
albus_dumbledore I know how you feel, Harry.
harry_potter No, you don't. It's my fault.
albus_dumbledore No, the fault is mine. I knew it was only a matter of time before Voldemort made the connection between you. I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year, he'd be less tempted and therefore you might be more protected.
harry_potter The prophecy said: neither one can live for the other one survives. It means one of us is gonna have to kill the other... in the end?
albus_dumbledore Yes.
harry_potter Why didn't you tell me?
albus_dumbledore For the same reason you tried to save Sirius. For the same reason your friends saved you. After all these years, after all you suffered, I didn't want to cause you any more pain. I cared too much about you.
harry_potter How come you're not at the feast?
luna_lovegood Lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.
harry_potter That's awful.
luna_lovegood Oh, it's all good fun. But as it's the last night, I really do need them back. I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.
harry_potter Are you sure you don't want any help looking?
luna_lovegood That's alright. Anyway, my mum always said, things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end... 
not_available If not always in the way we expect.
not_available Think I'll just go have some pudding.
harry_potter I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
hermione_granger What's that?
harry_potter That even though we got a fight ahead of us, we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
ron_weasley Yeah?
harry_potter Something worth fighting for.

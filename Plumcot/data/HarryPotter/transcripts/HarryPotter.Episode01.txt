rubeus_hagrid Gringotts , the Wizard Bank .
rubeus_hagrid T'aint
rubeus_hagrid no place safer , 'cept perhaps Hogwarts .
harry_potter Uh , hagrid , what exactly are those things ?
rubeus_hagrid They're goblins , harry .
rubeus_hagrid Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts .
rubeus_hagrid Best stick close to me .
rubeus_hagrid Mr . harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal .

rubeus_hagrid Oh , and there's something else as well .
rubeus_hagrid Professor dumbledore gave me this .
rubeus_hagrid It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which .
goblin_bank_teller#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode01 Very well .
griphook Vault 687 .

rubeus_hagrid Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing , now didja ?
griphook Vault 713 .

rubeus_hagrid Run along there , but wait .
rubeus_hagrid I just got one more thing I got to do .
rubeus_hagrid Won't be long .
harry_potter Hello ?
harry_potter Hello ?
ollivander I wondered when I'd be seeing you , Mr . Potter .
ollivander It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands .
ollivander Well , give it a wave .
harry_potter Oh !
ollivander Apparently not .
ollivander Curious , very curious .
harry_potter Sorry , but what's curious ?
ollivander I remember every wand I've ever sold , Mr . Potter .
ollivander It just so happens that the phoenix , whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather , just one .
ollivander It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar .
harry_potter And ...who owned that wand ?
ollivander Oh , we do not speak his name .
ollivander The wand chooses the wizard , Mr . Potter .
ollivander It's not always clear why , but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you .
ollivander After all , He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things ...terrible , yes , but great .
rubeus_hagrid harry !
rubeus_hagrid harry !
rubeus_hagrid Happy birthday !
harry_potter Wow .

harry_potter The one who gave me this .
harry_potter You know , hagrid , I know you do .
rubeus_hagrid First , and understand this , harry , 'cause it's very important .
rubeus_hagrid Not all wizards are good .
rubeus_hagrid Some of them go bad .
rubeus_hagrid A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go .
rubeus_hagrid And his name was V- ...
rubeus_hagrid his name was V- ...
harry_potter Maybe if you wrote it down ?
rubeus_hagrid No , I can't spell it .
rubeus_hagrid all right .
rubeus_hagrid His name was voldemort .
harry_potter voldemort ?
rubeus_hagrid Shh! !
rubeus_hagrid It was dark times , harry , dark times .
rubeus_hagrid voldemort started to gather some followers , brought 'em over to the dark side .
rubeus_hagrid Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead .
rubeus_hagrid Your parents fought against him , but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em .
harry_potter Me ?
harry_potter voldemort tried to kill ...me ?
rubeus_hagrid Yes .
rubeus_hagrid That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead , harry .
rubeus_hagrid A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse ...and an evil curse at that .
harry_potter What happened to Vo- ...
harry_potter to You
harry_potter -Know
harry_potter -Who ?
rubeus_hagrid Some say he died .
rubeus_hagrid Codswallop in my opinion .
rubeus_hagrid Nope , I reckon he's out there , still , too tired to go on .
rubeus_hagrid But one thing's absolutely certain .
rubeus_hagrid Something about you stumped him that night .
rubeus_hagrid That's why you're famous , harry .
rubeus_hagrid That's why everbody knows your name .
rubeus_hagrid You're the boy who lived .
rubeus_hagrid What're you looking at ?

ron_weasley Whew , amazing , can you imagine the look on old mcgonagall's face if we were late ?
ron_weasley That was bloody brilliant .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Thank you for that assessment , Mr . Weasley .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr . Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch , maybe one of you would be on time .
harry_potter We got lost .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Then perhaps a map ?
professor_minerva_mcgonagall I trust you don't need one to find your seats .
professor_severus_snape There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class .
professor_severus_snape As such , I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making .
professor_severus_snape However , for those select few Then again , maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not ...pay ...attention .
professor_severus_snape Mr . Potter .
professor_severus_snape Our ...new ...celebrity .
professor_severus_snape Tell me , what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood ?
harry_potter I don't know , Sir .

seamus_finnigan neville's got a Remembrall !
hermione_granger I've read about those .
hermione_granger When the smoke turns red , it means you've forgotten something .
neville_longbottom The only problem is , I can't remember what I've forgotten .
harry_potter Hey , ron , somebody broke into Gringotts .
harry_potter Listen , Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown , Gringotts goblins , while acknowledging the breach , insist that nothing was taken .
harry_potter The vault in question , number 713 , had in fact been emptied earlier that same day .

george_weasley Rough game , Quidditch .
fred_weasley Brutal .
fred_weasley But no one's died in years .
fred_weasley Someone will vanish occasionally ...
george_weasley But they'll turn up in a month or two! !
ron_weasley Oh , go on , harry , Quidditch is great .
ron_weasley Best game there is !
ron_weasley And you'll be great , too !
harry_potter But I've never even played Quidditch .
harry_potter What if I make a fool of myself ?
hermione_granger You won't make a fool of yourself .
hermione_granger It's in your blood .
ron_weasley Whoa .
ron_weasley harry , you never told me your father was a Seeker , too .
harry_potter I-I didn't know .
ron_weasley I'm telling you , it's spooky .
ron_weasley She knows more about you than you do .
harry_potter Who doesn't ?
ron_weasley Ahh !
harry_potter What's happening ?
hermione_granger The staircases change , remember ?
harry_potter Let's go this way .
ron_weasley Before the staircase moves again .
harry_potter Does anyone feel like ...we shouldn't be here ?
hermione_granger We're not supposed to be here .
hermione_granger This is the 3rd floor .
hermione_granger It's forbidden .

ron_weasley It's filch's cat !
harry_potter Run !
harry_potter It's locked !

ron_weasley Probably thinks this door's locked .
hermione_granger It was locked .
harry_potter And for good reason .
all@ AHHHHHHH !
ron_weasley What do they think they're doing? ?
ron_weasley Keeping a thing like that
ron_weasley locked up in a school .
hermione_granger You don't use your eyes , do you ?
hermione_granger Didn't you see what it was standing on ?
ron_weasley I wasn't looking at its feet !
ron_weasley I was a bit preoccupied with its heads .
ron_weasley Or maybe you didn't notice , there were three !
hermione_granger It was standing on a trap door .
hermione_granger Which means it wasn't there by accident .
hermione_granger It's guarding something .
harry_potter Guarding something ?
hermione_granger That's right .
hermione_granger Now , if you two don't mind , I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed ...or worse , expelled !
ron_weasley She needs to sort out her priorities !
oliver_wood Quidditch is easy enough to understand .
oliver_wood Each time has seven players , 3 chasers , 2 beaters , 1 keeper and a seeker that's you .
oliver_wood There are three kinds of balls .
oliver_wood With me so far ?
oliver_wood ...
oliver_wood You better take this .
harry_potter I like this ball .
oliver_wood Ah , you like it now .
oliver_wood Just wait .

harry_potter She doesn't know !
harry_potter He's going into the girl's Bathroom !

professor_minerva_mcgonagall E-Explain yourselves , both of you !
ron_weasley@harry_potter Well , what it is ...
hermione_granger It's my fault , Professor mcgonagall .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Ms .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Granger ?
hermione_granger I went looking for the troll .
hermione_granger I'd read about them and thought I could handle it .
hermione_granger But I was wrong .
hermione_granger If harry and ron hadn't come and found me ...
hermione_granger I'd probably be dead .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Be that as it may ...
professor_minerva_mcgonagall it was an extremely foolish thing to do .
professor_quirinus_quirrell Perhaps you ought to go ...
professor_quirinus_quirrell M-might wake up ...
professor_quirinus_quirrell heh .
professor_quirinus_quirrell Ahh !
professor_quirinus_quirrell Hehe ... .
ron_weasley Take a bit of toast , mate , go on .
hermione_granger ron's right , harry .
hermione_granger You're gonna need your strength today .
harry_potter I'm not hungry .
professor_severus_snape Good luck today , Potter .
professor_severus_snape Then again , now that you've proven yourself against a troll , a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you ...
professor_severus_snape even if it is against Slytherin .
harry_potter That explains the blood .
hermione_granger Blood ?
harry_potter Listen , last night , I'm guessing snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog .
harry_potter But , he got himself bitten , that's why he's limping .
hermione_granger But why would anyone go near that dog ?
harry_potter The day I was at Gringotts , hagrid took something out of one of the vaults .
harry_potter He said it was Hogwarts' business , very secret .
hermione_granger So you're saying ...
harry_potter That's what the dog's guarding .
harry_potter That's what snape wants .
hermione_granger Bit early for mail , isn't it ?
harry_potter But I-I never get mail .
ron_weasley Let's open it .
harry_potter It's a broomstick !
ron_weasley Thats not just any broomstick , harry .
ron_weasley It's a Nimbus 2000 !
harry_potter But who ... ?
oliver_wood Scared , harry ?
harry_potter A little bit .
oliver_wood That's all right .
oliver_wood I felt the same way before my first game .
harry_potter What happened ?
oliver_wood Er , I don't really remember .
oliver_wood I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in .
oliver_wood Woke up in the hospital a week later .

rubeus_hagrid Nonsense .
rubeus_hagrid Why would snape put a curse on harry's broom ?
harry_potter Who knows .
harry_potter Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween ?
rubeus_hagrid Who told you 'bout Fluffy ?
ron_weasley Fluffy ?
hermione_granger That thing has a name ?
rubeus_hagrid Well , of course he's got a name .

rubeus_hagrid Don't ask any more questions .
rubeus_hagrid That's top secret , that is .
harry_potter But hagrid , whatever Fluffy's guarding , snape's trying to steal it !
rubeus_hagrid Codswallop .
rubeus_hagrid Professor snape is a Hogwarts teacher .
hermione_granger Hogwarts teacher or not , I know a curse when I see one .
hermione_granger I've read all about them .
hermione_granger You have to keep eye contact .
hermione_granger And snape wasn't blinking .
harry_potter Exactly .
rubeus_hagrid Now , you listen to me , all three of you .
rubeus_hagrid You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in .
rubeus_hagrid It's dangerous .
rubeus_hagrid What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel .
harry_potter Nicholas Flamel ?
rubeus_hagrid I shouldn't have said that .
rubeus_hagrid I should not have said that .
rubeus_hagrid I should not have said that .
harry_potter Nicholas Flamel ...
harry_potter Who's Nicholas Flamel ?
hermione_granger I don't know .

albus_dumbledore But remember this , harry .
albus_dumbledore This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth .
albus_dumbledore Men have wasted away in front of it , even gone mad .
albus_dumbledore That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home , and I must ask you not to go looking for it again .
albus_dumbledore It does not do to dwell on dreams , harry , and forget to live .
hermione_granger I had you looking in the wrong section !
hermione_granger How could I be so stupid ?
hermione_granger I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading .
ron_weasley This is light ?
hermione_granger Of course !
hermione_granger Here it is ! "
hermione_granger Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone! "
ron_weasley The what ?
hermione_granger Honestly , don't you two read ? "
hermione_granger The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers .
hermione_granger It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life , which will make the drinker immortal . "
ron_weasley Immortal ?
hermione_granger It means you'll never die .
ron_weasley I know what it means !
harry_potter Shh !
hermione_granger "
hermione_granger The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr .
hermione_granger Nicholas Flamel , the noted alchemist , who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!
hermione_granger "
hermione_granger That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor .
hermione_granger That's what's under the trapdoor ...
hermione_granger the Philosopher's Stone !
harry_potter hagrid !

rubeus_hagrid Oh .

rubeus_hagrid snape ?
rubeus_hagrid Blimey , harry , you're not still on about him , are you ?
harry_potter hagrid , we know he's after the Stone .
harry_potter We just don't know why .
rubeus_hagrid snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone !
rubeus_hagrid He's not about to steal it !
harry_potter What ?
rubeus_hagrid You heard .
rubeus_hagrid Right .
rubeus_hagrid Come on , now , I'm a bit preoccupied today .
harry_potter Wait a minute .
harry_potter One of the teachers ?
hermione_granger Of course !
hermione_granger There are other things defending the Stone , aren't there ?
hermione_granger Spells , enchantments .
rubeus_hagrid That's right .
rubeus_hagrid Waste of bloody time , if you ask me .
harry_potter Uh , hagrid , what exactly is that ?
rubeus_hagrid That ?
rubeus_hagrid It's a ...
rubeus_hagrid its um ...
ron_weasley I know what that is !
ron_weasley But hagrid , how did you get one ?
rubeus_hagrid I won it .
rubeus_hagrid Off a stranger I met down at a pub .
rubeus_hagrid Seemed quite glad to be rid off it , as a matter of fact .
hermione_granger Is that ...a dragon ?
ron_weasley That's not just a dragon .
ron_weasley That's a Norwegian Ridgeback !
ron_weasley My brother Charlie works with these in Romania .
rubeus_hagrid Isn't he beautiful ?
rubeus_hagrid Oh .
rubeus_hagrid Bless him , look .
rubeus_hagrid He knows his mummy .
rubeus_hagrid Hehe .
rubeus_hagrid Hallo , Norbert .
harry_potter Norbert ?
rubeus_hagrid Yeah , well , he's got to have a name , doesn't he ?
rubeus_hagrid Don't you , Norbert ?
rubeus_hagrid Dededede .
rubeus_hagrid Ohh !
rubeus_hagrid Oooh , ooh , ooh
rubeus_hagrid , well ...he'll have to be trained up a bit , of course .
harry_potter Malfoy .
rubeus_hagrid Oh , dear .
harry_potter hagrid always wanted a dragon .
harry_potter He told me so the first time I met him .
ron_weasley It's crazy .
ron_weasley And worse , Malfoy knows .
harry_potter I don't understand .
harry_potter Is that bad ?
ron_weasley It's bad .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Good evening .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Nothing , I repeat , nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Therefore , as punishment for your actions , 50 points will be taken .
harry_potter 50? !
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Each .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall And to ensure it doesn't happen again , all four of you will receive detention .
draco_malfoy Excuse me , Professor .
draco_malfoy Perhaps I heard you wrong .
draco_malfoy I thought you said ... " the four of us .
draco_malfoy "
professor_minerva_mcgonagall No , you heard me correctly , Mr . Malfoy .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall You see , as honorable as your intentions were , you too were out of bed after hours .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall You will serve detention with your classmates .
argus_filch A pity they let the old punishments die .
argus_filch There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons .
argus_filch God , I miss the screaming .
argus_filch A sorry lot this , hagrid .
argus_filch Oh , good God , man , you're not still on about that bloody dragon , are you ?
rubeus_hagrid Norbert's gone .
rubeus_hagrid dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony .
hermione_granger Well , that's good , isn't it ?
hermione_granger He'll be with his own kind .
rubeus_hagrid Yeah ,
rubeus_hagrid but what if he don't like Romania ?
rubeus_hagrid What if the other dragons are mean to him ?
rubeus_hagrid He's only a baby , after all .
argus_filch Oh , for Gods sake , pull yourself together , man .
argus_filch You're going into the forest , after all .
argus_filch Got to have your wits about you .
draco_malfoy The forest ?
draco_malfoy I thought that was a joke !
draco_malfoy We can't go in there .
draco_malfoy students aren't allowed .
draco_malfoy And there are ... ...
draco_malfoy werewolves !
argus_filch There's more than werewolves in those trees , lad .
argus_filch You can be sure of that .
rubeus_hagrid Right .
rubeus_hagrid Let's go .
harry_potter hagrid , what's that ?
rubeus_hagrid What we're here for .
rubeus_hagrid See that ?
rubeus_hagrid That's unicorn's blood , that is .
rubeus_hagrid I found one dead a few weeks ago .
rubeus_hagrid Now , this one's been injured bad by something .
rubeus_hagrid So , it's our job to find the poor beast .
rubeus_hagrid ron , hermione , you'll come with me .
ron_weasley Okay .
rubeus_hagrid And harry , you'll go with Malfoy .
draco_malfoy Okay .
draco_malfoy Then I get Fang !
rubeus_hagrid Fine .
rubeus_hagrid Just so you know , he's a bloody coward .
draco_malfoy You wait till my father hears about this .
draco_malfoy This is servant's stuff .
harry_potter If I didn't know better , draco , I'd say you were scared .
draco_malfoy Scared , Potter? !
draco_malfoy Did you hear that ?
draco_malfoy Come on , Fang .
draco_malfoy Scared .
harry_potter What is it , Fang ?
draco_malfoy HELP!!!! !
firenze harry Potter , you must leave .
firenze You are known to many creatures here .
firenze The forest is not safe at this time .
firenze Especially for you .
harry_potter But what was that thing you saved me from ?
firenze A monstrous creature .
firenze It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn .
firenze Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death .
firenze But at a terrible price .
firenze You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips , you will have a half-life .
firenze A cursed life .
harry_potter But who would choose such a life ?
firenze Can you think of no one ?
harry_potter Do you mean to say ...that that thing that killed the unicorn ...that was drinking its blood ...
harry_potter that was voldemort ?
firenze Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment ?
harry_potter The Philosopher's Stone .
hermione_granger harry !
rubeus_hagrid Hello there , firenze .
rubeus_hagrid I see you've met our young Mr . Potter .
rubeus_hagrid You all right there , harry ?
firenze harry Potter , this is where I leave you .
firenze You're safe now .
firenze Good luck .
hermione_granger You mean , You-Know-
hermione_granger Who's out there , right now , in the forest ?
harry_potter But he's weak .
harry_potter He's living off the unicorns .
harry_potter Don't you see ?
harry_potter We had it wrong .
harry_potter snape doesn't want the stone for himself , he wants the stone for voldemort .
harry_potter With the Elixir of Life , voldemort will be strong again .
harry_potter He'll
harry_potter He'll come back .
ron_weasley But if he comes back , you don't think he'll try to kill you , do you ?
harry_potter I think if he'd had the chance , he might have tried to kill me tonight .
ron_weasley And to think , I've been worrying about my Potions final !
hermione_granger Hang on a minute .
hermione_granger We're forgetting one thing .
hermione_granger Who's the one wizard voldemort always feared ?
hermione_granger I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful , but I found that rather enjoyable .
ron_weasley Speak for yourself .
ron_weasley all right there , harry ?
harry_potter My scar .
harry_potter It keeps burning .
hermione_granger It's happened before .
harry_potter Not like this .
ron_weasley Perhaps you should see the nurse .
harry_potter I think it's a warning .
harry_potter It means dangers coming .
harry_potter Uhh !
hermione_granger What is it ?
harry_potter Don't you think it's a bit odd that what hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon , and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one
harry_potter ?
harry_potter What did he look like ?
rubeus_hagrid I don't know .
rubeus_hagrid I never saw his face .
rubeus_hagrid He kept his hood up .
harry_potter The stranger , though , you and he must have talked .
rubeus_hagrid Well , he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after .
rubeus_hagrid I told him .
rubeus_hagrid I said , " After Fluffy , a dragon's gonna be no problem . "
harry_potter And did he seem interested in Fluffy ?
rubeus_hagrid Well , of course he was interested in Fluffy !
rubeus_hagrid How often do you come across a three headed dog , even if you're in the trade ?
rubeus_hagrid But I told him .
rubeus_hagrid I said , " The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him .
rubeus_hagrid Take Fluffy , for example , just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep .
rubeus_hagrid " I shouldn't have told you that .
rubeus_hagrid Where you going? !
rubeus_hagrid Wait !
harry_potter We have to see Professor dumbledore , immediately !
professor_minerva_mcgonagall I'm afraid Professor dumbledore is not here .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London .
harry_potter He's gone? !
harry_potter Now ?
harry_potter But this is important !
harry_potter It's about ...
harry_potter the Philosopher's Stone .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall How do you know
harry_potter Someone's going to try and steal it .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall I don't know how you three found out about the stone , but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected .
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Now would you go back to your dormitories ?
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Quietly .
harry_potter That was no stranger hagrid met in the village .
harry_potter It was snape , which means he knows how to get past Fluffy .
hermione_granger And with dumbledore gone
professor_severus_snape Good afternoon .
professor_severus_snape Now , what would three young gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this ?
hermione_granger Uh ...we were just ...
professor_severus_snape You want to be careful .
professor_severus_snape People will think you're
hermione_granger Now what do we do ?
harry_potter We go down the trapdoor .
harry_potter Tonight .
harry_potter Trevor .
ron_weasley Trevor shh !
ron_weasley Go , you shouldn't be here !
neville_longbottom Neither should you .
neville_longbottom You're sneaking out again , arent you ?
harry_potter Now , neville , listen .
harry_potter We were
neville_longbottom No !
neville_longbottom I won't let you !
hermione_granger neville , I'm really , really sorry about this ...
hermione_granger Petrificus Totalus .
ron_weasley You're a little scary sometimes ...
ron_weasley you know that ?
ron_weasley Brilliant , but scary .
harry_potter Let's go .
harry_potter Sorry .
hermione_granger Sorry .
ron_weasley It's for your own good , you know .
hermione_granger Ow !
hermione_granger You stood on my foot !
ron_weasley Sorry .
hermione_granger Alohomora .
ron_weasley Wait a minute ...
ron_weasley he's ... .
ron_weasley Sleeping .
harry_potter snape's already been here .
harry_potter He's put a spell on the harp .
ron_weasley Uh .
ron_weasley It's got horrible breath !
harry_potter We have to move its paw .
ron_weasley What? !
harry_potter Come on !
harry_potter If something bad happens , get yourselves out ...
harry_potter Does it seem a bit ...quiet ?
hermione_granger The harp .
hermione_granger It stopped playing .
ron_weasley Ew !
ron_weasley Yuck !
ron_weasley Ugh .
harry_potter Jump !
harry_potter Go !
ron_weasley Ahh !
ron_weasley Whoa .
ron_weasley Lucky this plant-thing is here , really .
harry_potter Whoa !
hermione_granger Stop moving , both of you .
hermione_granger This is Devil's Snare .
hermione_granger You have to relax .
hermione_granger If you don't , it will only kill you faster .
ron_weasley Kill us faster? !
ron_weasley Oh , now I can relax !
ron_weasley@harry_potter hermione! !
ron_weasley Now what are we gonna do? !
hermione_granger voice Just relax !
harry_potter hermione !
harry_potter Where are you? !
hermione_granger Do what I say .
hermione_granger Trust me .
ron_weasley Ahh !
ron_weasley harry !
ron_weasley harry !
hermione_granger Are you okay ?
harry_potter Yeah ,
harry_potter yeah , I'm fine .
ron_weasley Help !
hermione_granger He's not relaxing , is he ?
harry_potter Apparently not .
ron_weasley Help !
ron_weasley Help me !
hermione_granger We've got to do something !
harry_potter What ?
hermione_granger Uh !
hermione_granger I remember reading something in Herbology .
ron_weasley Ahhh !
harry_potter ron , are you okay ?
ron_weasley Yeah .
harry_potter Okay .
ron_weasley Whew .
ron_weasley Lucky we didn't panic !
harry_potter Lucky hermione pays attention in Herbology .
hermione_granger What is that ?
harry_potter I don't know .
harry_potter Sounds like wings .
hermione_granger Curious .
hermione_granger I've never seen birds like these .
harry_potter They're not birds , they're keys .
harry_potter And I'll bet one of them fits that door .
hermione_granger What's this all about ?
harry_potter I don't know .
harry_potter Strange .
ron_weasley Well , it was worth a try .
hermione_granger Ugh !
hermione_granger What're we going to do ?
hermione_granger There must be 1000 keys up there !
ron_weasley We're looking for a big old fashioned one .
ron_weasley Probably rusty like the handle .
harry_potter There !
harry_potter I see it !
hermione_granger What's wrong , harry ?
harry_potter It's too simple .
ron_weasley Oh , go on , harry !
ron_weasley If snape can catch it on that old broomstick , you can !
ron_weasley You're the youngest seeker in a century !
ron_weasley This complicates things a bit !
harry_potter Catch the key !
ron_weasley Hurry up !
hermione_granger I don't like this .
hermione_granger I don't like this at all .
harry_potter Where are we ?
harry_potter A graveyard .
ron_weasley This is no graveyard .
harry_potter There's the door .
hermione_granger Now what do we do ?
ron_weasley It's obvious , isn't it ?
ron_weasley We've got to play our way across the room .
ron_weasley all right .
ron_weasley harry , you take the Bishop's square .
ron_weasley hermione , you'll be the Queen's side castle .
ron_weasley As for me , I'll be a knight .
hermione_granger What happens now ?
hermione_granger ron , you don't suppose this is going to be like ...
hermione_granger real wizard's chess , do you ?
ron_weasley You there ! D-5 !
ron_weasley Yes , hermione , I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess !
ron_weasley Castle to E-4 !
ron_weasley Smash !
ron_weasley ron Pawn to C-3 !
ron_weasley Smash !
ron_weasley Boom !
ron_weasley The Queen turns , and smashes a piece !
ron_weasley The Queen turns again .
harry_potter Wait a minute .
ron_weasley You understand right , harry .
ron_weasley Once I make my move , the Queen will take me ...then you'll be free to check the King .
harry_potter No , ron !
harry_potter No !
hermione_granger What is it ?
harry_potter He's going to sacrifice himself !
hermione_granger No , ron , you can't !
hermione_granger There must be another way !
ron_weasley Knight ...
ron_weasley to H-3 .
ron_weasley Check .
ron_weasley Ahhhh !
harry_potter RON !
harry_potter Take care of ron .
harry_potter Then , go to the owlery .
harry_potter Send a message to dumbledore .
harry_potter ron's right ...I have to go on .
hermione_granger You'll be okay , harry .
hermione_granger You're a great wizard , you really are .
harry_potter Not as good as you .
hermione_granger Me ?
hermione_granger Books and cleverness ?
hermione_granger There are more important things .
hermione_granger Friendship , and bravery .
hermione_granger And harry , just be careful .
harry_potter No .
harry_potter It can't be ...snape .
harry_potter He was the one
professor_quirinus_quirrell Yes .
professor_quirinus_quirrell He does seem the type , doesn't he ?
professor_quirinus_quirrell Next to me , who would suspect , " p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor quirrell? "
harry_potter B-but , that day , during the Quidditch Match , snape tried to kill me .
professor_quirinus_quirrell No , dear boy .
professor_quirinus_quirrell I tried to kill you !
professor_quirinus_quirrell And trust me , if snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact , I would have succeeded .
professor_quirinus_quirrell Even with snape muttering his little counter-curse .
harry_potter snape was trying to ...save me ?
professor_quirinus_quirrell I knew you were a danger right from the off .
professor_quirinus_quirrell Especially after Halloween .
harry_potter Th-then you let the troll in .
professor_quirinus_quirrell Very good Potter , yes .
professor_quirinus_quirrell snape , unfortunately , wasn't fooled .
professor_quirinus_quirrell While everyone else was running to the dungeon , he went to the 3rd floor to head me off .
professor_quirinus_quirrell He , of course , never trusted me again .
professor_quirinus_quirrell He rarely left me alone .
professor_quirinus_quirrell But he doesn't understand .
professor_quirinus_quirrell I'm never alone .
professor_quirinus_quirrell Never .
professor_quirinus_quirrell Now ...what does this mirror do ?
professor_quirinus_quirrell I see what I desire .
professor_quirinus_quirrell I see myself holding the stone .
professor_quirinus_quirrell But how do I get it ?
professor_quirinus_quirrell Come here , Potter , now !
professor_quirinus_quirrell Tell me .
professor_quirinus_quirrell What do you see ?
professor_quirinus_quirrell What is it? !
professor_quirinus_quirrell What do you see? !
harry_potter I-I'm shaking hands with dumbledore .
harry_potter I've won the house cup .
he_who_must_not_be_named He lies .
professor_quirinus_quirrell Tell the truth !
professor_quirinus_quirrell What do you see? !
he_who_must_not_be_named voice Let me speak to him .
professor_quirinus_quirrell Master , you are not strong enough .
he_who_must_not_be_named I have strength enough for this .
he_who_must_not_be_named harry Potter .
he_who_must_not_be_named We meet again .
harry_potter voldemort .
he_who_must_not_be_named Yes .
he_who_must_not_be_named You see what I have become ?
he_who_must_not_be_named See what I must do to survive ?
he_who_must_not_be_named Live off another .
he_who_must_not_be_named A mere parasite .
he_who_must_not_be_named Unicorn blood can sustain me , but it cannot give me a body of my own .
he_who_must_not_be_named But there is something that can .
he_who_must_not_be_named Something , that conveniently enough , lies in your pocket !
he_who_must_not_be_named Stop him !
he_who_must_not_be_named Don't be a fool !
he_who_must_not_be_named Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live? !
harry_potter Never !
he_who_must_not_be_named Haha .
he_who_must_not_be_named Bravery .
he_who_must_not_be_named Your parents had it too .
he_who_must_not_be_named Tell me , harry , would you like to see your mother and father again ?
he_who_must_not_be_named Together , we can bring them back .
harry_potter You liar !
he_who_must_not_be_named Kill him !
professor_quirinus_quirrell Ahh !
professor_quirinus_quirrell Ahh !
he_who_must_not_be_named Fool !
he_who_must_not_be_named Get the stone !
professor_quirinus_quirrell Ahhhhhhhhhh !
he_who_must_not_be_named Arrrhhhhhh !
harry_potter Ahhhhhhhhh !
albus_dumbledore Good afternoon , harry .
albus_dumbledore Ah .
albus_dumbledore Tokens from your admirers ?
harry_potter Admirers ?
albus_dumbledore What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor quirrell is a complete secret , so , naturally , the whole school knows .
albus_dumbledore Ah , I see your friend ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate frogs .
harry_potter ron was here ?
harry_potter Is he all right ?
harry_potter What about hermione ?
albus_dumbledore Fine .
albus_dumbledore They're both just fine .
harry_potter But , what happened to the Stone ?
albus_dumbledore Relax , dear boy .
albus_dumbledore The stone has been destroyed .
albus_dumbledore My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around .
harry_potter But Flamel , he'll die , won't he ?
albus_dumbledore He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order .
albus_dumbledore But yes , he will die .
harry_potter How is it
harry_potter I got the Stone , sir ?
harry_potter One minute I was staring in the mirror , and the next ...
albus_dumbledore Ah .
albus_dumbledore You see , only a person who wanted to find the Stone , find it , but not use it , would be able to get it .
albus_dumbledore That is one of my more brilliant ideas .
albus_dumbledore And between you and me thats saying something .
harry_potter Does that mean , with the Stone gone , I mean , that voldemort can never come back ?
albus_dumbledore Ah , I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return .
albus_dumbledore harry , do you know why Professor quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him ?
albus_dumbledore No , no , this kind of mark cannot be seen .
albus_dumbledore It lives in your very skin .
harry_potter What is it ?
albus_dumbledore Love , harry , love .
albus_dumbledore Mm .
albus_dumbledore Alas .
albus_dumbledore Earwax .
harry_potter all right there , ron ?
ron_weasley all right ?
ron_weasley You ?
harry_potter all right .
harry_potter hermione ?
hermione_granger Never better .
albus_dumbledore Another year gone .
albus_dumbledore And now , as I understand it , the house cup needs awarding , and the points stand thus .
albus_dumbledore In fourth place , Gryffindor with 312 points .
albus_dumbledore And in first place , with 472 points , Slytherin House .
students#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode01 Whoo !
students#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode01 Yeah !
draco_malfoy Nice one , Mate !
albus_dumbledore Yes , yes , well done Slytherin , well done Slytherin .
albus_dumbledore However , recent events must be taken into account .
albus_dumbledore And I have a few last minute points to award .
harry_potter Good job .
albus_dumbledore Second , to Mr .
albus_dumbledore ronald Weasley , for the best played game of chess
hermione_granger We're tied with Slytherin !
albus_dumbledore And finally , it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies , but a great deal more to stand up to your friends .
albus_dumbledore I award 10 points to neville Longbottom .
albus_dumbledore Assuming that my calculations are correct , I believe that a change of direction is in order .
albus_dumbledore Gryffindor wins the House Cup !
rubeus_hagrid Yes !
seamus_finnigan neville !
lee_jordan Yeah !
lee_jordan We won! !

rubeus_hagrid Oh .
rubeus_hagrid Go on ...on with you .
rubeus_hagrid Oh , listen , harry , if that dolt of a cousin of yours , dudley , gives you any grief , you could always , um , threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his .
harry_potter But hagrid , we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts .
harry_potter You know that .

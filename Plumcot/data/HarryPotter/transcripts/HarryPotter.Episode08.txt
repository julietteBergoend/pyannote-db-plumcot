 luna_lovegood It's beautiful here.
bill_weasley It was our aunt's. We used to come here as kids. The order uses it now as a safe house. What's left of us at least.
luna_lovegood Muggles think these keep away evil, but they're wrong.
harry_potter I need to talk to the goblin. 
not_available How are you?
not_available You buried the elf?
not_available Yes.
not_available And brought me here.
not_available You are...
not_available Pretty unusual, is it?
griphook How did you come by the sword?
harry_potter  It's complicated.
harry_potter  Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think
harry_potter e that it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
griphook It's complicated.
not_available The sword presented itself to us,
not_available in moment of need.
not_available We didn't steal it.
not_available There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault
not_available identical to this one.
not_available But it is a fake.
not_available It was placed there this past summer.
not_available And she never suspected it was a fake.
not_available The replica is very convincing.
not_available Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.
not_available Who is the acquaintance?
not_available A Hogwarts Professor.
not_available As I understand that he's now Headmaster.
not_available Snape.
not_available He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault.
not_available Why?
not_available There are more than a fewcurious things
not_available in the vaults at Gringotts.
not_available And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
not_available Perhaps.
not_available I need to get into Gringotts.
not_available Into one of the vaults.
not_available It is impossible.
not_available Alone, yes.
not_available But with you, no.
not_available Why should I help you?
not_available I have gold.
not_available Lots of...
not_available I've no interest in gold.
not_available Then what?
not_available That.
not_available That is my price.
not_available Are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?
not_available Well, she was terrified when she thought we had been in there.
not_available She kept asking you,
not_available what else was taken?
not_available I bet you anything, there's Horcrux in there.
not_available Another piece of his soul.
not_available Let's find it, kill it, and we are
not_available one step closer to killing him.
not_available And what happens when we find it,
not_available How're we supposed to destroy it, now you're giving the sword to Griphook?
not_available I'm still working on that part.
not_available He's weak.
not_available Who?
not_available Mr. Ollivander
not_available I need to ask you a few questions.
not_available Anything, m'boy.
not_available Anything!
not_available Would you mind identifying this wand?
not_available We need to know if it's safe to use.
not_available Uhh... Walnut
not_available Dragon Heartstring
not_available Unyie...
not_available Unyielding.
not_available This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.
not_available Treat it carefully.
not_available And this?
not_available Hawthorn.
not_available An unicorn hair.
not_available Reasonably pliant.
not_available This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
not_available Was?
not_available Is it not still?
not_available Well, perhaps not.
not_available If you won it from him.
not_available I sense its allegiance has changed.
not_available You talk about wands,
not_available as if they have feelings...
not_available ...can think!
not_available The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
not_available That much has always been clear to
not_available those of us who've studied wandlore.
not_available And, what do you know about the Deathly Hallows?
not_available It is rumored there are three.
not_available The Elder Wand, the Cloak of Invisibility,
not_available to hide you from your enemies...
not_available and the Resurrection Stone, to bring
not_available back loved ones from the dead.
not_available Together, they make one the Master of Death.
not_available But, few truly believe that such objects exist.
not_available Do you?
not_available Do you believe they exist, sir?
not_available Well...
not_available I see no reasons to put
not_available stock into an old wives' tale.
not_available You're lying!
not_available You know one exists.
not_available You told him about it.
not_available You told him about the Elder Wand...
not_available and where he could go looking for it.
not_available He tortured me.
not_available Besides...
not_available ...I only conveyed rumors.
not_available There's...
not_available There's no telling whether he will find it.
not_available He has found it, sir.
not_available We'll let you rest.
not_available He's after you, Mr. Potter.
not_available If it's true what you say,
not_available that he has the Elder Wand,
not_available I'm afraid,
not_available ...you really don't stand a chance.
not_available Well, I am supposed to kill him, before he finds me, then.
not_available You're sure that's hers?
not_available Positive.
not_available Well?
not_available How do I look?
not_available Hideous.
not_available You can give that to Hermione to hold.
not_available Alright, Griphook?
not_available We're relying on you, Griphook.
not_available If you get us past the guards into the vault...
not_available The sword's yours.
not_available Madam Lestrange.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Good morning?
not_available Good morning?
not_available You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not_available not a school girl!
not_available Hey!
not_available Easy!
not_available If she gives us away, we must swear
not_available to use that sword to slit our own throats.
not_available Understand?
not_available No, he's right.
not_available I speak stupid.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available I wish to enter my vault.
not_available Identification?
not_available I hardly think that would be necessary.
not_available Madam Lestrange.
not_available I don't like to be kept waiting.
not_available I know...
not_available They know she's an impostor.
not_available They'd be warned.
not_available Harry...
not_available What do we do, Harry?
not_available Madam Lestrange,
not_available would you mind presenting your wand?
not_available And why should I do that?
not_available It's the bank's policy!
not_available I'm sure you understand, given current climate.
not_available No! I most certainly do not understand!
not_available I'm afraid, I must insist.
not_available Imperio!
not_available Very well, Madam Lestrange.
not_available If you would follow me?
not_available What is that, Griphook?
not_available Griphook!
not_available Aresto Momentum
not_available Well done, Hermione.
not_available Oh no, you two're like you again.
not_available The Thief's Downfall,
not_available washes away all enchantment.
not_available Can be deadly.
not_available You don't say.
not_available Just out of interest,
not_available is there any other way outta here?
not_available No.
not_available What the devil are all you doing down here?
not_available Thieves!
not_available You gave up the...
not_available Imperio
not_available You!
not_available That doesn't sound good.
not_available Bloody hell!
not_available It's an Ukrainian Ironbelly.
not_available Here.
not_available It's been trained to expect pain
not_available when it hears this noise.
not_available That's barbaric!
not_available Lumos.
not_available Blimey!
not_available Accio Horcrux!
not_available You seem you're gonna try
not_available this here, won't you?
not_available No kind of magic would work in here.
not_available It's in here, Harry?
not_available Can you feel anything?
not_available That's it!
not_available Up there!
not_available They have added the Gemino curse.
not_available Everything you touch will multiply.
not_available Give me the sword.
not_available Stop moving!
not_available Do it!
harry_potter We had a deal, Griphook!
griphook The cup for the sword!
griphook I said I'd get you in. I didn't say anything about getting you out!
harry_potter GRIPHOOK!
griphook THIEVES!
harry_potter GRIPHOOK!
griphook HELP, THIEVES!
ron_weasley That foul little git! At least we've still got Bogrod.
ron_weasley That's unfortunate! 
hermione_grander We can't just stand here. Who's got an idea?
ron_weasley Don't ask us. You're the brilliant one!
.
not_available I've got something,
not_available but it's mad!
not_available Reducto
not_available Well, come on, then!
not_available Relashio
not_available Keep moving!
not_available Now what?
not_available Reducto
not_available Hold on.
not_available That was brilliant!
not_available Absolutely brilliant!
not_available We're dropping!
not_available I say we jump!
not_available When?
not_available Now!
not_available He knows.
not_available YouKnow
not_available Who.
not_available He knows we broke into Gringotts.
not_available He knows what we took,
not_available and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.
not_available How did he know?
not_available I saw him.
not_available You let him in?
not_available Harry, you can't do that!
not_available Hermione, I can't always help it!
not_available Well, maybe I can.
not_available I don't know!
not_available Never mind!
not_available What happened?
not_available Well, he's angry...
not_available and scared too.
not_available He knows, if we find and destroy
not_available all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.
not_available I reckon he'll stop at nothing
not_available to make sure we don't find the rest.
not_available And there's more.
not_available One of them is at Hogwarts.
not_available What?
not_available You saw it?
not_available I saw the castle.
not_available And Rowena Ravenclaw.
not_available It must have something to do with her.
harry_potter We have to go there, now!
hermione_granger Well, we can't do that!
hermione_granger We've got to plan,
hermione_granger we've got to figure it out!
harry_potter Hermione, when have any of
harry_potter our plans ever actually worked?
harry_potter We plan, we get there,
harry_potter all hell breaks loose.
not_available He's right!
not_available One problem...
not_available Snape's Headmaster now,
not_available we can't just move freely from the front door!
not_available Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,
not_available to Honeydukes.
not_available Take the secret passage in the cellar.
not_available It's...
not_available There's something wrong with him.
not_available It's like, you know,
not_available in the past...
not_available I've always been able
not_available to follow his thoughts.
not_available And now everything just feels disconnected.
not_available Maybe it's the Horcruxes.
not_available Maybe he's getting weaker.
not_available Maybe he's dying!
not_available No!
not_available No, it's.. it's more like he's wounded.
not_available If anything, he feels more dangerous.
not_available Right here. Come on!
not_available Search everywhere.
not_available Go, move!
not_available Faster!
not_available In here, Potter.
not_available Come on, move!
not_available Did you look at him.
not_available For a second I thought that was...
not_available I know. Dumbledore!
not_available Harry?
not_available I can see you in this.
not_available Bloody fools, what are you thinking coming here?
not_available Have you any idea how dangerous it is?
not_available You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.
not_available It's you who I've been seeing in here.
not_available You're the one who sent Dobby.
not_available Why've you left him?
not_available He's dead.
not_available Sorry to hear it.
not_available I liked that elf.
not_available Who gave that to you?
not_available The mirror?
not_available Mundungus Fletcher, about a year ago.
not_available Dung had no right selling that to you.
not_available It belongs to...
not_available Sirius...
not_available Albus told me.
not_available He also told me you'd likely be hacked off,
not_available ...if you ever found that I had it.
not_available But, ask yourself;
not_available Where would you be if I didn't?
not_available Do you have any others much?
not_available From the Order?
not_available The Order has finished.
not_available YouKnow
not_available Who has won,
not_available ...anyone who says otherwise
not_available is killing themselves.
not_available We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.
not_available Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
not_available Did he now...
not_available Nice job?
not_available Easy?
not_available We've been hunting Horcruxes.
not_available We think the last one's inside the castle.
not_available But we'll need your help getting in.
not_available Which job my brother has given you, it's a suicide mission.
not_available Do yourself a favor, boy.
not_available Go home!
not_available Live a little longer.
harry_potter Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
aberforth_dumbledore What makes you think you can trust him? What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you? In all the time you knew him, did he ever mention my name? Did he ever mention hers?
harry_potter Why should he...
aberforth_dumbledore ...Keep secrets, you tell me?
harry_potter I trusted him.
aberforth_dumbledore That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing horcruxes on the word of a man who wouldn't even tell you where to start. You're lying!
not_available Not just on me, it doesn't matter.
not_available To yourself as well.
not_available That's what a fool does.
not_available You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter!
not_available So, I ask you again, there must be a reason.
not_available I'm not interested in what happened
not_available between you and your brother.
not_available I don't care that you've given up.
not_available I trusted the man I knew.
not_available We need to get into the castle tonight.
not_available You know what to do.
not_available Where have you sent her?
not_available You'll see.
not_available Soon enough.
not_available That's your sister, Ariana.
not_available Isn't it?
not_available She died very young, didn't she?
not_available My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter.
not_available On his journey to find power.
not_available Including Ariana.
not_available And she was devoted to him.
not_available He gave her everything.
not_available But time.
not_available Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.
not_available He did save our lives twice!
not_available Kept an eye on us on that mirror.
not_available That doesn't seem like someone who's given up!
not_available She's coming back.
not_available What's that with her?
not_available Neville!
not_available How you look...
not_available Like hell, I reckon.
not_available But this is nothing.
not_available Seamus is worse.
not_available Hey, Ab!
not_available We've got a couple more coming through.
not_available Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.
not_available That's because it never existed till now.
not_available The seven secret passages were sealed off,
not_available before the start of the year.
not_available This is the only way in or out, now.
not_available The grounds are crawled with Death Eaters and Dementors.
not_available How about Mr.Snape as Headmaster?
not_available Hardly ever seen.
not_available It's the Carrows who's watching out for.
not_available Carrows?
not_available Yeah. Brother and sister.
not_available Incharge of discipline.
not_available They like punishment, the Carrows.
not_available They did that to you?
not_available Why?
not_available Today's Dark Arts lesson was
not_available practicing the Cruciatus curse.
not_available On first years.
not_available I refused.
not_available Hogwarts has changed.
not_available Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?
not_available Hey, you lots! It's
not_available for your surprise.
not_available No more about Aberforth's cook's gonna help.
not_available We'll be surprised if it's just digested.
not_available Oh my!
not_available Harry!
not_available Get the word out to Remus and the others, that Harry is back.
not_available Okay, okay!
not_available Let's not kill him before YouKnow
not_available Who does.
not_available ...Do you read? we've a new weather report.
not_available Lightning has struck. I 
repeat Lightning has struck.
neville_longbottom Right then, so what's the plan Harry?
harry_potter Okay, there's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle, and it may help us defeat You-Know-Who.
neville_longbottom Right, what is it?
harry_potter We don't know.
dean_thomas Where is it?
harry_potter We don't know that either. I realise that's not much to go on.
seamus_finnigan That's nothing to go on.
not_available I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw.
not_available It'll be small, easily concealed.
not_available Anyone, any ideas?
luna_lovegood Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.
ron_weasley Oh bloody hell, here we go.
not_available Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?
not_available Hasn't anyone heard of it?
not_available It's quite famous.
not_available Yes. But, Luna, it's lost.
not_available For centuries.
not_available There's no person alive today who's seen it.
not_available Excuse me, can someone tell me what bloody diadem is?
not_available It's a sort of crown.
not_available You know, like a tiara.
not_available Harry!
ginny_weasley Harry!
harry_potter Hi there.
ron_weasley Six months she hadn't see me, it's like I'm a Frankie First Year. I'm only her brother...
seamus_finnigan She's got lots of them, but there's only one Harry.
ron_weasley Shut up Seamus.
not_available What is it, Ginny?
not_available Snape knows... he knows
not_available that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
professor_severus_snape You are surely wondering why I have summoned you at this hour. It has come to my attention earlier this evening, Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
professor_severus_snape Now, should anyone, student or staff, attempt to aid Mr. Potter, they will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression.
professor_severus_snape Furthermore, any person found to have knowledge of these events who fails to come forward will be treated as... equally guilty. Now then...
professor_severus_snape ... if anyone in here has any knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening...
professor_severus_snape ... I invite them to step forward... now.
harry_potter It seems, despite your exhaustive defenses strategies, you still have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster.
harry_potter I'm afraid it's quite extensive, how dare you stand where he stood. Tell them how it happened that night! Tell them how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you, and killed him! Tell them!
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Coward!
not_available Harry.
not_available Potter?
not_available I know that many of you will want to fight.
not_available Some of you might even think to fight is wise.
not_available But this is folly.
not_available Give me Harry Potter.
not_available Do this and none shall be harmed.
not_available Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.
not_available Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.
not_available You have one hour.
pansy_parkinson What you waiting for?
pansy_parkinson Someone grab him! 
not_available Students out of bed!
not_available Students in the corridor!
not_available They're supposed to be out of bed,
not_available you blithering idiot!
not_available Sorry ma'am.
not_available As it happens, Mr. Filch...
not_available Your arrival is most opportune.
not_available If you would, I wouldd like you please, to lead Miss Parkinson
not_available and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall.
not_available Exactly where is it I'll be leading 'em to, ma'am?
not_available The dungeons would do.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall What is it you need?
harry_potter Time, Professor.
harry_potte As much as you can get me.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Do what you have to do.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall I'll secure the castle.
not_available Potter...
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available It's good to see you too, Professor.
not_available Hold the fort, Neville.
not_available Harry!
not_available Hermione and I were thinking,
not_available it doesn't matter if we find the Horcrux.
not_available What do you mean?
not_available Unless we can destroy it.
not_available So, we were thinking...
not_available Well, Ron was thinking, it was Ron's idea.
not_available It was completely brilliant
not_available You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
not_available with a Basilisk fang, right?
not_available Well, me and Hermione did remind
not_available where we might find one.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, but take this.
not_available That way, you can find me when you get back.
not_available Where're you going?
not_available Ravenclaw common room,
not_available Gotta start somewhere.
not_available Harry!
not_available Harry!
not_available Let me get this straight, Professor...
not_available You're actually giving us
not_available permission to do this?
not_available That is correct, Longbottom.
not_available That's blowing up!
not_available Boom!
not_available Boom!
not_available Wicked!
not_available But how on earth are we gonna do that?
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan? As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.
seamus_finnigan I can bring it down!
professor_minerva_mcgonagall That's the spirit, now away you go.
griphook You do realize we can't keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall That doesn't mean we can't delay him. And his name is Voldemort, Filius. You might as well use it, he's going to try and kill you either way.
not_available Piertotum Locomotor.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall  Hogwarts is threatened.
not_available Man the boundaries! Protect us.
not_available Do your duty...
not_available ...to our school.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall  I always wanted to use that spell!
not_available Protego Maxima
not_available Fianto Duri
not_available Repello Inimigotum
not_available Protego Maxima
not_available Fianto Duri
not_available Repello...
not_available Protego Maxima
not_available Fianto Duri
not_available Repello Inimigotum
not_available Protego Maxima
not_available Harry, wait!
not_available I need to talk to you!
luna_lovegood Harry, wait, I need to talk to you.
harry_potter I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment, Luna.
luna_lovegood You won't find it where you're going, you're wasting your time.
harry_potter We'll talk later, ok?
luna_lovegood Harry!
harry_potter Later!
luna_lovegood Harry Potter! You listen to me right now! Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem? There's not a person alive whose seen it. It's obvious isn't it? You have to talk to someone who's dead.
not_available It's very impressive, isn't it?
not_available If you want to find her,
not_available you'll find her down there.
not_available Aren't you coming?
not_available No.
not_available I think it's best if you two talk alone.
not_available She's very shy.
not_available You're the Grey Lady.
not_available The ghost of Ravenclaw tower.
not_available I do not answer to that name!
not_available No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
not_available It's Helena, isn't it?
not_available Helena Ravenclaw,
not_available Rowena's daughter.
not_available Are you a friend of Luna's?
not_available Yes.
not_available And she thought you might be able to help me.
not_available You seek my mother's diadem?
not_available Yes.
not_available That's right.
not_available Luna is kind.
not_available Unlike so many of the others.
not_available But she was wrong,
not_available I cannot help you!
not_available Wait, please!
not_available I want to destroy it!
not_available They never learn.
not_available Such a pity.
not_available My Lord...
not_available Shouldn't we wait?
not_available Begin!
not_available I thought you want to do it.
not_available Isn't it, Helena?
not_available You want it destroyed?
not_available Another promised
not_available to destroy it many years ago.
not_available A strange boy with a strange name?
not_available Tom Riddle.
not_available But he lied.
not_available He lied to many people.
not_available I know what he's done!
not_available I know who he is!
not_available He defiled it, with dark magic!
not_available I can destroy it.
not_available Once and for all.
not_available But only if you tell me
not_available where he hid it?
not_available You do know where he hid it?
not_available Don't you, Helena?
not_available You just have to tell me.
not_available Please!
not_available Strange!
not_available You remind me of him a bit.
not_available It's here, in the castle.
not_available In the place where everything is hidden.
not_available If you have to ask...
not_available ...you will never know.
not_available If you know...
not_available ...you need only ask.
not_available Thank you!
not_available Tell Professor McGonagall.
not_available Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.
not_available Yes, sir!
not_available Hey Dean, with second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall we
not_available might need one or two more wands this side.
remus_lupin  It is the quality of one's convictions that determines one's success..
remus_lupin  ...not the number of followers.
kingsley_shacklebolt Who said that?
remus_lupin  Me.
george_weasley You okay, Freddie?
fred_weasley Yeah.
george_weasley Me too.
not_available Harry talks this in sleep.
not_available You know it?
not_available No, of course, not!
not_available Yeah?
not_available YouKnow
not_available Who's army?
not_available You do it.
not_available I can't.
not_available Yes, you can!
not_available Neville!
not_available That went well.
not_available Get inside!
not_available Stupefy
harry_potter Ginny! Neville! Are you all right?
neville_longbottom Never better! I feel like I could spit fire! You haven't seen Luna have you?
harry_potter Luna?
neville_longbottom I'm mad for her. I think it's about time I told her, since we'll probably both be dead by dawn!
ginny_weasley I know.
not_available Bloody hell!
not_available We'll never find him on this.
not_available Here he is!
not_available He's just...
not_available Brilliant!
not_available He just vanished.
not_available I'm sure I saw it.
not_available Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement.
not_available It doesn't show up on the map, does it?
not_available You said that last year.
not_available That's right, I did.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Brilliant!
not_available Come on!
draco_malfoy Well, well! What brings you here, Potter?
harry_potter I would ask you the same.
draco_malfoy You have something of mine, I'd like it back.
harry_potter What's wrong with the one you have?
draco_malfoy It's my mother's, it's powerful but it's... not the same. It doesn't quite... understand me. You know what I mean?
harry_potter Why didn't you tell her? Bellatrix.
harry_potter You knew it was me. You didn't say anything.
gregory_goyle Go on, Draco! Don't be a prat! Do him!
draco_malfoy Easy!
not_available Expelliarmus
gregory_goyle Avada Kedavra
not_available Stupefy
ron_weasley This is my girlfriend,
ron_weasley you bloody gits!
not_available Got it!
not_available They've set the bloody place on fire!
not_available Come on!
not_available This way!
not_available We can't leave them!
not_available He's joking, right?
not_available If we die for them,
not_available Harry, I'm gonna kill you!
not_available Harry!
not_available My Lord?
not_available Avada Kedavra!
not_available Come Nagini, I need to keep you safe.
not_available It's the snake.
not_available She's the last one.
not_available It's the last Horcrux.
not_available Look inside him, Harry.
not_available Find out where he is,
not_available if you find him, we can find the snake.
not_available And we can end this!
lucius_malfoy My Lord... might it... be less, uh - might it not be more prudent to call off this attack and simply seek the boy yourself?
lord_voldemort I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will come to ME! Do you understand!
lord_voldemort Look at me! How can you live with yourself, Lucius?
lucius_malfoy I don't know.
lord_voldemort Go and find Severus. Bring him to me.
not_available I know where he is.
not_available Come on!
not_available No!
not_available You have performed extra
not_available ordinary magic
not_available with this wand, My Lord,
not_available in the last few hours alone.
not_available No!
not_available No! I am extra
not_available ordinary.
not_available But the wand resists me .
not_available There is no wand more powerful.
not_available Ollivander himself has said it.
not_available Tonight, when the boy comes.
not_available It will not fail you, I am sure ...
not_available It answers to you,
not_available and you only.
not_available Does it?
not_available My Lord?
 lord_voldemort The wand, does it truly answer to me? You're a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know. Where does its true loyalty lie?
professor_severus_snape With you... of course, my Lord.
lord_voldemort The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner.
lord_voldemort You killed Dumbledore, Severus. While you live, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine. You've been a good and faithful servant Severus - but only I can live... forever.
professor_severus_snape My Lord...
lord_voldemort Nagini, kill! 
not_available Take it...
not_available Take it up, please!
not_available Give me something!
not_available Quickly, a flask. Anything!
not_available Take them to the Pensieve.
not_available Look at me...
not_available You really have your mother's eyes.
lord_voldemort You have fought valiantly, but in vain.
lord_voldemort I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. I therefore command my forces to retreat.
lord_voldemort In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you. On this night, you have allowed your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself.
lord_voldemort There is no greater dishonor. Join me in the Forbidden Forest and confront your fate. If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man, woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.
 hermione_grander Where is everybody?
professor_horace_slughorn  Harry...
professor_pomona_sprout Oh come on, what's the matter with you?
padma_patil Oh, she's passed.
professor_sybil_trelawney There, she's gone.
not_available Freak! Come here! I'm gonna tell mommy!
not_available You're freak!
not_available You're freak, Lily!
not_available Come here!
young_severus_snape She's just jealous. That she's ordinary, and you're special.
young_lily_potter That's mean, Severus.
not_available Gryffindor!
not_available Hi, I'm James.
not_available Hi, I'm Lily.
not_available Just like your father.
not_available Don't say a word against my father!
not_available Masters shall be reunited once more!
not_available Severus.
professor_severus_snape No! Don't kill me!
albus_dumbledore The prophecy did not refer to a women. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July.
professor_severus_snape Yes but, he thinks its her son! He intends to hunt them down now, to kill them. Hide her, hide them all. I beg you.
albus_dumbledore What will you give me in return, Severus?
professor_severus_snape Anything.
not_available Harry...
not_available Harry, you were so loved.
not_available So loved!
not_available Harry, mama loves you.
not_available Dadda loves you.
not_available Harry, be safe.
not_available Be strong.
not_available Avada Kedavra!
not_available You said you would keep her safe.
not_available Lily and James...
not_available put their faith in the wrong person, Severus.
not_available Rather like you.
albus_dumbledore The boy survives.
professor_severus_snape He doesn't need protection, the Dark Lord is gone!
albus_dumbledore The Dark Lord will return! And when he does, the boy will be in terrible danger! He has her eyes.
albus_dumbledore If you truly loved her...
professor_severus_snape No one... can know.
albus_dumbledore That I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus?
not_available Your word?
not_available Can you risk your life every day
not_available to protect the boy?
not_available ... He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals that of his father's and he seems to relish in his fame...
not_available Don't tell a word against my father!
not_available James Potter, lazy, arrogant.
not_available My father was a great man!
not_available Your father was a swine!
not_available Drink it, it will contain the curse to
not_available your hand, for the time being.
not_available It will spread, Albus.
not_available How long?
not_available Maybe a year.
not_available Don't ignore me, Severus.
 albus_dumbledore We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered the Malfoy boy to murder me. But should he fail, I should presume the Dark Lord will turn to you. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely.
albus_dumbledore There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
professor_severus_snape Must be told what?
albus_dumbledore On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find. Harry himself. There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind. A part of Voldemort lives inside him.
professor_severus_snape So when the time comes... the boy must die?
albus_dumbledore Yes. Yes... he must die.
professor_severus_snape You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter!
albus_dumbledore Don't tell me now that you've grown to care for the boy.
albus_dumbledore Lily.
albus_dumbledore After all this time!
professor_severus_snape Always.
not_available So, when the time comes...
not_available ...the boy must die?
not_available Yes.
not_available He must die.
not_available And Voldemort himself must do it.
not_available That is essential.
 hermione_grander Where have you been?
ron_weasley We thought you went to the Forest.
harry_potter I'm going there now.
ron_weasley Are you mad? No. You can't give yourself up to him.
hermione_grander What is it, Harry? What is it you know?
harry_potter There's a reason I can hear them... the Horcruxes. I think I've known for awhile.
harry_potter And I think you have too.
hermione_grander I'll go with you!
harry_potter No. Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him. 
 harry_potter I'm ready to die.
harry_potter The Resurrection Stone...
lily_potter You've been so brave, sweetheart.
harry_potter Why are you here? All of you?
lily_potter We never left.
harry_potter Does it-does it hurt? Dying?
sirius_black Quicker than falling asleep.
james_potter You're nearly there, son.
harry_potter I'm sorry. I never wanted any of you to die for me.
harry_potter And Remus, your son...
remus_lupin Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. One day, he'll understand.
harry_potter You'll stay with me?
james_potter Until the end.
harry_potter And he won't be able to see you?
sirius_black No.
sirius_black We're here, you see.
harry_potter Stay close to me.
lily_potter Always. 
not_available No sign of him, My Lord.
not_available I thought he'd come.
not_available Harry, no!
not_available What're yeh doin' 'ere?
not_available Quiet!
lord_voldemort Harry Potter...
lord_voldemort ...The Boy Who Lived...
lord_voldemort ...come to die.
lord_voldemort Avada Kedavra
not_available You can't help...
not_available Harry, you're a wonderful boy...
not_available You brave, brave man!
not_available Let us walk.
not_available Professor, what is that?
not_available Something beyond either of our help.
not_available A part of Voldemort sent here to die.
not_available And exactly where are we?
not_available I was gonna ask you that.
not_available Where would you say where we are?
not_available Well, it looks like King's Cross station.
not_available Only cleaner...
not_available ...and without all the trains.
not_available King's Cross, is that right?
not_available This is as they say, 'your' party.
not_available I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort...
not_available ...have been connected by something other than fate.
not_available Since that night at Godric's Hollow all those years ago.
not_available So it's true then, sir.
not_available A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?
not_available Did.
not_available It's been just destroyed many moments
not_available ago by none other than Voldemort himself.
not_available You, were the Horcrux he
not_available never meant to make, Harry.
harry_potter I have to go back, haven't I?
albus_dumbledore Oh, that's up to you.
harry_potter I have a choice?
albus_dumbledore Oh, yes. We're in King's Cross, you say? I think, if you so desired, you'd be able to board a train.
harry_potter And where would it take me?
albus_dumbledore On.
harry_potter Voldemort has the Elder Wand ?
albus_dumbledore True.
harry_potter And the snake's still alive ?
albus_dumbledore Yes.
harry_potter And I have nothing to kill it with ?
not_available Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry.
not_available To those who ask for it.
not_available I've always pride of myself
not_available on my ability to turn a phrase.
albus_dumbledore Words are, in my not so humble opinion...
not_available ..almost inexhaustible source of magic.
not_available Capable of inflicting
not_available injury and remedies.
not_available But I would in this case...
not_available amend my original statement to this:
not_available Help, will always be given at Hogwarts,
not_available To those who deserve it.
albus_dumbledore Do not pity the dead, Harry...
albus_dumbledore Pity the living.
albus_dumbledore And above all...
albus_dumbledore ...all those who live without love.
not_available Professor, my mother's Patronus...
not_available was a doe, wasn't it?
not_available As the same as Professor Snape's.
not_available It's curious, don't you think?
not_available Actually, if I think about it...
not_available ...it doesn't seem curious at all!
not_available I'll be going now, Harry.
not_available Professor?
harry_potter Is this all real?
harry_potter Or is it just happening inside my head?
albus_dumbledore Of course it's happening
albus_dumbledore inside your head, Harry.
albus_dumbledore Why should that mean, that it's not real?
not_available Professor?
not_available What should I do?
not_available Professor!
not_available My Lord, My Lord...
not_available Are you hurt?
not_available I don't need your help.
not_available The boy...
bellatrix_lestrange The boy... is he dead?
narcissa_malfoy Is he alive? Draco, is he alive?
narcissa_malfoy Dead.
ginny_weasley Dad? Who's Hagrid carrying? Dad? Who is it?
lord_voldemort Harry Potter is dead!
ginny_weasley No!
not_available No!
not_available Silence!
not_available Stupid girl!
not_available Harry Potter...
not_available is dead!
not_available From this day forth...
not_available ...you'll put your faith in me.
not_available Harry Potter is dead!
not_available And now it's the time to declare yourself.
not_available Come forward and join us...
not_available or die!
not_available Draco!
not_available Draco.
not_available Draco.
not_available Come.
not_available Well done, Draco.
not_available Well done!
not_available Well, I must say I'd hope for better.
not_available And who might you be, young man?
not_available Neville Longbottom.
not_available Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
not_available find a place for you in our rank.
not_available I'd like to say something.
not_available Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
not_available fascinated to hear what you have to say.
neville_longbottom It doesn't matter that Harry's gone.
seamus_finnigan Stand down Neville!
neville_longbottom People die every day! Friends, family... Yeah. We still lost Harry tonight. But he's still with us--in here.
neville_longbottom So's Fred, Remus, Tonks... all of them. They didn't die in vain.
neville_longbottom But YOU will. Because you're wrong!
neville_longbottom Harry's heart did beat for us! For ALL of us! It's not over!
harry_potter Confringo!
bellatrix_lestrange No! No, come back! Lucius! Come back! Come back and fight!
harry_potter I'll lure him into the castle. We have to kill the snake.
not_available Hey, Neville!
molly_weasley Not my daughter, you bitch!
not_available Hey, you were right...
harry_potter You were right. When you told Professor Snape that wand was failing you. It will always fail you!
lord_voldemort I killed Snape!
harry_potter But what if that wand never belonged to Snape? What if its allegiance was always to someone else? C'mon, Tom... let's finish this the way we started it. Together!
not_available Die!
not_available Harry!
 hermione_grander Why didn't it work for him, the Elder Wand?
harry_potter It answered to somebody else. When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his, but the thing is, the wand never belonged to Snape. It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night in the Astronomy Tower. From that moment on, the wand answered him... until the other night when I disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.
ron_weasley So that means...
harry_potter It's mine.
ron_weasley What should we do with it?
hermione_grander We?
ron_weasley I'm just saying - that's the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in the world. With that, we'd be invincible! 
not_available Together.
not_available Bag?
not_available Yeah
not_available Jumper?
not_available I'm gonna miss you.
not_available Here they come.last lines; 19 years later Harry and Ginny now married take their children to Platform Nine and ThreeQuarters to board Hogwarts Express
albus_severus_potter_19_years_later Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?
harry_potter Albus Severus Potter... you were named for two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin, and he was probably the bravest man I've ever known.
not_available But just say that I am.
not_available Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful young wizard. But listen, if it really means that much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.
not_available Really?
not_available Really.
not_available Ready?
not_available Ready.

radio#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode06 Millenium breaking disaster... All river traffic has been halted and police divers search for survivors. Surrounding area remains closed. The man, known to...
waitress Harry Potter. Who's Harry Potter?
harry_potter Oh, no one. Bit of a tosser, really.
waitress Funny that paper of yours. Couple of nights ago, I could have sworn I saw a picture move.
harry_potter Really?
waitress Thought I was going around the twist.
harry_potter Okay, I was wondering—
waitress Eleven. That's when I get off. You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter.
albus_dumbledore You've been reckless this summer, Harry.
harry_potter I like riding around the trains. It takes my mind off things.
albus_dumbledore Rather unpleasant to be old, isn't it? The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself. But now is not the time to tell it. Take my arm. Do as I say.
harry_potter I hardly just Apparated, didn't I?
albus_dumbledore Indeed. Quite successfully too, I might add. Most people vomit the first time.
harry_potter Can't imagine why.
albus_dumbledore Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton. Harry, I assume right about now you must be wondering... why I brought you here? Am I right?
harry_potter Actually sir, after all these years, I just, sort of, go with it.
albus_dumbledore Wands on, Harry. Horace! Horace.
professor_horace_slughorn Merlin's beard! You don't need to disfigure me, Albus.
albus_dumbledore Well I must say you made a very convincing armchair, Horace.
professor_horace_slughorn It's all in the upholstery. I come by this stuffing naturally. What gave me away?
albus_dumbledore Dragon's blood.
professor_horace_slughorn Oh.
harry_potter Oh yes, introductions. Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine-- Horace Slughorn. Horace... Well you know who this is.
professor_horace_slughorn Harry Potter.
albus_dumbledore So for love of theatrics, Horace... You're, by any chance, waiting for someone else, were you?
professor_horace_slughorn Someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean. Alright. The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year. Do you know what's that like? You can only say no to these people so many times. So I never stay anywhere more than a week. The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands.
albus_dumbledore Well, I think we should put it back in order for them, don't you?
professor_horace_slughorn Yes. Fine.
albus_dumbledore That was fun. Do you mind if I use the loo?
professor_horace_slughorn No, of course. Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus. The answer is still no. Absolutely, and unequivanetly, no. You're very like your father. Except the eyes, of course. You have your—
harry_potter My mother's eyes, yeah.
professor_horace_slughorn Lily, lovely Lily. She's exceedingly bright, your mother. Even more impressive even when one could say that she was Muggle-born.
harry_potter One of my best friends is Muggle-born. She's the best in our year.
professor_horace_slughorn Oh please don't think I'm prejudiced. No, no, no. Your mother was one of my absolute favorites. Look, there she is. Right at the front. All mine. Each and every one. Ex-students, I mean. You recognise Barnabas Cuffe? Editor of the Daily Prophet. Always takes my owl should I wish to register an opinion on the news of the day. Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies. Free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time. Ah, yes! Regulus Black. No doubt, there is his older brother Sirius, died a few weeks ago. I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius. It's a shame. A talented boy. I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but... but I'd like to set.
albus_dumbledore Horace! Do you mind if I take this? I do love knitting patterns.
professor_horace_slughorn Yes, of course, but you're not leaving, are you?
albus_dumbledore Oh, I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable, I would have considered it a very personal triumph if you consented to return to Hogwarts. Ah well, you're like my friend Mr. Potter here. One of a kind. Well, bye-bye Horace.
professor_horace_slughorn Bye. Alright. I'll do it. But I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water closet I had before. And I expect a raise. These are mad times we're living, mad!
albus_dumbledore They are, indeed.
harry_potter Sir, exactly what was all that about?
albus_dumbledore You are talented, famous and powerful. Everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn's gonna try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning jewel. That's why he's returning to Hogwarts. And it's crucial he should return. I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was truthfully... very pretty. The girl.
harry_potter It's alright, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse.
albus_dumbledore Oh you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.
harry_potter But sir, what about Hedwig? And my trunk?
albus_dumbledore Both are waiting for you.
ginny_weasley Hedwig? Mom?
molly_weasley Ginny, what is it?
ginny_weasley I was only wondering when Harry got here.
molly_weasley What? Harry-- Harry, who?
ginny_weasley Harry Potter, of course.
molly_weasley I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?
ginny_weasley His trunk's in the kitchen... and his owl.
molly_weasley But no, dear. I seriously doubt that.
ron_weasley Harry? Did someone say Harry?
ginny_weasley Me, nosey. Is he up there with you?
ron_weasley Of course not. I think I'll know if my best friend's in my room, wouldn't I?
hermione_granger Is that an owl I heard?
ginny_weasley You haven't seen him, have you? Apparently, he's wandering about the house.
hermione_granger Really?
harry_potter Really.
molly_weasley Harry!
hermione_granger Harry.
molly_weasley What a lovely surprise! Why didn't you let us know you were coming?
harry_potter I didn't know. Dumbledore.
molly_weasley Oh, that man! What would we without him?
ron_weasley A bit of... toothpaste.
harry_potter So when did you get here?
hermione_granger A few days ago. All though for a while, I wasn't sure I was coming.
ron_weasley Mum... sort of lost it, last week. Said Ginny and I have no business going back to Hogwarts. It's too dangerous.
harry_potter Oh, come on.
hermione_granger She's not alone. Even my parents. They're Muggles, know something bad's happening.
ron_weasley Anyway, Dad stepped in. Told us she was being barmy and... Took a few days, but she came around.
harry_potter But, this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?
hermione_granger There's been a lot of talk recently that... Dumbledore's got a bit old.
harry_potter What rubbish! Well, he's only... How old is he?
ron_weasley 150? Give or take a few years?
bellatrix_lestrange Cissy, you can't do this! He can't be trusted.
narcissa_malfoy The Dark Lord trusts him.
bellatrix_lestrange The Dark Lord is mistaken.
professor_severus_snape Run along, Wormtail.
narcissa_malfoy I-I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself forbade me to speak of this.
professor_severus_snape If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you would not to speak. Put it down, Bella, we mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it, so happens, I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.
bellatrix_lestrange You? The Dark Lord told you?
professor_severus_snape Your sister doubts me. Understandable, over the years, I've played my part well. So well, I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time. Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.
narcissa_malfoy I don't doubt you, Severus.
bellatrix_lestrange You should be honored, Cissy. As should Draco.
narcissa_malfoy He's just a boy.
professor_severus_snape I can't change the Dark Lord's mind. But it might be possible for me to help Draco.
narcissa_malfoy Severus.
bellatrix_lestrange Swear to it. Make the Unbreakable Vow. It's just empty words. You'll give it his best effort... when it matters most. He'll just slither back to his hole. Coward.
professor_severus_snape Take out your wand.
bellatrix_lestrange Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?
professor_severus_snape I will.
bellatrix_lestrange And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?
professor_severus_snape I will.
bellatrix_lestrange And if Draco should fail, will you yourself carry out the deed the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?
professor_severus_snape I will.
fred_weasley@george_weasley Step up, step up! We got fainting fancies, nosebleed nougats
fred_weasley And just in for time for school.
george_weasley Puking Pastilles.
fred_weasley@george_weasley – Into the cauldron, Handsome.
harry_potter Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
george_weasley A real money spinner, that.
fred_weasley Handy if you need to make a quick getaway.
fred_weasley@george_weasley Hello, ladies.
george_weasley Love potions, eh?
fred_weasley Yeah. They really do work. Then again the way we heard you, sis... You're doing just fine on your own.
ginny_weasley Meaning?
george_weasley Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
ginny_weasley It's none of your business.
ron_weasley How much for this?
fred_weasley@george_weasley Five galleons.
ron_weasley How much for me?
fred_weasley@george_weasley Five galleons.
ron_weasley I'm your brother.
fred_weasley@george_weasley Ten galleons.
ron_weasley Come on, let's go.
lavender_brown Hi, Ron.
ron_weasley Hi.
hermione_granger How are Fred and George doing it? Half the alley's closed down.
ron_weasley Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
harry_potter I reckon he's right.
hermione_granger Oh, no. Everyone got their wands from Ollivanders.
ron_weasley Harry... Is it me or do Draco and Mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed?
luna_lovegood Quibbler! Quibbler. He's lovely. They've been known to sing at Boxing Day, you know? Quibbler?
ginny_weasley Oh, please. What's a Wrackspurt?
luna_lovegood Invisible creatures, they flow in your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler!
harry_potter So what was Draco doing with that weird-looking cabinet? And who were all those people? Don't you see? It was a ceremony. An initiation.
hermione_granger Stop it, Harry. I know where you're going with this.
harry_potter It happened. He's one of them.
ron_weasley One of who?
hermione_granger Harry's under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
ron_weasley You're barking. What would You-Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?
harry_potter Well, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?
ron_weasley It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.
harry_potter Look, his father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense. Besides, Hermione saw it with her own eyes.
hermione_granger I told you, I don't know what I saw.
harry_potter I need some air.
draco_malfoy What was that? Blaise?
blaise_zabini Don't know.
pansy_parkinson Relax, boys. It's probably just a first-year messing around. Come, Draco. Sit down. We'll be at Hogwarts soon.
draco_malfoy Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school. I think I pitched myself off the astronomy tower if I had to continue for another 2 years.
pansy_parkinson What's that supposed to mean?
draco_malfoy Let's just say I don't think you’ll see me wasting my time in Charms class next year. Amused, Blaise? Let's see just who's laughing in the end. You two go on. I wanna check something.
hermione_granger Where's Harry?
ron_weasley He's probably on the platform. Come on.
draco_malfoy Didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus! Oh yeah... She was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin. That's for my father. Enjoy your ride back to London.
luna_lovegood Finite! Hello, Harry!
harry_potter Luna. How'd you know where I was?
luna_lovegood Wrapspurts, your head's full of them.
harry_potter Sorry I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna.
luna_lovegood That's alright. It was like being with a friend.
harry_potter Well, I am your friend, Luna.
luna_lovegood That's nice.
griphook Oh, about time. I've been looking all over for you two. Right... Names?
harry_potter Professor Flitwick, you know me for five years.
griphook No exceptions, Potter.
luna_lovegood Who are those people?
griphook Aurors for security.
argus_filch What's this cane here then?
draco_malfoy It's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick.
argus_filch And what exactly will you be doing with all... be construed as an offensive weapon.
professor_severus_snape It's alright, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.
draco_malfoy Nice face, Potter.
luna_lovegood Would you like me to fix it for you? Personally, I think you look a bit more... devil may care this way but... It's up to you.
harry_potter Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?
luna_lovegood No, but I've done several toes... and how different are they really?
harry_potter Um, okay, yeah. Give it a go.
luna_lovegood Episkey!
harry_potter How do I look?
luna_lovegood Exceptionally ordinary.
harry_potter Brilliant!
ron_weasley Hermione... he’ll be here in a minute.
hermione_granger Will you stop eating? Your best friend is missing.
ron_weasley Why won't you turn around, you lunatic?
ginny_weasley He's covered in blood again. Why is it he's always covered in blood?
ron_weasley Looks like it's his own this time.
hermione_granger Where have you been? What happened to your face?
harry_potter Later. What did I miss?
ron_weasley Sorting Hat says we ought to be brave and strong in these trouble times. Easy for it to say, though. It's a hat, isn't it?
albus_dumbledore Very best of evenings to you all. Thanks. First off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff. Horace Slughorn. Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post... as Potions Master. Meanwhile, the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts... will be taken by Professor Snape. As you know, each and every one of you were searched upon your arrival here tonight. And you have the right to know why. Once, there was a young man. Like you, sat in this very hall. Walked this castle's corridors. Slept under it's roof. You see, to all the world, a student like any other. His name: Tom Riddle. Today of course, is known all over the world by another name. Which is why as I stand, looking out upon you all tonight, I'm reminded of a sobering fact. Every day, every hour, this very minute, perhaps... dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls. But in the end, that greatest weapon... is you. Just something to think about. Now off to bed, pip-pip.
ron_weasley That was cheerful.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall History of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down. Mr. Davis, Mr. Davis, that is the girls' lavatory. Potter.
harry_potter Oh, this can't be good.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Enjoying ourselves, are we?
harry_potter I had a free period this morning, Professor.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall So I noticed. I would think you would want to fill it with Potions. Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?
harry_potter Well, it was, but I was told to have to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall So you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn's perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with "Exceeds Expectations".
harry_potter Brilliant, um... Well, I'll head there straight away.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Oh, good, good. Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.
ron_weasley I don't want to take Potions. There's Quidditch trials coming up, I need to practice.
professor_horace_slughorn Attention to detail in the preparation is the prerequisite of all plan. Harry, my boy, I've been beginning to worry. You brought someone with us, I see.
ron_weasley Ron Weasley, sir. But I'm dead awful at Potions. A menace, actually so. I'm probably just gonna—
professor_horace_slughorn Nonsense, we'll sort you out. Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out.
harry_potter I'm sorry, sir, I haven't actually got my book yet and nor is Ron.
professor_horace_slughorn Not to worry, get what you want from the cupboard. Now as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning. Any ideas what these might be? Yes, Miss...?
hermione_granger Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. It's a trutharry_pottertelling serum. And that would be Polyjuice Potion. It's terribly tricky to make. This is Amortentia. The most powerful love potion in the world. It's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them. For example, I smell... Freshly mown grass and new parchment and... Spearmint toothpaste.
professor_horace_slughorn Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love. That would be impossible, but it does cause powerful infatuation or obsession. And for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.
katie_bell Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one.
professor_horace_slughorn Oh yes. What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion, known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly known referred to as—
harry_potter Liquid luck.
professor_horace_slughorn Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck. Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong. One sip and you'll find that all of your endeavours succeed. At least until the effects wear off. So this is what I offer each of you today. One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Dead. Recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books. Issue one doubt, however. Only one set of student manage to brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize. Nevertheless, good luck to you all. Let the brewing commence.
hermione_granger How did you do that?
harry_potter You crush it, don't cut it.
hermione_granger No, the instructions specifically says to cut.
harry_potter No, really.
professor_horace_slughorn Merlin's beard! It is perfect! So perfect I'd just say one drop would kill us all! Here we are then, as promised. One vial of Felix Felicis. Congratulations. Use it well.
albus_dumbledore Oh Harry, you got my message? Come in. How are you?
harry_potter I'm fine, sir.
albus_dumbledore Enjoying your classes? I know Professor Slughorn is most impressed with you.
harry_potter I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.
albus_dumbledore Do you?
harry_potter Definitely.
albus_dumbledore What about your activities outside the classroom?
harry_potter Sir?
albus_dumbledore Well, I notice you've spent a great deal of time with Miss Granger. I can't help wondering if—
harry_potter Oh, no, no, I mean... She's brilliant and we're friends. But no.
albus_dumbledore Forgive me. I was only being curious. But enough chit-chat. You must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight. The answer lies here. What you're looking at are memories. In this case, pertaining to one individual: Voldemort. Or as he was known, then: Tom Riddle. This vial contains the most sufficient memory. On the day I first met him. I'd like you to see it. If you want.
mrs_cole I admit to some confusion for receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore. In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. There have been incidents with the other children-- Nasty things. Tom, you have a visitor.
albus_dumbledore How'd you do, Tom?
tom_marvolo_riddle Don't. You're the doctor, aren't you?
albus_dumbledore No, I'm a professor.
tom_marvolo_riddle I don't believe you. She wants me looked at. They think I'm... different.
albus_dumbledore Or perhaps they're right.
tom_marvolo_riddle I'm not mad.
albus_dumbledore Hogwarts is not a place for mad people. Hogwarts is a school. A school of magic. You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things other children can't.
tom_marvolo_riddle I can make things move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who mean to me. I can make them hurt. If I want. Who are you?
albus_dumbledore Well, I'm like you, Tom. I'm different.
tom_marvolo_riddle Prove it.
albus_dumbledore I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom. Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom. At Hogwarts, we'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it. You understand me?
tom_marvolo_riddle I can speak to snakes too. They find me. Whisper things. Is that normal for someone like me?
harry_potter Did you know, sir, then?
albus_dumbledore Did I know I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No. If I had, I... Over time while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher. Can you guess who that teacher might be?
harry_potter You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach potions, did you, sir?
albus_dumbledore No, I did not. You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something that I desire very dearly. He will not give it out easily.
harry_potter You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect to me.
albus_dumbledore I did.
harry_potter Do you want me to let him?
albus_dumbledore Yes.
harry_potter Okay, so this morning, I'm gonna be putting you all for a few drills just to assess you straight. Quiet, please!
ginny_weasley Shut it!
harry_potter Thanks. Alright, um, now then, remember, just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear? Good.
cormac_mclaggen No hard feelings, Weasley, alright?
ron_weasley Hard feelings?
cormac_mclaggen Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper's, well, It's... nothing personal.
ron_weasley Really? Strapping guy like you? You've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think? Keepers need to be quick, agile.
cormac_mclaggen I'll have my chances. Say, um, you think you could introduce me to your friend, Granger? Wouldn't mind, eh, getting on a first-hand base, you know what I mean?
crowd#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode06 Come on, come on. Go, Cormac. Come on, Ron!
harry_potter Come on, Ron.
hermione_granger Confundus.
lavender_brown Isn’t he brilliant?
ron_weasley I have to admit I thought I was going to miss that last one. I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard. He's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione-- Cormac.
hermione_granger He's vile.
harry_potter Have you ever heard of the spell: Sectumsempra?
hermione_granger No, I haven't. If you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in.
ron_weasley Not bloody likely. He's top of the class. He's even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he's a genius.
hermione_granger I'd like to know who's that book was. Let's have a look, shall we?
harry_potter No.
hermione_granger Why not?
harry_potter The binding is fragile.
hermione_granger "The binding is fragile"?
harry_potter Yeah.
ginny_weasley Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
hermione_granger Who?
ginny_weasley That's what it says right here. This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince.
hermione_granger For weeks, you carry around this book. Practically, sleep with it, and yet you have no desire to find out who the Half-Blood Prince is.
harry_potter I didn't say I wasn't curious and I don't sleep with it.
ron_weasley Well, it's true. Well, I got a nice chat before I go to bed. And all you do is that bloody book. It's like being with Hermione.
hermione_granger Well, I was curious So, I went to—
ron_weasley@harry_potter The library? And?
hermione_granger And nothing. I couldn't find a reference anywhere to the Half-Blood Prince.
harry_potter There we go. That settles it, then.
professor_horace_slughorn Yeah, uh... hoping to find you in the Three Broomsticks.
griphook Uh no, emergency choir practice from the freighthorse.
harry_potter Does anyone fancy a butterbeer?
professor_horace_slughorn A chum of mine was sledging down Clagsby Hill. We had a very long, home-made Norwegian style sledge. We hurtled down, we hit what most...
harry_potter No, sit aside me.
ron_weasley Okay.
waiter Something to drink?
hermione_granger Three butterbeers and some ginger in mine, please.
ron_weasley Oh, bloody hell. Slick git
hermione_granger Honestly Ronald, see they're only holding hands. And snogging.
ron_weasley I'd like to leave.
hermione_granger What? You can't be serious.
ron_weasley That happens to be my sister.
hermione_granger So? What if she looked at me and saw you snogging me? Would you expect her to get up and leave?
professor_horace_slughorn Hey, my boy.
harry_potter Hello sir, so wonderful to see you.
professor_horace_slughorn And you, and you.
harry_potter So what brings you here?
professor_horace_slughorn Oh, Three Broomsticks and I go way back further than I care to admit. I could remember when it was One Broomstick. All hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my boy, in the old days, I used to throw together the occasional supper party. Select a student or two. Would you be game?
harry_potter I consider it an honour, sir.
professor_horace_slughorn You'd be welcome too, Granger.
hermione_granger I'd be delighted, sir.
professor_horace_slughorn Splendid! Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby.
ron_weasley What are you playing at?
harry_potter Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him.
ron_weasley Get to know him?
harry_potter Dunno. It must be important. If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
ron_weasley Got a little bit...
leanne Katie, we don't know what it could be.
ron_weasley Harry,
harry_potter What?
katie_bell I know what I'm doing.
ron_weasley Did you hear what she was saying back in the pub there on me and her snogging?
harry_potter As if.
leanne I warned her. I warned her not to touch it.
harry_potter Don't get any closer! Get back, all of you. Do not touch that, except for the wrappings. Do you understand?
professor_minerva_mcgonagall You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks?
leanne It's like I said. She left to go to the loo. And when she came back, she had the package. She said it was important that she deliver it.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Did she say to whom?
leanne To Professor Dumbledore.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Very well. Thank you, Leanne. You may go. Why is it when something happens, it is always you three?
ron_weasley Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Oh, Severus. What do you think?
professor_horace_slughorn I think Ms. Bell is lucky to be alive.
harry_potter She was cursed, wasn't she? I know Katie. Off the Quidditch pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly. If she was delivering that to Professor Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Yes, she was cursed.
harry_potter It was Malfoy.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall That is a very serious accusation, Potter.
professor_horace_slughorn Indeed. Your evidence?
harry_potter I just know.
professor_horace_slughorn You "just" know. Once again, you're astonished with your gifts, Potter. Gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing. How grand it must be to be the Chosen One.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall I suggest you go back to your dormitories. All of you.
ron_weasley What do you see sees in him, Malfoy? And what does he see in you? Harry-- your brilliant.
harry_potter You called Malfoy a slick git not five hours ago.
ron_weasley Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my best mate, wasn't he? Something snaps. You've got to hate him, you know? On principle.
harry_potter I suppose.
ron_weasley So what do you see in him?
harry_potter I don't know. He’s smart, funny, attractive—
ron_weasley Attractive?
harry_potter You know, He’s got nice skin.
ron_weasley Skin? You're saying your dating Malfoy because of his skin?
harry_potter For- well, I mean. I'm just--I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.
ron_weasley Hermione's got nice skin. When you say it, as skin goes, I mean.
harry_potter I've never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice. I think I'll be going to sleep now.
ron_weasley Right.
professor_horace_slughorn So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your uncle Tiberius these days?
cormac_mclaggen Yes, sir, in fact I'm meant to get hunting with him and the Minister of Magic over the holidays.
professor_horace_slughorn Oh, well, be sure to give them both my best. And what about your uncle, Belby? For those of you who don't know well, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion. Is he working on anything new?
marcus_belby I don't know. He and my dad don't get along. 'Prolly cause my dad says potions are rubbish. His only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day.
professor_horace_slughorn And what about you, Ms. Granger, what exactly does your family do in the Muggle world?
hermione_granger My parents are dentists. They tend to people's teeth.
professor_horace_slughorn Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?
hermione_granger No. Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwich, did bite my father once. He needed ten stitches.
professor_horace_slughorn Ah, Ms. Weasley. Come in, come in.
hermione_granger Look, her eyes. They've been fighting again. Her and Dean.
ginny_weasley Sorry, I'm not usually late.
professor_horace_slughorn No matter, just in time for dessert. That is if Belby has left you any.
harry_potter What?
hermione_granger Nothing.
professor_horace_slughorn Goodbye. Bye-bye. Potter!
harry_potter I'm sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass.
professor_horace_slughorn Ah yes, most intriguing object. The sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation. It is stimulating, the sand runs slowly. If it is not...
harry_potter I think I'll be going, then.
professor_horace_slughorn Nonsense. You have nothing to fear, dear boy. Actually, some of your classmates... Well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.
harry_potter Shelf, sir?
professor_horace_slughorn Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here. But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?
harry_potter Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.
professor_horace_slughorn Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers who was here at Hogwarts.
harry_potter What was he like? I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents.
professor_horace_slughorn Of course, it's only natural you should want to know more. But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet, albeit brilliant boy, committed to becoming a first-grade wizard. Not unlike others I've known. Not unlike yourself, in fact. If the monster existed, it was very deep within.
neville_longbottom Good luck eh, Ron?
seamus_finnigan I'm counting on you, Ron. I've 2 games on Gryffindor, ya?
crowd#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode06 Be good, Ron. Loser! What's he wearing?
ron_weasley So how was it, then?
hermione_granger How is what?
ron_weasley Your dinner party?
hermione_granger Pretty boring actually. But I think Harry enjoyed dessert. Slughorn's having Christmas, do you know? I'm about to bring someone.
ron_weasley I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?
hermione_granger Actually, I was going to ask you.
ron_weasley Really?
lavender_brown Good luck today, Ron. I know you'll be brilliant.
ron_weasley I'm resigning. After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot.
harry_potter Have it your way, juice?
ron_weasley Sure.
luna_lovegood Hello, everyone. You look dreadful, Ron. Is that why you put something in his cup? Is it a tonic?
hermione_granger Liquid luck. Don't drink it, Ron. You could be expelled for that.
harry_potter What are we talking about?
ron_weasley Come on, Harry, we've got a game to win.
crowd#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode06 Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
hermione_granger You shouldn't have done it.
harry_potter I know. I supposed I could have just used the Confundus charm.
hermione_granger That was different. That was try-outs, this was an actual game. You didn't put in? Ron only thought you did.
hermione_granger Charm spell, I’m just practising.
harry_potter They’re really good.
hermione_granger How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny? I know. I see the way you look at her. You're my best friend.
lavender_brown Oops! I think this room's taken.
ron_weasley What's with the birds?
hermione_granger Oppugno.
harry_potter It feels like this.
ron_weasley I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist. What Lav and I have, well, let's just say, there's no stopping it. It's chemical. Will it last? Who knows? Point is I'm a free agent.
hermione_granger He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes. I really couldn't care less. Was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together? Yes. Now, given the circumstances, I had to make other arrangements.
harry_potter Have you?
hermione_granger Yes. Why?
harry_potter Well, I just thought seeing is not the risk at going with who we'd really like to, We should go together, as friends.
hermione_granger Why didn't I think of that?
harry_potter Who are you going with?
hermione_granger Um, it's a surprise. Anyways, you have got to worry about. You can't take just anyone. See that girl over there? That's Romilda Vane. Harry, she's been been trying to smuggle you a love potion.
harry_potter Really?
hermione_granger Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.
harry_potter But I am the Chosen One. Okay, sorry, um... Kidding. I'll ask someone I like. Someone cool.
luna_lovegood I've never been to this part of the castle. At least, not while awake. I sleep-walk, you see. That's why I wear shoes to bed.
draco_malfoy Harmonia Nectere Passus. Harmonia Nectere Passus. Harmonia Nectere Passus.
nymphadora_tonks Drink?
harry_potter Neville.
nymphadora_tonks I didn't get into the Slug Club. It's okay, though. He's got Belby hanging up towels in the looroom.
harry_potter I'm--I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
nymphadora_tonks Okay.
harry_potter Hermione, what are you doing? What happened to you?
hermione_granger No, I've just escaped. I mean, I left Cormac under the mistletoe.
harry_potter Cormac? That's who you invited?
hermione_granger I thought it would annoy Ron the most.
professor_severus_snape Thank you. I’ll catch up with you later.
hermione_granger He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.
waiter Dragon tartare?
hermione_granger No, I'm fine, thank you.
waiter Just as well. They give one horribly bad breath.
hermione_granger On second thoughts, it might keep Cormac away. God, here he comes.
harry_potter I think she just went to powder her nose.
cormac_mclaggen Slippery little minx, your friend. Likes to work mouth too, doesn’t she? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is this I'm eating, by the way? Dragon balls.
professor_severus_snape You've just brought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen. Not so quick, Potter.
harry_potter Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date—
professor_severus_snape Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two. Besides, I only wish to convey a message.
harry_potter A message?
professor_severus_snape From Professor Dumbledore. He asked me to give you his best and he hopes you enjoy your holidays. You see... He's travelling. And he won't return until term resumes.
harry_potter Travelling where?
professor_severus_snape How are you?
draco_malfoy Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib.
argus_filch Professor Slughorn, sir. I just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party.
draco_malfoy Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy?
professor_severus_snape I'll escort him out.
draco_malfoy Certainly, Professor.
professor_severus_snape Alright, everyone carry on, carry on.
draco_malfoy Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't. What’s it to you?
professor_severus_snape I swore to protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow.
draco_malfoy I don't need protection. I was chosen for this. Out of all others, me, and I won't fail him.
professor_severus_snape You're afraid, Draco. You attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious, let me assist you.
draco_malfoy No. I was chosen. This is my moment.
ron_weasley Unbreakable Vow. You sure that's what Snape said?
harry_potter Positive. Why?
ron_weasley It's just, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow.
harry_potter I-I worked that much out for myself, funny enough.
ron_weasley You don't understand. Oh bloody hell.
luna_lovegood I miss you.
harry_potter Lovely.
ron_weasley All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped, look.
harry_potter Then I'll take your word for it. So what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow?
ron_weasley You die.
remus_lupin Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?
harry_potter I know it sounds mad.
remus_lupin Has it occured to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so he could find out what he was up to?
molly_weasley Ginny!
harry_potter That's not what it sounded like.
nymphadora_tonks Perhaps Harry is right, Remus. I mean, to make an Unbreakable Vow—
remus_lupin It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore, I do.
harry_potter Dumbledore can make mistakes. He said so himself.
remus_lupin You are blinded by hatred.
harry_potter I'm not.
remus_lupin Yes, you are. People are disappearing, Harry. Daily. We could only place our trust in a handful of people. If we started fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed.
molly_weasley Ginny!
ginny_weasley Open up, you. Don't you trust me?
harry_potter It's good.
ron_weasley Yeah, I’ll just, get, yeah... Pie?
harry_potter Not for me. No.
arthur_weasley You'll have to forgive Remus. It takes its toll, his condition.
harry_potter Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?
arthur_weasley We're being followed, all of us. Most days, Molly doesn't leave the house. It's not been easy.
harry_potter Did you get my owl?
arthur_weasley Yes, I did. If Dumbledore is traveling, then perhaps news to the Ministry, but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it. As for Draco Malfoy... I know a bit more.
harry_potter Go on.
arthur_weasley I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes. I think from what you described... What you and Ron saw at the end of summer, the object that Draco is so interested in, is a Vanishing Cabinet.
harry_potter A "Vanishing Cabinet"?
arthur_weasley They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can see the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come knocking, one simply have to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two. It transports you practically anywhere. Tricky contraptions, though. Very temperamental.
harry_potter What happened to it? The one at Borgin and Burkes?
arthur_weasley Nothing. It's still there.
nymphadora_tonks It was delicious, Molly, really.
molly_weasley Are you sure you won't stay?
nymphadora_tonks No, we should go. The first night of the cycle's always the worst.
arthur_weasley Remus?
nymphadora_tonks Sweetheart.
ginny_weasley Has Ron gone to bed?
harry_potter Um, not yet. No.
ginny_weasley Shoelace... Merry Christmas, Harry.
harry_potter Merry Christmas.
arthur_weasley Harry, no! Harry!
nymphadora_tonks Remus.
molly_weasley Ginny!
bellatrix_lestrange I killed Sirius Black! I killed Sirius Black! You coming to get me? Harry, can you get me? You coming to get me!
ginny_weasley Harry?
harry_potter Stupefy!
hermione_granger It's so easy for them to get to you. You're bloody lucky you weren't killed. You have to realise who you are, Harry!
harry_potter I know who I am, Hermione, alright. Sorry.
ron_weasley Lav, come on. Of course I’ll wear it.
lavender_brown That's my Won-Won.
hermione_granger Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.
professor_horace_slughorn I’d like to know where you get your information. More knowledgable than half the staff, you are.
tom_marvolo_riddle Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?
professor_horace_slughorn Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I? And by the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right. It is my favorite. But how did you know?
tom_marvolo_riddle Intuition.
professor_horace_slughorn Good gracious, is it that time already? Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention. Look sharp, Tom. Don't be caught out of bed after hours. Is something on your mind, Tom?
tom_marvolo_riddle Yes, sir. See, I couldn’t think of anyone else to go to. The other professors... Well, they're not like you. They might misunderstand.
professor_horace_slughorn Go on.
tom_marvolo_riddle I was in the library the other night. In the restricted section. And I picked something rather odd about this rare magic. I thought perhaps, you could illuminate me. It's called, as I understand it, Hor...
professor_horace_slughorn I beg your pardon? I don't know anything about such things and if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Now get out of here at once and don't let me ever catch you mentioning them again!
albus_dumbledore Confused? I'd be surprised if you weren't.
harry_potter I don't understand. What happened?
albus_dumbledore This is perhaps the most important memory I had collected. It is also a lie. This memory has been tempered with by the same person whose memory it is. Our old friend, Professor Slughorn.
harry_potter But why would he temper with his own memory?
albus_dumbledore I suspect he's ashamed of it.
harry_potter Why?
albus_dumbledore Why, indeed. I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you had done so. Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory. Any way you can.
harry_potter I don't know him that well, sir.
albus_dumbledore This memory is everything. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance. You have no choice. You must not fail.
professor_horace_slughorn I highly recommend, reacquaint yourself with the chapter on antidotes. Now, I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. Right, off you go. Elise, don't forget your rat tail. Aha! It isn't the Prince of Potions himself! What do I owe this pleasure?
harry_potter Oh, sir, I wondered if I wanted to ask you something.
professor_horace_slughorn Ask away, dear boy. Ask away.
harry_potter Well, you see the other day, I was in the library in the restricted section, and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic.
professor_horace_slughorn Yes, what was this rare piece of magic? Well, I don't know, but I can't remember the name exactly.
harry_potter But it just got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us?
professor_horace_slughorn I'm Potions Master, Harry, I think your question better be posed to Professor Snape.
harry_potter Yes, he and I don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to say is... Well, he's not like you. He might misunderstand.
professor_horace_slughorn Yes, it would be no light without the dark. And so it is with magic, myself I always strive to live within the light. I suggest you do the same.
harry_potter Is that what you told Tom Riddle, sir, when he came asking questions?
professor_horace_slughorn Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he? Didn't he? Yes? Oh, it's you, Potter. I-I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.
arthur_weasley Harry! Ginny! Molly.
ron_weasley That's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.
harry_potter Divine. Had ourselves a little late night snack, did we?
ron_weasley It was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one.
harry_potter Or twenty?
ron_weasley I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.
harry_potter Honestly, you know, I reckon she was starting to annoy you.
ron_weasley She could never annoy me. I think I love her.
harry_potter Well, brilliant.
ron_weasley Do you think she knows I exist?
harry_potter I very well hope so. She's been snogging you for three months.
ron_weasley Snogging? Who are you talking about?
harry_potter Who are you talking about?
ron_weasley Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.
harry_potter Okay, very funny. What was that for?
ron_weasley It's no joke. I'm in love with her!
harry_potter Alright, fine. You're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her?
ron_weasley No. Can you introduce me?
harry_potter Come on, Ron. I going to introduce you to Romilda Vane. I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential.
ron_weasley Where's Romilda?
professor_horace_slughorn What's the matter with Wenby?
harry_potter Very powerful love potion.
professor_horace_slughorn Very well, better bring him in. I always thought you could whip up a remedy for this is in no time, Harry.
harry_potter Well, I-I thought this called for more practised hands, sir.
ron_weasley Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?
professor_horace_slughorn Perhaps, you're right.
harry_potter I'm sorry, by the way, Professor, about earlier today. Our misunderstanding.
professor_horace_slughorn Oh, not at all. Old water under the bridge, you know. Correct?
harry_potter Well, I expect you're tired a bit, after all these years. And the questions about Voldemort.
professor_horace_slughorn Don't use that name! Here you go, boy. Bottom's up.
ron_weasley What's this?
professor_horace_slughorn Tonic for the nerves.
ron_weasley What happened to me?
harry_potter A love potion.
professor_horace_slughorn A bloody strong one at that.
ron_weasley I feel really bad.
professor_horace_slughorn You need to pick me up, my boy. Got butterbeer, wine, dazzling oak-matured mead. I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances. Here you are, Potter. To life!
harry_potter Ron! Ron! Professor, do something.
professor_horace_slughorn I-I don't understand!
harry_potter Come on, Ron, breathe!
ron_weasley These girls... They're gonna kill me.
albus_dumbledore Quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar. You should be very proud of your student, Horace.
professor_horace_slughorn Ah, yes. Very proud.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall I think we agree Potter's actions were heroic. The question is: Why were they necessary?
albus_dumbledore Why, indeed. This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't remember who gave you this bottle? By the way, it possesses remarkably subtle hints of liquorice and cherry. When not polluted with poison.
professor_horace_slughorn Actually, I had intended to give it as a gift, myself.
albus_dumbledore To whom, might I ask?
professor_horace_slughorn To you, headmaster.
lavender_brown Where is he? Where's my Won-Won? Has he been asking for me? What's she doing here?
hermione_granger I might ask you the same question.
lavender_brown I happen to be his girlfriend.
hermione_granger And I happen to be his... friend.
lavender_brown Don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks. I suppose you want to make up with him now that he's suddenly all interesting.
hermione_granger He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting.
lavender_brown Ah see? He senses my presence. Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here. I'm here.
ron_weasley Hermione. Hermione. Hermione.
albus_dumbledore Oh to be young and to feel love's keen sting. Well, come away, everybody. Mr. Weasley's well attended.
ginny_weasley About time, don't you think?
harry_potter Thank you.
hermione_granger Oh, shut up.
hermione_granger Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.
ron_weasley Tell me how I broke up with Lavender again.
hermione_granger Well, she came to visit you in the hospital. And you talked. I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation.
ron_weasley Don't get me wrong. I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her. It’s just she seems a bit... put out.
hermione_granger Yes, um... She does, doesn't she? You say you don't remember anything from that night. Anything at all?
ron_weasley There is something. It can't be. I was completely boggled, wasn't I?
hermione_granger Boggled. Harry... That's Katie. Katie Bell.
harry_potter Katie, how are you?
katie_bell I know you're going to ask, Harry. But I don't know who cursed me. I've been trying to remember. Honestly. But I just can't.
leanne Katie.
harry_potter I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her, didn't you? Sectumsempra!
professor_severus_snape Vulnera Sanentur. Vulnera Sanentur. Vulnera Sanentur.
ginny_weasley You have to get rid of it. Today. Take my hand.
harry_potter The Room of Requirement.
ginny_weasley We need to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book. Where no one'll ever find it. Including you.
harry_potter@ginny_weasley What was that?
ginny_weasley See, you never know what you'll find up here. Alright, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted. Close your eyes. That can stay hidden up here too if you like.
ron_weasley So, did you and Ginny do it then?
harry_potter What?
ron_weasley Well, hide the book?
harry_potter Oh, yeah.
professor_severus_snape Oh, dear yes…
ron_weasley Still no luck with Slughorn then, I take it?
harry_potter Luck. That's it. All I need is a bit of luck.
hermione_granger Well, how do you feel?
harry_potter Excellent. Really excellent.
hermione_granger Remember, Slughorn usually leaves early, takes a walk, and then returns to his office.
harry_potter Right. I'm going down to Hagrid's.
hermione_granger What? No, Harry, you've got to go to speak to Slughorn. We have a plan.
harry_potter I know but I've got a really good feeling about Hagrid's. I feel it's--it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean?
hermione_granger@ron_weasley – No.
harry_potter Well, trust me. I know what I'm doing. Or Felix does. Hi!
professor_horace_slughorn Merlin's beard, Harry!
harry_potter Sorry, sir. I should’ve announced myself. Clear my throat. Coughed. You probably thought I was Professor Sprout?
professor_horace_slughorn Definitely. What makes you think?
harry_potter Ah well, just your general behaviour, sir. Just sneaking around, jumping when you saw me. Are those tentacular leaves, sir?
professor_horace_slughorn Yes.
harry_potter They're very valuable, aren't they?
professor_horace_slughorn Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer. Not that I'm familiar with any such back alley transactions but one does hear rumours. My only interests are purely academical.
harry_potter I mean, personally, these plants always kinda freak me out.
professor_horace_slughorn Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?
harry_potter Through the front door, sir. I'm off to Hagrid's, you see. He's a very dear friend and I just fancy paying him a visit. So if you don't mind, I will be going now.
professor_horace_slughorn Harry!
harry_potter Sir?
professor_horace_slughorn It's nearly nightfall. Surely, you realise I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself.
harry_potter Well then, by all means, come along, sir.
professor_horace_slughorn Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!
harry_potter That would be counterproductive, sir.
professor_horace_slughorn And what makes you say that?
harry_potter No idea.
rubeus_hagrid Horace.
professor_horace_slughorn Merlin's beard! Is that an actual Acromantula?
harry_potter A dead one, I think, sir.
professor_horace_slughorn Good God. Dear fellow, however did you manage to kill it?
rubeus_hagrid "Kill it"? My oldest friend, he was.
professor_horace_slughorn I'm so sorry, I didn't—
rubeus_hagrid Ah, don't worry yourself. You're not alone. Seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are. The eyes I reckon, they unnerve some folk.
harry_potter Not to mention the pincers.
rubeus_hagrid Yeah, I reckon that too.
professor_horace_slughorn Hagrid... The last thing I wish to be is indelicate but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare. Would you allow me to extract a vial or two, purely for academic purposes, you understand?
rubeus_hagrid Well I don't suppose it's gonna do him much good now is it.
professor_horace_slughorn My thoughts exactly. I have an ampoule or two about my person for just such occassions as this. Old... Potion master's habit, you know?
rubeus_hagrid I wish you could have seen him with his prime. Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.
professor_horace_slughorn Would you like me to say a few words?
rubeus_hagrid Yes.
professor_horace_slughorn Had a family, I trust?
harry_potter Oh, yeah.
professor_horace_slughorn Farewell...
rubeus_hagrid Aragog.
professor_horace_slughorn Farewell, Aragog. King of the arachnids. Your body will decay... but your spirit lingers on and your human friends find solace, the loss they have sustained.
rubeus_hagrid@professor_horace_slughorn Laid to rest, And his wand, snapped in two, which was sad.
rubeus_hagrid I had him from an egg, you know? Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. No bigger than a Pekingese. A Pekingese, mind you.
professor_horace_slughorn How sweet! I once had a fish. Francis. He was very dear to me. One afternoon, I came downstairs and... it vanished. Poof.
rubeus_hagrid That's very odd, isn't it?
professor_horace_slughorn It is, isn't it? But that's life! I suppose, you--you go along with and suddenly... poof.
rubeus_hagrid Poof.
harry_potter Poof.
professor_horace_slughorn It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon, I discovered the bowl on my desk... With just a few inches of clear water in it... And floating on the surface was a flower petal. As I watched, it sank. But just before it reached the bottom, it transformed into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic. Wondrous to behold. The flower petal had come from a lily. Your mother. The day I came downstairs, the day the bowl was empty. That's the day your mother... I know why you're here. But I can't help you. It would ruin me.
harry_potter Do you know why I survived, Professor? The night I got this? Because of her, because she sacrificed herself... Because she refused to step aside. Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
professor_horace_slughorn Don't say his name.
harry_potter I'm not afraid of the name, Professor. I'm going to tell you something. Something others have only guessed at. It's true. I am the Chosen One. Only I can destroy him, but in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you all those years ago in your office and I need to know what you told him. Be brave, Professor. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise, you disgrace her. Otherwise, she died for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl will remain empty forever.
professor_horace_slughorn Please, don't think badly of me when you see it. I had no idea what he was like, even then.
tom_marvolo_riddle I was in the library the other day. In the restricted section... and I read something rather odd about this rare magic. It's called, as I understand it, a Horcrux.
professor_horace_slughorn I beg your pardon?
tom_marvolo_riddle Horcrux. I came across the term while reading... and I didn't fully understand it.
professor_horace_slughorn I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but this is very dark stuff. Very dark, indeed.
tom_marvolo_riddle Which is... why I came to you.
professor_horace_slughorn A horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
tom_marvolo_riddle But I don't understand how that works, sir.
professor_horace_slughorn One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you are protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed.
tom_marvolo_riddle Protected?
professor_horace_slughorn That part of your soul which is hidden lives on. In other words, you cannot die.
tom_marvolo_riddle And how does one splits his soul, sir?
professor_horace_slughorn I think you already know the answer to that, Tom.
tom_marvolo_riddle Murder.
professor_horace_slughorn Yes, killing rips the soul apart and it is a violation against nature.
tom_marvolo_riddle Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven—
professor_horace_slughorn Seven? Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person? To rip the soul in seven pieces! This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic?
tom_marvolo_riddle Of course, sir. It'll be our little secret.
harry_potter Sir.
albus_dumbledore This is beyond anything I imagined.
harry_potter Do you mean, sir, he succeeded, sir? In making a Horcrux?
albus_dumbledore Oh yes, he succeeded, alright. And not just once.
harry_potter What are they exactly?
albus_dumbledore It could be anything. Most common place of objects. A ring, for example, or a book.
harry_potter Tom Riddle's diary.
albus_dumbledore It's a horcrux, yes. Four years ago when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this. I knew then, this was a different kind of magic. Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful...
harry_potter And the ring?
albus_dumbledore Belonged to Voldemort's mother. Difficult to find. Even more difficult to destroy.
harry_potter But if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux—
albus_dumbledore One destroys Voldemort.
harry_potter How would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they?
albus_dumbledore True, but magic, especially dark magic... leaves traces.
harry_potter It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir? When you leave the school.
albus_dumbledore Yes, and I think perhaps, I may have found another. But this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone. Once again, I must ask too much of you, Harry.
professor_horace_slughorn Have you ever considered that you ask too much, that you take too much for granted? Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?
albus_dumbledore Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant. I will not negotiate with you, Severus. You agreed. Nothing more to discuss. Oh, Harry... You need a shave, my friend. You know, at times, I forget how much you've grown. At times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I'm an old man.
harry_potter You still look the same to me, sir.
albus_dumbledore Just like your mother, you are unfailingly kind. A trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid. The place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous. I promise you for the company of me and I stand by that promise. But there's one condition. You must obey every command I give you without question.
harry_potter Yes, sir.
albus_dumbledore You do understand what I'm saying. Should I tell you to hide, you hide. Should I tell you to run, you run. Should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so. Your word, Harry.
harry_potter My word.
albus_dumbledore Take my arm.
harry_potter Sir, I thought you couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts.
albus_dumbledore Well, being me has its privileges. This is the place. Oh, yes. This place has known magic.
harry_potter Sir.
albus_dumbledore In order to gain passage, payment must be made. Payment intended to weaken any intruder.
harry_potter You should have let me, sir.
albus_dumbledore No, no, Harry. Your blood's much more precious than mine. Voldemort would not have made it easy to discover his hiding place. He would put certain defenses in position. Careful. There it is. The only question is how do we get there? If you would, Harry.
harry_potter Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?
albus_dumbledore Oh, yes. It has to be drunk. All of it has to be drunk. You remember the conditions on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me. May make me forget what I'm doing here. Might cause me so much pain that I beg for relief. You are not to indulge these requests. It's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion. Even if you have to force it down my throat. Understood?
harry_potter Why can't I drink it, sir?
albus_dumbledore Because I'm much older, much cleverer and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry.
harry_potter Professor. Professor!
albus_dumbledore Harry.
harry_potter Professor. Can you hear me? Professor!
albus_dumbledore No. Don’t
harry_potter You have to keep drinking like you said, remember?
albus_dumbledore Stop.
harry_potter I will stop. I will stop. But only-- only if you keep drinking.
albus_dumbledore Don't make me--
harry_potter I'm sorry, sir.
albus_dumbledore Kill me. Kill me! All my fault. My fault.
harry_potter Just one more, sir. One more, I promise. I promise I'll do what you say.
albus_dumbledore No, no.
harry_potter I promise! Please!
albus_dumbledore Harry. Water. Water.
harry_potter Water. Look, you did it, sir. Look.
albus_dumbledore Harry... water.
harry_potter Aguamenti!
albus_dumbledore Water.
harry_potter Lumos. Lumos maxima! Stupefy!
albus_dumbledore Harry
harry_potter Sectumsempra! Stupefy!
albus_dumbledore Harry...
harry_potter Incarcerous! Stupefy!
albus_dumbledore Harry... Harry... Partis Temporus!
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Go to your houses! No dawdling!
harry_potter We need to get you to the hospital wing, sir to Madam Pomfrey.
albus_dumbledore No... Severus, Severus is who I need. Wake him. Tell him what happened. Speak to no one else. Severus, Harry. Hide yourself below, Harry. Don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission. Whatever happens, it's imperative you stay below. Harry, do as I say. Trust me. Trust me. Good evening, Draco. What brings you here on this fine spring evening?
draco_malfoy Who else is here? I heard you talking.
albus_dumbledore I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful. Have you always been to yourself, Draco? Draco, you are no assassin.
draco_malfoy How do you know what I am? I've done things that would shock you.
albus_dumbledore Oh, like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she would bear a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one lace with poison. Forgive me, Draco, I cannot help feel these actions are so weak that your... heart can't really have been in.
draco_malfoy He trusts me. I was chosen.
albus_dumbledore I shall make it easy for you.
draco_malfoy Expelliarmus!
albus_dumbledore Very good. Very good. You're not alone. There are others. How?
draco_malfoy The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. I've been mending it.
albus_dumbledore Let me guess, it has a sister.
draco_malfoy A twin. In Borgin and Burkes. They form a passage.
albus_dumbledore Ingenious. Draco, years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. Please let me help you.
draco_malfoy I don't want your help. Don't you understand? I have to do this. I have to kill you. Or he's gonna kill me.
bellatrix_lestrange Well, look what we have here. Well done, Draco.
albus_dumbledore Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order, don't you?
bellatrix_lestrange Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're on a bit of tight schedule. Do it!
fenrir_greyback He doesn't have the stomach. Just like his father. Let me finish him in my own way.
bellatrix_lestrange No, the Dark Lord was clear the boy has to do it. This is your moment, Draco. Do it! Go on, Draco, now!
professor_severus_snape No.
albus_dumbledore Severus. Please...
professor_severus_snape Avada Kedavra.
bellatrix_lestrange Yeah.
bellatrix_lestrange Hagrid, hello?
harry_potter Snape, he trusted you!
professor_severus_snape Go on!
harry_potter Incarcerous! Fight back, you coward! Fight back!
professor_severus_snape No, he belongs to the Dark Lord.
harry_potter Sectumsempra!
professor_severus_snape You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? Yes, I'm the Half-Blood Prince.
professor_minerva_mcgonagall Potter... In light of what has happened. If you should have the need to talk to someone... You should know... Professor Dumbledore... You meant a great deal to him.
hermione_granger Do you think he would have done it? Draco.
harry_potter No. No, he was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always Snape. I did nothing. It’s fake. Open it.
hermione_granger ‘To the Dark Lord: I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more. R.A.B.’ R.A.B.?
harry_potter Don't know. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. It means it was all a waste. All of it.
hermione_granger Ron's okay with you, you know. You and Ginny. If I were you when he's around, I'd keep snogging to a minimum.
harry_potter I'm not coming back, Hermione. I got to finish whatever Dumbledore started. And I don't know where that'll leave me, but I'll let you and Ron know where I am... when I can.
hermione_granger I've always admired your courage, Harry. But sometimes, you can be really thick. You don't really think you're going to be able to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry.
harry_potter I never realised how beautiful this place was.

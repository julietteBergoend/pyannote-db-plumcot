old#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 man Bloody kids.
wormtail Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... perhaps if we were to do it without the boy..
lord_voldemort NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say.
unknown#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 man I will not disappoint you my lord.
lord_voldemort Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door.
lord_voldemort Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
hermione_granger Harry!
hermione_granger Are you alright?
hermione_granger Just now. You?
harry_potter Last night.
hermione_granger Wake up. Wake up Ronald!
ron_weasley Bloody hell.
hermione_granger Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready.
harry_potter Where are we actually going?
ron_weasley Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?
arthur_weasley Haven't the foggiest, keep up!
amos_diggory Arthur! It's about time son.
arthur_weasley Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory everyone, he works with me at the ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?
cedric_diggory Yes sir.
amos_diggory Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter.
harry_potter Yes sir. This way.
amos_diggory Great great pleasure.
harry_potter Pleasure to meet you too sir.
arthur_weasley That's it sir, just over there.
amos_diggory Shall we? We don't want to be late.
harry_potter Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?
fred_weasley That isn't just any old manky boot mate.
george_weasley It's a portkey.
amos_diggory Time to go. Ready?
harry_potter What's a 'portkey'?
amos_diggory After 3. One... Two...
arthur_weasley Harry!
amos_diggory Three!
arthur_weasley Let go kids!
hermione_granger What??
arthur_weasley Let! Go!
arthur_weasley I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?
harry_potter Thanks.
arthur_weasley Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!
amos_diggory Parting of the waves I think old chap, see you at the match.
harry_potter See ya later Cedric.
arthur_weasley Home sweet home.
arthur_weasley Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen we're all hungry.
twins#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.
arthur_weasley Feet off the table.
twins#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Feet off the table.
harry_potter I love magic.
ron_weasley Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?
lucius_malfoy Well put it this way, if it rains... you'll be the first to know
draco_malfoy Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself.
lucius_malfoy Don't boast Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself won't you. While you can.
arthur_weasley Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for.
george_weasley Come on!
fred_weasley It's the Irish!
george_weasley Here come the Bulgarians!
weasleys#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Krum!!!
george_weasley Yes!
announcer#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Good evening! It gives me great pleasure to welcome each and every one of you to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup. Let the match begin!
ron_weasley There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist.
ginny_weasley Think you're in love Ron?
twins#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!
boys#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
fred_weasley Sounds like the irish have got their pride on.
arthur_weasley Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now.
arthur_weasley Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred, George... Ginny is your responsibility.
ron_weasley Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.
harry_potter What is THAT?
arthur_weasley Stop! That's my son.
arthur_weasley Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?
barty_crouch Which of you conjured this?
arthur_weasley You can't possibly..
barty_crouch Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!
harry_potter Crime?
arthur_weasley Barty, they're just kids.
harry_potter What crime?
hermione_granger Harry it's his mark.
harry_potter Those people tonight, in the masks... they're his too aren't they? they're his followers.
barty_crouch Follow me.
harry_potter There was a man. Before. There.
barty_crouch All of you, this way.
arthur_weasley Harry, who?
harry_potter I dunno. I didn't see his face.
lady#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 offscreen Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley?
lady#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Anything from the trolley dears?
ron_weasley Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
ron_weasley On second thought, just the drewbals.
harry_potter It's alright I'll get it.
ron_weasley Just the drewbals, thanks.
cho_chang Two pumpkin pasties please.
cho_chang Thank you.
lady#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Anything sweet for you dear?
harry_potter Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.
hermione_granger This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?
ron_weasley Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.
hermione_granger It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.
harry_potter I'm fine.
hermione_granger You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream.
hagrid Clear the runway.
harry_potter Well there's something you don't see every day.
albus_dumbledore Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...
albus_dumbledore So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime.
student#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Blimey, that's one big woman.
albus_dumbledore And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff.
ron_weasley Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!
igor_karkaroff Albus!
albus_dumbledore Igor.
madame_olympe_maxime Professor Dumbledore, my horses have travelled a long way. They will need attending to.
albus_dumbledore Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them.
madame_olympe_maxime But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink only single malt whiskey.
man#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 You idiot!
albus_dumbledore Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.
fred_weasley Wicked.
albus_dumbledore For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch.
ron_weasley Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.
hermione_granger Alastor Moody? The aura.
ron_weasley He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.
albus_dumbledore My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
alastor_moody That stupid roof.
pupil#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 What's that he's drinking do you suppose?
harry_potter I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice.
barty_crouch After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final.
george_weasley That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!
albus_dumbledore Silence!
albus_dumbledore The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun.
alastor_moody Alastor Moody.
alastor_moody Ministry malcontent. And your new defence against the dark arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions?When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are?
hermione_granger Three sir.
alastor_moody And they are so named?
hermione_granger Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will...
alastor_moody Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against, you need to be prepared, you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk Mr Finnigan!
pupil#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Aw no way, the old codger can see out the back of his head.
alastor_moody So, which curse shall we see first?WEASLEY!
ron_weasley Yes...
alastor_moody Give us a curse.
ron_weasley Well, my dad did tell me about one... The Imperius curse.
alastor_moody Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why.
alastor_moody Hello. What a little beauty.
alastor_moody Don't worry. Completely harmless.
alastor_moody But if she bites... she's lethal!
alastor_moody What are you laughing at?
alastor_moody Talented isn't she? What shall I have her do next? Jump out the window? Drown herself?
alastor_moody Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the Imperius curse. But here's the rub, how do we sort out the liars? Another.. another.. Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up.
alastor_moody Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology.
neville_longbottom There's the um... The Cruciatus curse.
alastor_moody Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse.
hermione_granger Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!
alastor_moody Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse Miss Granger.
alastor_moody The killing curse. Only one person is known to have survived it. And he's sitting in this room.
ron_weasley Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know.
hermione_granger There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face.
hermione_granger Neville?
alastor_moody Son. You alright?
alastor_moody Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something.
ron_weasley Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen.
harry_potter Yeah well rather you than me.
george_weasley Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it.
fred_weasley Cooked it up just this morning.
hermione_granger It's not going to work.
fred_weasley Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.
hermione_granger You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.
fred_weasley So?
hermione_granger So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.
george_weasley That's why it's so brilliant.
george_weasley Ready Fred?
fred_weasley Ready George?
george_weasley You said..
albus_dumbledore Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!
albus_dumbledore The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!
albus_dumbledore The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour
albus_dumbledore The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.
albus_dumbledore Excellent! we now have our three champions!But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!
albus_dumbledore Harry Potter. Harry Potter?
hagrid No... No.
albus_dumbledore Harry Potter!
hermione_granger Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.
voice#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen yet.
albus_dumbledore Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?
harry_potter No sir.
albus_dumbledore Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?
harry_potter No sir.
albus_dumbledore You're absolutely sure?
harry_potter Yes sir.
madame_olympe_maxime Well of course he is lying.
alastor_moody The hell he is. The goblet of fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object, only an exceptionally powerful conjurer could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year.
igor_karkaroff You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye.
alastor_moody It was once my job to think as dark wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?
albus_dumbledore That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty.
barty_crouch The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion.
professor_mcgonagall This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this?
albus_dumbledore What do you suggest Minerva?
professor_mcgonagall Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.
albus_dumbledore You heard Barty the rules are clear.
professor_mcgonagall Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accomodate them...
professor_snape Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold.
professor_mcgonagall Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat.
albus_dumbledore I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?
alastor_moody I can do that.
albus_dumbledore Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are.
ron_weasley How did you do it?
ron_weasley Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.
harry_potter Let you know what?
ron_weasley You know bloody well what.
harry_potter I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.
ron_weasley Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend.
harry_potter I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't WANT eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok.
ron_weasley Piss off.
rita_skeeter What a charismatic quartet. Hello!
rita_skeeter I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily prophet. But of course you know that don't you. It's you we don't know, you're the news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles mask? does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick. Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we start with the youngest. Lovely.
rita_skeeter This is cosy.
harry_potter It's a broomcupboard.
rita_skeeter You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use the quill do you?
harry_potter Oh, no.
rita_skeeter So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve..
harry_potter I'm fourteen.
rita_skeeter ...about to compete against three students. Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?
harry_potter I dunno I haven't really thought about it.
rita_skeeter Course you're not just any ordinary boy of twelve are you...
harry_potter Fourteen.
rita_skeeter The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament.
harry_potter No I didn't enter.
rita_skeeter Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel Harry. Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? proud? or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic deathwish.
harry_potter Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past.
sir#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Harry. I couldn't risk sending Edward. It was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised. We need to talk Harry. Face to face. Meet me in the Griffindore common room at one o clock this Saturday night and make sure you're alone. P.S....
harry_potter AGH!
sir#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 The bird bites.
harry_potter Sirius?
rita_skeeter Harry Potter aged 12, suspect entrant in the tri-wizard tournament. His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his...
harry_potter Sirius?! How...
sir#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?
harry_potter No!
sir#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room?
harry_potter I dunno.
sir#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 You didn't hear a name?
harry_potter No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.
sir#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 What was that?
harry_potter He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?
sir#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more.
harry_potter What are you saying?
sir#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater. And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban.
harry_potter Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
sir#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.
harry_potter I'm not ready for this Sirius.
sir#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 You don't have a choice.
harry_potter Someone's coming!
sir#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Keep your friends close Harry.
ron_weasley Who you talking to?
harry_potter Who says I was talking to anyone.
ron_weasley I heard voices.
harry_potter Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time.
ron_weasley You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.
neville_longbottom Amazing. Amazing.
harry_potter Neville! You're doing it again!
neville_longbottom Oh, right sorry.
harry_potter Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?
neville_longbottom Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.
hermione_granger We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?
hermione_granger Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you.
harry_potter Is that right? Well.... what?
hermione_granger Uhhh...
hermione_granger Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.
harry_potter Well you can tell Ronald...
hermione_granger I'm NOT an owl!
hagrid Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you?
harry_potter Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?
hagrid You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important.
harry_potter What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?
hagrid As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again.
madame_olympe_maxime Hagrid?
hagrid Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on.
hagrid Bonsoir Olympe.
madame_olympe_maxime Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten me.
hagrid Couldn't forget you Olympe.
madame_olympe_maxime What is it you want to show me? When we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated.
hagrid You'll be glad you came. Trust me.
madame_olympe_maxime Ahh, c'est magnifique!
madame_olympe_maxime Can we get closer?
harry_potter Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking.
hagrid Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures.
hagrid Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know.
harry_potter Ron was here?
hagrid Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that?
harry_potter No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.
boy#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Cedric rules!
harry_potter Thanks.
boy#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Like the badge?
harry_potter Excuse me..
harry_potter Can I have a word?
cedric_diggory Alright.
harry_potter Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us.
cedric_diggory Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...?
harry_potter Yes.
cedric_diggory Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear them.
harry_potter Don't worry about it.
harry_potter You're a right foul git you know that?
ron_weasley You think so?
harry_potter I know so.
ron_weasley Anything else?
harry_potter Yeah. Stay away from me.
ron_weasley Fine.
draco_malfoy Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last FIVE.
harry_potter I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic.
alastor_moody I'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned.
professor_mcgonagall Professor Moody what are you doing?
alastor_moody Teaching.
professor_mcgonagall Is that a student?
alastor_moody Technically it's a ferret.
draco_malfoy My father will hear about this!
alastor_moody Is that a threat!
alastor_moody I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair boy! It doesn't end here!
professor_mcgonagall We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that.
alastor_moody He might've mentioned it.
professor_mcgonagall Well you will do well to remember it.
alastor_moody come with me.
alastor_moody That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see the whites of their eyes they're standing right behind me.
alastor_moody Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther. You wouldn't believe it if I did. Now... what are you going to do about your dragon?
harry_potter Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd...
alastor_moody Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come on Potter. What are your strengths?
harry_potter Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer.
alastor_moody Better than fair the way I heard it.
harry_potter But I'm not allowed a broom.
alastor_moody You're allowed a wand.
hermione_granger Pssst! Harry? Is that you?
harry_potter Yeah.
hermione_granger How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...
harry_potter Battle a dragon.
rita_skeeter Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today you might make the front page.
viktor_krum You have no business here. This tent is for champions and friends.
rita_skeeter No matter. We've got what we wanted.
albus_dumbledore Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate.
albus_dumbledore What are you doing here Miss Granger?
hermione_granger Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.
albus_dumbledore Barty. The bag.
barty_crouch Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will...
barty_crouch The welsh green. Mr Krum...
barty_crouch The chinese fireball. Oooooh.
barty_crouch The swedish short-snout. Which leaves...
harry_potter The horntail...
barty_crouch What's that boy?
harry_potter Nothing.
barty_crouch The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions?
albus_dumbledore Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon...
albus_dumbledore Three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant.
hermione_granger Your wand harry! Your wand!
george_weasley We knew you wouldn't die Harry.
fred_weasley Lose a leg.
george_weasley Or an arm.
fred_weasley Pack it in altogether.
twins#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 NEVER!
seamus_finnigan Go on Harry, what's the clue?
harry_potter Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?
harry_potter What the bloody hell was that?
fred_weasley Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in.
ron_weasley I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.
harry_potter Caught on have you. Took you long enough.
ron_weasley Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.
harry_potter Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
ron_weasley At least I warned you about the dragons.
harry_potter Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
ron_weasley Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember?I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out.
harry_potter Who could possibly figure that out?That's completely mental.
ron_weasley Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.
hermione_granger Boys.
hermione_granger Look at this!I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.
nigel Parcel for you Mr Weasley.
ron_weasley Thank you Nigel.
ron_weasley Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.
ron_weasley I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??
harry_potter Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?
ron_weasley Ginny these must be for you.
ginny_weasley I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.
ron_weasley What are you on about?
hermione_granger They're not for Ginny they're for you!Dress robes.
ron_weasley Dress robes? for what?
professor_mcgonagall The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance.
professor_mcgonagall Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.
fred_weasley Try saying that five times faster.
professor_mcgonagall Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight.
ron_weasley Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan.
professor_mcgonagall Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join me.
professor_mcgonagall Now, place your right hand on my waist.
ron_weasley Where?
professor_mcgonagall My waist.
professor_mcgonagall Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...
professor_mcgonagall One two three, one two three, one two three.
harry_potter Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?
twins#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Never.
professor_mcgonagall Everybody come together.
professor_mcgonagall Boys, on your feet.
harry_potter Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...
ron_weasley Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?
harry_potter I think I'd take the dragon right now.
hagrid I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though. You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one hand by the age of six and put him up in the dresser.
hagrid And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own way as it were. But enough of me, what about you!
ron_weasley This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
ron_weasley Well, us and Neville!
harry_potter But then again he can take himself.
hermione_granger It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
ron_weasley Now I'm really depressed.
ron_weasley Well Hermione, you're a girl.
hermione_granger Oh well spotted.
ron_weasley Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.
hermione_granger I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.
ron_weasley Bloody hell.
ron_weasley Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?
harry_potter Agreed.
cho_chang Harry!
harry_potter Cho!
cho_chang Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a bit icey at the top.
harry_potter Ok thanks. Cho?
cho_chang Yes?
harry_potter Um. I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?
cho_chang Sorry? I didn't catch that.
harry_potter Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
cho_chang Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's already asked me. And well I've said I'll go with him.
harry_potter Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.
cho_chang Harry I really am sorry.
harry_potter What happened to you?
girl#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 He just asked Fleur Delacour out.
hermione_granger What?
harry_potter What did she say?
hermione_granger No of course.
hermione_granger She said yes??
harry_potter Don't be silly.
ron_weasley There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out.
girl#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Actually he sort of screamed at her, it was a bit frightening.
harry_potter What did you do then?
ron_weasley What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.
padma_patil Hi Harry.
harry_potter Hey!
ron_weasley Bloody hell.
ron_weasley What are those??
harry_potter My dress robes.
ron_weasley Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar.
harry_potter Well I expect yours are more traditional.
ron_weasley Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.
ron_weasley I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.
harry_potter Leave it alone.
ron_weasley Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out.
harry_potter Who?
ron_weasley Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?
harry_potter Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
ron_weasley Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud.
parvati_patil Hello boys. Don't you look...
parvati_patil ... dashing.
professor_mcgonagall Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
harry_potter Ready professor?
professor_mcgonagall To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that.
harry_potter No.
professor_mcgonagall Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil.
parvati_patil She looks beautiful.
harry_potter Yeah she does.
padma_patil Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum??
ron_weasley No. Absolutely not.
parvati_patil Harry. Take my waist.
harry_potter What?
parvati_patil Now.
hermione_granger Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?
ron_weasley No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.
hermione_granger What's got your wand in a knot?
ron_weasley He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.
hermione_granger The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph?Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends.
ron_weasley Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.
padma_patil Are you going to ask me to dance or not?
ron_weasley No.
ron_weasley He's using you.
hermione_granger How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.
ron_weasley Doubt it. He's way too old.
hermione_granger What? What? That's what you think?
ron_weasley Yeah that is what I think.
hermione_granger You know the solution then don't you.
ron_weasley Go on.
hermione_granger Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort.
ron_weasley Well that's completely off the point. Harry...
hermione_granger Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.
ron_weasley They get scary when they get older.
hermione_granger Ron you spoil everything!
lord_voldemort Let me see it again.
lord_voldemort Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry!At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting!
neville_longbottom You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!
hermione_granger Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.
harry_potter Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
hermione_granger I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?
harry_potter What's that supposed to mean?
hermione_granger I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.
cedric_diggory Hey Potter.
harry_potter Cedric.
cedric_diggory How are you?
harry_potter Spectacular.
cedric_diggory Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
harry_potter Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
cedric_diggory Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?
cedric_diggory It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water.
harry_potter I must be out of my mind.
moaning_myrtle I'd try putting it in the water if I were you.
harry_potter Myrtle!
moaning_myrtle Long time no see.
moaning_myrtle I was circling a blocked drain the other day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice potion. Not being a bad boy again are you Harry?
harry_potter Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?
moaning_myrtle Well. That's what he did. The other boy, the handsome one. Cedric.
moaning_myrtle Well go on, open it.
voice#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the ground. An hour long you'll have to look, to recover what we took.
harry_potter Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?
moaning_myrtle Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles were gone...
hermione_granger Harry, tell me again.
harry_potter Come seek us where our voices sound.
hermione_granger The black lake, that's obvious.
harry_potter An hour long you'll have to look.
hermione_granger Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic
harry_potter Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?
hermione_granger Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.
alastor_moody Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger.
hermione_granger But sir, the second task is only hours away and...
alastor_moody Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!
alastor_moody Why don't you help Potter put his books back.
neville_longbottom You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees?
harry_potter Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great.
neville_longbottom I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed.
harry_potter You're sure about this Neville.
neville_longbottom Absolutely.
harry_potter For an hour.
neville_longbottom Most likely.
harry_potter Most likely?
neville_longbottom Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater.
harry_potter You're telling me this now? You must be joking.
neville_longbottom I just wanted to help.
harry_potter Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?
neville_longbottom You seem a little tense Harry.
harry_potter Do I?
albus_dumbledore Welcome to the second task. Last night something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that they'll be on their own.
alastor_moody Put that in your mouth.
albus_dumbledore You may begin at the start of the cannon.
seamus_finnigan What's the matter with him?
friend#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 I don't know I can't see him.
neville_longbottom Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!
albus_dumbledore The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task.
harry_potter But she's my friend too!
merperson#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Only one.
albus_dumbledore Harry!
barty_crouch Get him another towel.
albus_dumbledore I want all the judges over here now.
fleur_delacour You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My little sister!
fleur_delacour Thank you! And you... . You helped!
ron_weasley Well... yeah... a bit
ron_weasley Merci.
hermione_granger Harry!
harry_potter Hermione
hermione_granger Are you alright? You must be freezing!Personally I think you behaved admirably.
harry_potter I finished last Hermione.
hermione_granger Next to last.
albus_dumbledore Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!
albus_dumbledore For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place!For outstanding moral fibre.
fred_weasley All that moral fibre eh?
ron_weasley Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.
george_weasley Well done 'moral fibre'.
barty_crouch Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter.
alastor_moody Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we? Last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out!
alastor_moody And they say I'm mad.
hagrid So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we all are, four years later.
ron_weasley We're still misfits.
hagrid Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray!
harry_potter Mr Crouch?
albus_dumbledore A man has died here. And he won't be the last, you must take action.
cornelius_fudge I will not. In times like these the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength Dumbledore.
albus_dumbledore Then for once show them some.
cornelius_fudge The tri-wizard tournament will not be cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.
albus_dumbledore But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think.
cornelius_fudge What did you say? What did you say to me?
alastor_moody Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private.
cornelius_fudge Harry! Harry how good to see you again.
harry_potter I can come back later Professor.
albus_dumbledore Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp.
harry_potter Agh!
harry_potter Professor?
man#unknown#HarryPotter.Episode04 Professor.
barty_crouch Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential. Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater. Do you accept these terms?
igor_karkaroff I do sir.
barty_crouch What do you wish to present?
igor_karkaroff I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier.
barty_crouch Mr Rosier is dead.
igor_karkaroff Dead?
alastor_moody Yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't he.
igor_karkaroff I didn't know.
barty_crouch If that is all the witness has to offer...
igor_karkaroff No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy.
barty_crouch Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries.
igor_karkaroff Ya ya, the same. He passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself.
barty_crouch Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be returned to Azkaban.
igor_karkaroff NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, Severus Snape.
albus_dumbledore The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am.
igor_karkaroff It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord.
barty_crouch Silence!
barty_crouch Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded.
igor_karkaroff Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more.
barty_crouch What's that?
igor_karkaroff The name...
barty_crouch Yes?
igor_karkaroff I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and...
barty_crouch The name! Give me the wretched name!
igor_karkaroff Barty Crouch! ... Junior.
barty_crouch_junior Get your hands off me you pathetic little men. Hello father.
barty_crouch You are no son of mine.
barty_crouch_junior GAHHHH!
albus_dumbledore Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.
harry_potter Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?
albus_dumbledore He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask?
harry_potter It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son.
albus_dumbledore Have there been other dreams like this?
harry_potter Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?
albus_dumbledore I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply...
albus_dumbledore Cast them away.
igor_karkaroff It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I.
professor_snape Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?
harry_potter Yes sir.
professor_snape Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden. Nor is this, know what it is?
harry_potter Bubble juice sir?
professor_snape Veritaserum. Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets. The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.
harry_potter I haven't stolen anything.
professor_snape Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing flies? You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm going to find out why.
albus_dumbledore Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory...
albus_dumbledore and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...
albus_dumbledore The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round.
albus_dumbledore In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way.
alastor_moody Champions! Prepare yourselves.
albus_dumbledore On the count of three... ONE...
harry_potter Fleur? Fleur!
cedric_diggory Get down!
harry_potter No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.
cedric_diggory Get off me!
harry_potter He's bewitched!
cedric_diggory Harry! Harry!
cedric_diggory You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me.
harry_potter For a moment so did I.
cedric_diggory Some game huh?
harry_potter Some game.
cedric_diggory Go. Take it, you saved me!
harry_potter Together, on three. One, two, three!
cedric_diggory You ok?
harry_potter Yeah, you?
cedric_diggory Where are we?
harry_potter I've been here before.
cedric_diggory It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey.
harry_potter I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!
cedric_diggory What are you talking about?
cedric_diggory What is it?
harry_potter Get back to the cup!
cedric_diggory Who are you? What do you want?
lord_voldemort Kill the spare.
harry_potter Cedric!
lord_voldemort Do it, now!
wormtail Bones of the father, unwillingly given.
wormtail Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.
wormtail Blood of the enemy forcibly taken.
wormtail The dark lord shall rise again.
lord_voldemort My wand Wormtail.
lord_voldemort Hold out your arm.
wormtail Master. Thank you master.
lord_voldemort The other arm Wormtail.
lord_voldemort Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me.
lord_voldemort Not even you, Lucius.
lucius_malfoy My lord. Had I detected any sign or even a whisper of your whereabouts.
lord_voldemort There were signs my friend, and more than whispers.
lucius_malfoy I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask.
wormtail I returned.
lord_voldemort Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail.
wormtail Thank you master, thank you.
lord_voldemort Oh, such a handsome boy.
harry_potter Don't touch him.
lord_voldemort Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago?Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic, something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I can touch you now!
lord_voldemort Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!
lord_voldemort That's better. And now...
lord_voldemort Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up.
lord_voldemort Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes.
harry_potter Have it your way.
lord_voldemort Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's mine!
harry_potter DAD Harry when the connection is broken you must get to the portkey. We can delay it for a moment to give you time but only a moment, do you understand?
cedric_diggory Harry take my body back will you? Take my body back to my father.
harry_potter MOTHER Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. Let go! Let go!
lord_voldemort No!
albus_dumbledore Harry! Harry!
albus_dumbledore Tell me what happened!
harry_potter He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there.
albus_dumbledore It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are.
cornelius_fudge Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved Dumbledore, there are... too many people.
amos_diggory Let me through! That's my son! My boy!
alastor_moody Are you alright Potter?
alastor_moody Does it hurt?
harry_potter Not so much now.
alastor_moody I'd better take a look at it.
harry_potter The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it.
alastor_moody What was it like? What was he like?
harry_potter Who?
alastor_moody The dark lord. What was it like to stand in his presence?
harry_potter I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.
alastor_moody Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others?
harry_potter Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.
alastor_moody Marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? Do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if I hadn't have told him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom the witless wonder could have provided you with gilliweed if I hadn't have given him the book that led you straight to it? Huh??
harry_potter It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But...
alastor_moody You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter.
albus_dumbledore Severus...
albus_dumbledore Do you know who I am?
alastor_moody Albus Dumbledore.
albus_dumbledore Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?
alastor_moody No.
albus_dumbledore Is he in this room? Is he in this room?
albus_dumbledore Harry get away from there!
albus_dumbledore Are you alright Alastor?
alastor_moody I'm sorry Albus.
harry_potter That's Moody, but then who's...?
professor_snape Polyjuice potion.
albus_dumbledore Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus.
albus_dumbledore We'll get you up in a minute.
albus_dumbledore Barty Crouch Junior.
barty_crouch_junior I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
albus_dumbledore Your arm Harry.
barty_crouch_junior You know what this means don't you?He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.
albus_dumbledore Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.
barty_crouch_junior I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
albus_dumbledore Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes.
albus_dumbledore Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see,
albus_dumbledore I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry.
harry_potter Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
albus_dumbledore Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared.
albus_dumbledore No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone.
viktor_krum Write to me. Promise.
hermione_granger Bye.
fleur_delacour Au revoir Ron.
ron_weasley Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
hermione_granger No.
harry_potter No I don't think so.
hermione_granger Everything's going to change now isn't it?
harry_potter Yes.
hermione_granger Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
ron_weasley Well I won't. You know I won't!
hermione_granger Harry will won't you?
harry_potter Yeah. Every week.

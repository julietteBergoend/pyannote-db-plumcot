eddard_stark Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
barristan_selmy No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
eddard_stark He'd never worn this armor before.
barristan_selmy Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
eddard_stark Who determines the draw?
barristan_selmy All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.
eddard_stark Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters.
barristan_selmy Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
eddard_stark I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.
barristan_selmy You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
eddard_stark My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
barristan_selmy He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.
eddard_stark And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
barristan_selmy Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
eddard_stark Yes. That will never happen.
barristan_selmy Robert tends to do what he wants.
eddard_stark If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.
lancel_lannister It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.
robert_baratheon Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
eddard_stark You're too fat for your armor.
robert_baratheon Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?
robert_baratheon Oh, it’s funny, is it?
lancel_lannister No, Your Grace.
robert_baratheon No? You don't like the Hand's joke?
eddard_stark You're torturing the poor boy.
robert_baratheon You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!
eddard_stark The breastplate stretcher?
robert_baratheon How long before he figures it out?
eddard_stark Maybe you should have one invented.
robert_baratheon All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance.
eddard_stark You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
robert_baratheon Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
eddard_stark And who's going to hit you back?
robert_baratheon Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
eddard_stark There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
robert_baratheon Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
eddard_stark Aye.
robert_baratheon … Drink.
eddard_stark I'm not thirsty.
robert_baratheon Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
eddard_stark Your squire... A Lannister boy?
robert_baratheon Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. "Cersei Lannister will make a good match", he told me. "You'll need her father on your side." I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood.
eddard_stark Robert?
robert_baratheon What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!
eddard_stark Where's Arya
sansa_stark At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.
sansa_stark Thank you, Ser Loras.
sansa_stark Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
eddard_stark Hey.
sansa_stark I can't watch.
petyr_baelish 100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
renly_baratheon I'll take that bet.
petyr_baelish Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
renly_baratheon Or you could even buy a friend.
sansa_stark He's going to die.
eddard_stark Ser Loras rides well.
renly_baratheon Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.
petyr_baelish And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?
petyr_baelish Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really.
sansa_stark Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
petyr_baelish No honor but quite a bit of gold.
robert_baratheon Stop this madness in the name of your King!
loras_tyrell I owe you my life, Ser.
sandor_clegane I'm no Ser.
catelyn_stark Remove his hood.
marillion On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold.
tyrion_lannister This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
catelyn_stark I did... often and loudly.
tyrion_lannister Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?
catelyn_stark And why would I do that?
tyrion_lannister Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
catelyn_stark Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
tyrion_lannister Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?
catelyn_stark Five years ago.
tyrion_lannister She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here.
catelyn_stark I am not a murderer, Lannister.
tyrion_lannister Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
catelyn_stark The dagger found
tyrion_lannister What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
rodrik_cassel Should I gag him?
tyrion_lannister Why? Am I starting to make sense?
rodrik_cassel My Lady, this way.
tyrion_lannister Untie me. If I die, what's the point?
catelyn_stark Rodrik?
rodrik_cassel I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself.
bronn Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
tyrion_lannister Well, I'm willing if she is.
maester_luwin Bran...
bran_stark The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - "We do not sow".
maester_luwin Lords?
bran_stark The Greyjoys.
theon_greyjoy Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.
maester_luwin And failed rebellions.
bran_stark Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.
maester_luwin Good.
bran_stark Words - "Ours is the fury". Lords - the Baratheons.
maester_luwin Mhmm.
bran_stark The Westerlands - sigil - a lion.
maester_luwin Hmm...
bran_stark Words - "A Lannister always pays his debts."
maester_luwin No. A common saying, but not their official motto.
bran_stark Lords - the Lannisters.
maester_luwin We're still on their words.
bran_stark I don't know them.
maester_luwin You do know them. Think.
bran_stark "Unbowed, unbent, unbroken".
maester_luwin That's House Martell.
bran_stark "Righteous in wrath".
maester_luwin House Hornwood.
bran_stark "Family, duty, honor".
maester_luwin Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?
bran_stark "Family, duty, honor"... Is that the right order?
maester_luwin You know it is.
bran_stark Family comes first?
maester_luwin Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
bran_stark How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?
maester_luwin Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
bran_stark And then she left!
maester_luwin When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely.
bran_stark Why did she leave?
maester_luwin I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon.
bran_stark Do you know where she is now? Today?
maester_luwin No, I don't.
bran_stark Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
maester_luwin Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
bran_stark I'll never shoot another arrow.
maester_luwin And where is that written?
bran_stark You need legs to work a bow.
maester_luwin Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.
bran_stark Really?
maester_luwin Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
theon_greyjoy Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
ros I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
theon_greyjoy Important enough for the likes of you.
ros You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.
theon_greyjoy Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
ros Jealous?
theon_greyjoy Why should I be jealous?
theon_greyjoy Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
ros Might surprise you.
theon_greyjoy Hmm?
ros He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
theon_greyjoy Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
ros You are jealous.
theon_greyjoy I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.
ros And what about the Starks?
theon_greyjoy I’ve been Lord Stark’s ward since I was eight years old.
ros A “ward”, that’s a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…
theon_greyjoy My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
ros You’re a very serious boy.
theon_greyjoy I’m not a boy.
ros Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock.
theon_greyjoy I don’t want to pay for it.
ros Then get yourself a wife.
arya_stark Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
lord_varys How is your son, my Lord?
eddard_stark He'll never walk again.
lord_varys But his mind is sound?
eddard_stark So they say.
lord_varys A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
lord_varys If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him.
eddard_stark I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
lord_varys I didn't trust you.
eddard_stark So why do you trust me now?
lord_varys The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.
eddard_stark What sort of doom does the King face?
lord_varys The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.
eddard_stark Who gave it to him?
lord_varys Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.
eddard_stark The squire, Ser Hugh?
lord_varys Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.
eddard_stark If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?
lord_varys Someone who could afford it.
eddard_stark Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?
lord_varys He started asking questions.
lord_varys He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
illyrio_mopatis And when he knows the truth, what will he do?
lord_varys The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend.
illyrio_mopatis What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?
lord_varys This Hand is not the other.
illyrio_mopatis We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
lord_varys "Delay," you say. "Move fast, " I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.
illyrio_mopatis It never was.
lord_varys The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
petyr_baelish You do move quietly.
lord_varys We all have our qualities.
petyr_baelish You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
lord_varys I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
petyr_baelish Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.
lord_varys Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.
petyr_baelish I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important.
lord_varys Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?
petyr_baelish All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
lord_varys And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
petyr_baelish Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.
lord_varys Strictly speaking.
petyr_baelish Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.
lord_varys Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?
petyr_baelish Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
lord_varys Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.
petyr_baelish Saw me with your own eyes?
lord_varys Eyes I own.
petyr_baelish Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
lord_varys Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
petyr_baelish One shudders at the thought.
lord_varys Oh.
petyr_baelish But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
lord_varys Have you?
petyr_baelish Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.
lord_varys Was that you under the bed?
petyr_baelish And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm.
lord_varys Oh, please.
petyr_baelish To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
renly_baratheon What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming.
petyr_baelish To a small council meeting?
lord_varys Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
goldcloak Off with you. No begging.
arya_stark I'm not a beggar. I live here.
goldcloak D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
arya_stark I want to see my father.
goldcloak I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.
goldcloak You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.
arya_stark My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?
eddard_stark You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
arya_stark They said they were going to kill you.
eddard_stark Who did?
arya_stark I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.
eddard_stark Oh, Arya.
arya_stark I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
eddard_stark Where did you hear this?
arya_stark In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.
eddard_stark What were you doing in the dungeons?
arya_stark Chasing a cat.
jory_cassel Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent.
eddard_stark Your name, friend?
yoren Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look.
arya_stark I'm a girl!
eddard_stark Did Benjen send you?
yoren No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.
eddard_stark Ah, we'll find recruits for you.
yoren Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow.
eddard_stark Know what?
yoren Best said in private, my Lord.
eddard_stark Go on. We'll talk more later.
eddard_stark Jory, take her safely to her room.
jory_cassel Come along, my Lady. You heard your father.
arya_stark How many guards does my father have?
jory_cassel Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
arya_stark You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?
jory_cassel No fear on that count, little Lady.
eddard_stark Well?
yoren It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp.
vardis_egen You're far from home, Lady Stark.
catelyn_stark To whom do I speak?
vardis_egen Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
catelyn_stark There was no time to send word.
vardis_egen May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?
catelyn_stark That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
vardis_egen He doesn't look like a prisoner.
catelyn_stark My sister will decide what he looks like.
vardis_egen Yes, my Lady. She will at that.
tyrion_lannister The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
bronn Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
tyrion_lannister I like you.
royal_steward Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.
eddard_stark I need to see the King first -- alone.
royal_steward The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you.
eddard_stark Is it about my wife?
royal_steward No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.
robert_baratheon The whore is pregnant.
eddard_stark You're speaking of murdering a child.
robert_baratheon I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.
eddard_stark You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
robert_baratheon Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!
eddard_stark Then we're no better than the Mad King.
robert_baratheon Careful, Ned. Careful now.
eddard_stark You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
lord_varys No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child.
eddard_stark Based on whose information?
lord_varys Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
eddard_stark Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
petyr_baelish Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.
eddard_stark He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?
robert_baratheon And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
eddard_stark The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
robert_baratheon Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
lord_varys I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.
grand_maester_pycelle I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?
renly_baratheon We should have had them both killed years ago.
petyr_baelish When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.
eddard_stark I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.
robert_baratheon She dies.
eddard_stark I will have no part in it.
robert_baratheon You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will.
eddard_stark And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
robert_baratheon Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!
eddard_stark I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
jory_cassel Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you.
petyr_baelish His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word "treason" was mentioned.
eddard_stark What can I do for you?
petyr_baelish When do you return to Winterfell?
eddard_stark Why? What do you care?
petyr_baelish If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you.
eddard_stark I don't have the time.
petyr_baelish It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
eddard_stark Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
jory_cassel Heward and Wyl.
eddard_stark Find them and meet me at the stables.
lysa_arryn You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, "the seed is strong." He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.
catelyn_stark Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-
lysa_arryn To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
robin_arryn Mommy? Is that the bad man?
lysa_arryn It is.
robin_arryn He's little.
lysa_arryn He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
tyrion_lannister Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
lysa_arryn You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
tyrion_lannister If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.
robin_arryn You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!
lysa_arryn Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby.
robin_arryn Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
lysa_arryn Perhaps you will, my little love.
catelyn_stark This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
lysa_arryn Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord.
mord You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!
loras_tyrell Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
renly_baratheon Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man.
loras_tyrell You're jealous.
renly_baratheon Are you sure this won't hurt?
loras_tyrell Only if I slip.
renly_baratheon And you prefer me like this?
loras_tyrell Mhmm.
renly_baratheon If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.
loras_tyrell I want you.
renly_baratheon My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?
loras_tyrell Hold still.
renly_baratheon All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.
loras_tyrell You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
renly_baratheon His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
loras_tyrell He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
renly_baratheon Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
loras_tyrell It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
renly_baratheon I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.
loras_tyrell Yes well, I guess we'll never know.
renly_baratheon Everywhere?
loras_tyrell Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
renly_baratheon It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.
loras_tyrell It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
renly_baratheon He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.
loras_tyrell I have an outrageous amount of money.
renly_baratheon Not as much as the Lannisters.
loras_tyrell But a lot more than you.
renly_baratheon Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King.
loras_tyrell Hmm... How did that ever happen?
renly_baratheon Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
loras_tyrell Do you know who should be King?
renly_baratheon Be serious.
loras_tyrell I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.
renly_baratheon I'm fourth in line.
loras_tyrell And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
renly_baratheon Stannis?
loras_tyrell Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
renly_baratheon He's still my older brother.
renly_baratheon What are you doing?!
loras_tyrell Look at it.
renly_baratheon You cut me!
loras_tyrell It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you.
loras_tyrell You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King.
cersei_lannister I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
robert_baratheon I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
cersei_lannister Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.
robert_baratheon I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
cersei_lannister No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
robert_baratheon I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them.
cersei_lannister The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
robert_baratheon It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.
cersei_lannister Is my father wrong?
robert_baratheon Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.
cersei_lannister We still outnumber them.
robert_baratheon Which is the bigger number -- five or one?
cersei_lannister Five.
robert_baratheon Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.
cersei_lannister What do you want?
robert_baratheon We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.
cersei_lannister Our marriage.
robert_baratheon Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?
cersei_lannister Every day.
robert_baratheon How long can hate hold a thing together?
cersei_lannister Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.
robert_baratheon Yes, it is.
cersei_lannister Yes, it tis. What was she like?
robert_baratheon You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?
cersei_lannister At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.
robert_baratheon So why now?
cersei_lannister What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
robert_baratheon You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.
cersei_lannister I felt something for you once, you know?
robert_baratheon I know.
cersei_lannister Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?
robert_baratheon No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
cersei_lannister It doesn't make me feel anything.
mhaegen She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair.
eddard_stark Aye.
mhaegen Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is.
eddard_stark I will.
mhaegen And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me.
eddard_stark When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?
mhaegen He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.
eddard_stark She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
petyr_baelish Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink.
eddard_stark What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
petyr_baelish Well, he has more than you, for a start.
eddard_stark How many?
petyr_baelish Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.
eddard_stark And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
petyr_baelish He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
eddard_stark Come.
eddard_stark Jory!
jory_cassel My Lord.
jaime_lannister Such a small pack of wolves.
jory_cassel Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!
jaime_lannister Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
petyr_baelish What's the meaning of this, Lannister?
jaime_lannister Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.
eddard_stark I remember him well.
jaime_lannister It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?
eddard_stark He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
petyr_baelish My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
jaime_lannister Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.
jory_cassel If you threaten my Lord again...
jaime_lannister Threaten? As in, "I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?
eddard_stark You kill me, your brother's a dead man.
jaime_lannister You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
jaime_lannister My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back.

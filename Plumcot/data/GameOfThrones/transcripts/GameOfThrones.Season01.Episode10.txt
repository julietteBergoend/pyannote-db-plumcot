arya_stark l'm not a boy !
yoren You're not a smart boy , is that what you're trying to say ?
yoren Do you want to live , boy? !
yoren North , boy , we're going north .
bran_stark lt had three eyes .
bran_stark lt told me to come with him , so l did .
bran_stark We went down into the crypts and my father was there .
osha Your father's not down there , little lord .
osha Not for many years yet .
bran_stark You're afraid .
bran_stark Just like Hodor .
osha l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground .
bran_stark You've lived beyond the Wall .
bran_stark What are you scared of ?
bran_stark l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go .
bran_stark That's my grandfather , Lord Rickard .
bran_stark He was burned alive by the Mad King , Aerys .
bran_stark That's Lyanna , my father's sister .
bran_stark King Robert was supposed to marry her , but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her .
bran_stark Robert started a war to win her back .
bran_stark He killed Rhaegar , but she died anyway .
bran_stark That's where l saw Father .
osha You see ?
osha He's not here .
rickon_stark Here , Shaggydog .
bran_stark Rickon !
osha That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels !
rickon_stark He doesn't like chains .
bran_stark What are you doing down here ?
bran_stark Come back up with us .
rickon_stark No , l came to see Father .
bran_stark How many times have l told you ?
bran_stark He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya .
rickon_stark He was down here .
rickon_stark l saw him .
bran_stark Saw him when ?
rickon_stark Last night , when l was sleeping .
rickon_stark Here , Shaggydog .
osha You both miss him .
osha lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams , but that doesn't mean that -
maester_luwin Bran ...

marillion Your Grace ?
joffrey_baratheon Fingers or your tongue ?
joffrey_baratheon lf you got to keep one , which would it be ?
joffrey_baratheon Or l could just cut your throat .
marillion Every man needs hands , Your Grace .
joffrey_baratheon Good .
joffrey_baratheon Tongue it is .
marillion Your Grace , please .
marillion l won't sing , Your Grace .

marillion Your Grace , please !
joffrey_baratheon You look quite nice .
sansa_stark Thank you , my lord .

joffrey_baratheon Walk with me .
joffrey_baratheon l want to show you something .
sandor_clegane Do as you're bid , child .

joffrey_baratheon Mother says that shouldn't be long .
sansa_stark No !

joffrey_baratheon This one's your father .
joffrey_baratheon This one here .
joffrey_baratheon Look at it and see what happens to traitors .
sansa_stark You promised to be merciful .
joffrey_baratheon l was .
joffrey_baratheon l gave him a clean death .
joffrey_baratheon Look at him .
sansa_stark Please let me go home .
sansa_stark l won't do any treason , l swear -
joffrey_baratheon Mother says l'm still to marry you .

joffrey_baratheon Ser Meryn.
sandor_clegane Here , girl .
joffrey_baratheon Will you obey now ?
joffrey_baratheon Or do you need another lesson ?
joffrey_baratheon l'll look for you in court .
sandor_clegane Save yourself some pain , girl .
sandor_clegane Give him what he wants .
sandor_clegane You'll be needing that again .
jonos_bracken The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his .
robb_stark Renly is not the king .
jonos_bracken You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey , my lord .
jonos_bracken He put your father to death .
robb_stark That doesn't make Renly king .
robb_stark He's Robert's youngest brother .
robb_stark lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me , Renly can't be king before Stannis .
jonos_bracken Do you mean to declare us for Stannis ?
lord_galbart_glover Renly is not right !
lord_galbart_glover lf we put ourselves behind Stannis ...
greatjon_umber My Lords .
greatjon_umber My Lords !
greatjon_umber Here is what l say to these two kings .
greatjon_umber Renly Baratheon is nothing to me , nor Stannis neither .
greatjon_umber Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South ?
greatjon_umber What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood ?
greatjon_umber Even their gods are wrong !
greatjon_umber Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again ?
greatjon_umber lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead !
greatjon_umber There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North !
rickard_karstark l'll have peace on those terms .
rickard_karstark They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too .
rickard_karstark The King in the North !
theon_greyjoy Am l your brother , now and always ?
robb_stark Now and always .
theon_greyjoy My sword is yours in victory and defeat , from this day until my last day .
greatjon_umber The King in the North !
all@ The King in the North !
all@ The King in the North !
all@ The King in the North !
all@ The King in the North !
all@ The King in the North !
all@ The King in the North !

stark_guard Lady Stark .
catelyn_stark l want to see him .
catelyn_stark Now !
catelyn_stark Leave us .
catelyn_stark Leave us .
jaime_lannister You look lovely tonight , Lady Stark .
jaime_lannister Widowhood becomes you .
jaime_lannister Oh , l do like a violent woman .
catelyn_stark l will kill you tonight , Ser .
catelyn_stark Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister .
jaime_lannister Let me show you how .
jaime_lannister Hit me again , over the ear .
jaime_lannister And again and again .
jaime_lannister You're stronger than you look , it shouldn't take long .
catelyn_stark That is what you want the world to believe , isn't it ?
catelyn_stark That you don't fear death .
jaime_lannister But l don't , my lady .
jaime_lannister The dark is coming for all of us .
jaime_lannister Why cry about it ?
catelyn_stark Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells , if the gods are just .
jaime_lannister What gods are those ?
jaime_lannister The trees your husband prayed to ?
jaime_lannister Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off ?
jaime_lannister lf
jaime_lannister your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice ?
catelyn_stark Because of men like you .
jaime_lannister There are no men like me .
jaime_lannister Only me .
catelyn_stark My son Bran .
catelyn_stark How did he come to fall from that tower ?
jaime_lannister l pushed him out the window .
catelyn_stark Why ?
jaime_lannister I hoped the fall would kill him .
catelyn_stark Why ?
jaime_lannister You should get some sleep .
jaime_lannister lt's going to be a long war .
lancel_lannister l can't believe we're actually at war .
lancel_lannister Was it this exciting last time , when you were young ?
lancel_lannister What does it say ?
lancel_lannister Have we captured Robb Stark yet ?
lancel_lannister What's our next move ?
cersei_lannister Stop talking .
cersei_lannister Get back into bed .
tywin_lannister They have my son .
tyrion_lannister The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped .
leo_lefford l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses .
addam_marbrand ls it true about Stannis and Renly ?
kevan_lannister Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us .
kevan_lannister Jaime captured , his armies scattered .
kevan_lannister lt's a catastrophe .
kevan_lannister Perhaps we should sue for peace .
tyrion_lannister There's your peace .
tyrion_lannister Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head .
tyrion_lannister You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now .
tyrion_lannister He's winning - in
tyrion_lannister case you hadn't noticed .
kevan_lannister l'm told we still have his sisters .
leo_lefford The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime .
addam_marbrand First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise -
tywin_lannister Not you .
tywin_lannister You were right about Eddard Stark .
tywin_lannister lf
tywin_lannister he were alive , we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun , which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers .
tywin_lannister But now - madness .
tywin_lannister Madness and stupidity .
tywin_lannister l always thought you were a stunted fool .
tywin_lannister Perhaps l was wrong .
tyrion_lannister Half wrong .
tyrion_lannister l'm new to strategy , but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies , it appears we can't stay here .
tywin_lannister No one will stay here .
tywin_lannister Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork .
tywin_lannister The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal .
tywin_lannister And you will go to King's Landing .
tyrion_lannister And do what ?
tywin_lannister Rule .
tywin_lannister You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead .
tywin_lannister You will bring that boy king to heel , and his mother too , if needs be .
tywin_lannister And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest - Baelish , Varys , Pycelle ...
tyrion_lannister Heads , spikes , walls .
tyrion_lannister Why not my uncle ?
tyrion_lannister Why not anyone ?
tyrion_lannister Why me ?
tywin_lannister You're my son .
tywin_lannister Oh , one more thing .
tywin_lannister You will not take that whore to court .
tywin_lannister Do you understand ?
daenerys_targaryen Ser Jorah ?
jorah_mormont Gently , gently .
daenerys_targaryen My son - where is he ?
daenerys_targaryen l want him .
daenerys_targaryen Where is he ?
jorah_mormont The boy did not live .
daenerys_targaryen Tell me .
jorah_mormont What is there to tell ?
daenerys_targaryen How did my son die ?
jorah_mormont He never lived , my princess .
jorah_mormont The women say -
daenerys_targaryen What do the women say ?
jorah_mormont They say the child was -
mirri_maz_duur Monstrous , twisted .
mirri_maz_duur l pulled him out myself .
mirri_maz_duur He was scaled like a lizard , blind , with leather wings like the wings of a bat .
mirri_maz_duur When l touched him the skin fell from his bones .
mirri_maz_duur Inside he was full of graveworms .
mirri_maz_duur l warned you that only death can pay for life .
mirri_maz_duur You knew the price .
daenerys_targaryen Where is Khal Drogo ?
daenerys_targaryen Show him to me .
daenerys_targaryen Show me what l bought with my son's life .
mirri_maz_duur As you command , lady .
mirri_maz_duur Come .
mirri_maz_duur l will take you to him .
jorah_mormont Time enough for that later -
daenerys_targaryen l want to see him now .
daenerys_targaryen The khalasar is gone .
jorah_mormont A khal who cannot ride is no khal .
jorah_mormont The Dothraki follow only the strong .
jorah_mormont l'm sorry , my Princess .
daenerys_targaryen Drogo !
daenerys_targaryen Why is he out here alone ?
jorah_mormont He seems to like the warmth , Princess .
mirri_maz_duur He lives .
mirri_maz_duur You asked for life , you paid for life .
daenerys_targaryen This is not life .
daenerys_targaryen When will he be as he was ?
mirri_maz_duur When the sun rises in the west , sets in the east .
mirri_maz_duur When the seas go dry .
mirri_maz_duur When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves .
daenerys_targaryen Leave us .
jorah_mormont l don't want you alone with this sorceress .
daenerys_targaryen l have nothing more to fear from this woman .
daenerys_targaryen Go .
daenerys_targaryen You knew what l was buying
daenerys_targaryen and you knew the price .
mirri_maz_duur lt was wrong of them to burn my temple .
mirri_maz_duur lt angered the Great Shepherd .
daenerys_targaryen This is not God's work .
daenerys_targaryen My child was innocent .
mirri_maz_duur lnnocent ?
mirri_maz_duur He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World .
mirri_maz_duur Now he will burn no cities .
mirri_maz_duur Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust .
daenerys_targaryen l spoke for you .
daenerys_targaryen l saved you .
mirri_maz_duur Saved me ?
mirri_maz_duur Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me , girl .
mirri_maz_duur l saw my god's house burn , there where l had healed men and women beyond counting .
mirri_maz_duur ln
mirri_maz_duur the streets l saw piles of heads , the head of the baker who makes my bread , the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past .
mirri_maz_duur So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved ?
daenerys_targaryen Your life .
mirri_maz_duur Why don't you take a look at your khal .
mirri_maz_duur Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone .
samwell_tarly You can't !
jon_snow Get out of my way , Sam .
samwell_tarly They'll put out the word .
samwell_tarly They'll send out ravens .
samwell_tarly People will come after you .
samwell_tarly Do you know what happens to deserters ?
jon_snow Better than you do .
samwell_tarly What are you going to do ?

samwell_tarly No .
jon_snow Hyah !
shae Hand of the King ?
tyrion_lannister So it would seem .
shae And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing ?
tyrion_lannister No , he said l couldn't take you with me to King's Landing .
tyrion_lannister He was very specific on that point .
shae He knew my name ?
tyrion_lannister What ?
shae He said , " Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing " ?
tyrion_lannister l believe he used the word " whore " .
shae Are you ashamed of me ?
shae Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out ?
shae I'm funny now ?
shae l'm Shae , the funny whore .
tyrion_lannister My father's probably the most powerful man in the country .
tyrion_lannister Certainly the richest .
tyrion_lannister He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets .
tyrion_lannister Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says .
tyrion_lannister He's always been a cunt .
tyrion_lannister l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you .
tyrion_lannister Why don't you come with me , be the Hand's lady ?
tyrion_lannister Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand -
shae l know what a Hand needs .

daenerys_targaryen Then you shall return to me , my sun and stars .
grand_maester_pycelle Kings ?
grand_maester_pycelle Oh , l can tell you all there is to know about kings .
grand_maester_pycelle The thing you need to understand about kings is -
grand_maester_pycelle For the past 67 years , l've known truly known more kings than any man alive .
grand_maester_pycelle They're complicated men , but l know how to serve them .
grand_maester_pycelle Yes , and keep on serving them .
grand_maester_pycelle Aerys Targaryen .
grand_maester_pycelle Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us , madness is the worst .
grand_maester_pycelle He was a good man .
grand_maester_pycelle Such a charmer .
grand_maester_pycelle To watch him melt away before my eyes , consumed by dreams of fire and blood .
grand_maester_pycelle Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal - powerful man , great warrior , but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things .
grand_maester_pycelle They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down , he can often be blind to the enemies at his side .
grand_maester_pycelle Now l serve his son King Joffrey , may the Gods bless his reign .
grand_maester_pycelle He is a capable young man .
grand_maester_pycelle Strong military mind .
grand_maester_pycelle Stern .
grand_maester_pycelle But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice .
grand_maester_pycelle lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be , but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King .
grand_maester_pycelle Mmm .
grand_maester_pycelle True greatness .
ros So what's the thing ?
grand_maester_pycelle What thing ?
ros About kings .
ros You said , " The thing you need to understand about kings " .
grand_maester_pycelle What ?
grand_maester_pycelle Things ?
grand_maester_pycelle What ?
ros When you started , you ... Never mind .
grand_maester_pycelle Let me see you out , my dear .
ros lt's all right .
ros No need .
grand_maester_pycelle Yes , yes .
grand_maester_pycelle Till the next time .
grand_maester_pycelle Right .
lord_varys When you imagine yourself up there , how do you look ?
lord_varys Does the crown fit ?
lord_varys Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow , the ones who sneered at you for years ?
petyr_baelish lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads .
lord_varys A man with great ambition and no morals ...
lord_varys l wouldn't bet against you .
petyr_baelish And what would you do , my friend , if you found yourself sitting up there ?
lord_varys l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King .
petyr_baelish You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man .
lord_varys Oh , you can do better than that .
petyr_baelish When they castrated you , did they take the pillar with the stones ?
petyr_baelish l've always wondered .
lord_varys Have you ?
lord_varys Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs ?
petyr_baelish l picture a gash .
petyr_baelish Like a woman's .
petyr_baelish ls that about right ?
lord_varys l am flattered , of course , to be pictured at all .
petyr_baelish Must be strange for you , even after all these years ... a man from another land , despised by most , feared by all .
lord_varys Am l ?
lord_varys That is good to know .
lord_varys Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash ?
petyr_baelish But you carry on whispering in one king's ear
petyr_baelish and then the next .
petyr_baelish l admire you .
lord_varys And l admire you , Lord Baelish .
lord_varys A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men - and women .
petyr_baelish A useful talent , l'm sure you'd agree .
lord_varys So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect .
petyr_baelish Playing our roles .
lord_varys Serving a new King .
petyr_baelish Long may he reign .
petyr_baelish My king .
lord_varys My king .
joffrey_baratheon My lords .
joffrey_baratheon Shall we begin ?
yoren You're Arry now , hear me ?

hizdahr_zo_loraq I am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man.
daenerys_targaryen "Barristan the Bold" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.
daario_naharis We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide.
daenerys_targaryen I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
hizdahr_zo_loraq But... I'm the leader of my family.
hizdahr_zo_loraq No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!
daenerys_targaryen Walk forward.
winter_town_man You cannot do this.
daenerys_targaryen Another step.
daenerys_targaryen . But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must.
daenerys_targaryen But she does not give up on them.
daenerys_targaryen , I should let the dragons decide.
hizdahr_zo_loraq All men must die.
daenerys_targaryen Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.
samwell_tarly "And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure." She sounds like quite a woman.
maester_aemon And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying.
samwell_tarly Don't say that, Maester Aemon.
maester_aemon A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing.
jon_snow Maester Aemon.
maester_aemon Lord Commander.
jon_snow Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.
jon_snow How are you feeling?
maester_aemon Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death.
jon_snow I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.
maester_aemon Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it.
jon_snow But you don't know what it is.
maester_aemon That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born.
jon_snow Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Who leads them?
tormund_giantsbane They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.
jon_snow What about you?
tormund_giantsbane Hard to lead when you're in chains.
jon_snow What if I unchained you?
tormund_giantsbane Why would you do that?
jon_snow Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
tormund_giantsbane You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
jon_snow For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you.
tormund_giantsbane And now everything is going to change?
jon_snow It is.
tormund_giantsbane Why now?
jon_snow Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
tormund_giantsbane What would you have me do, , Lord Commander?
jon_snow . I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
tormund_giantsbane They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
jon_snow I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
tormund_giantsbane The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
jon_snow And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward.
tormund_giantsbane . Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
jon_snow Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
tormund_giantsbane Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?
jon_snow Up on Storrold's Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
tormund_giantsbane We'll need ships.
jon_snow I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
tormund_giantsbane All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won’t be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode05 You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?
jon_snow Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.
man_1#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode05 Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us.
stannis_baratheon Fewer.
davos_seaworth What?
stannis_baratheon Nothing.
samwell_tarly . Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.
man_2#unknown#GameOfThrones.Season05.Episode05 And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.
alliser_thorne We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.
jon_snow And we've slaughtered theirs.
eddison_tollett I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. . They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it.
jon_snow You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that.
jon_snow Thank you. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right.
olly You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them.
jon_snow It's not a trick.
olly They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.
jon_snow I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
olly Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?
jon_snow No.
podrick_payne She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
brienne_of_tarth . Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.
brienne_of_tarth Thank you. You've lived here a long time?
winter_town_man Aye.
brienne_of_tarth Did you know Lord Eddard?
winter_town_man I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.
brienne_of_tarth Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.
winter_town_man Everyone knows. The Boltons.
brienne_of_tarth I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.
winter_town_man Who are you?
brienne_of_tarth Someone who swore to keep her safe.
winter_town_man Swore to who?
brienne_of_tarth Her mother.
winter_town_man Her mother's dead.
brienne_of_tarth That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?
ramsay_bolton Come back here. Myranda.
myranda I saw you staring at her.
ramsay_bolton I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.
myranda You said you'd marry me.
ramsay_bolton And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.
myranda Do you think she's pretty?
ramsay_bolton Of course I do. I'm not blind.
ramsay_bolton You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you.
myranda Perhaps I'll marry, too.
ramsay_bolton . You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?
myranda . Never.
old_woman Beg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin.
sansa_stark Oh, I don't need-
old_woman . You still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower.
sansa_stark But who -
old_woman You're not alone.
myranda I like your dress. Who made it for you?
sansa_stark I made it myself.
myranda Really?
sansa_stark Who, who are you?
myranda I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? . Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?
sansa_stark My mother. .
myranda I'm sorry for what happened to her.
sansa_stark Thank you.
myranda It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her.
sansa_stark I'd rather have a mother.
myranda I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember.
myranda Down there at the end.
sansa_stark What is it?
myranda That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it.
sansa_stark Theon?
theon_greyjoy You shouldn't be here.
ramsay_bolton You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.
ramsay_bolton Do you have something to tell me?
theon_greyjoy No, my lord.
ramsay_bolton Reek.
theon_greyjoy . She saw me.
ramsay_bolton Who?
theon_greyjoy Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.
ramsay_bolton She saw you?
theon_greyjoy Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -
ramsay_bolton Come here.
ramsay_bolton You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees.
ramsay_bolton Give me your hand.
ramsay_bolton I forgive you.
roose_bolton I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady.
sansa_stark Yes, thank you, my lord.
ramsay_bolton Allow me.
ramsay_bolton Mother.
walda_bolton Thank you, Ramsay.
ramsay_bolton My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth.
roose_bolton . To your wedding.
walda_bolton . To your wedding.
walda_bolton It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.
sansa_stark This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
ramsay_bolton You're right. Very strange. More wine, please.
ramsay_bolton I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. . I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?
theon_greyjoy . Yes, master.
ramsay_bolton That's his new name, Reek.
sansa_stark Why are you doing this?
ramsay_bolton Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? . An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers.
theon_greyjoy . I'm sorry.
ramsay_bolton Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye.
theon_greyjoy I'm sorry.
ramsay_bolton Sorry about what?
theon_greyjoy For killing your brothers.
ramsay_bolton There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. . You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?
roose_bolton Yes, yes, very good.
ramsay_bolton Wonderful. .
roose_bolton Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together.
walda_bolton We're going to have a baby.
sansa_stark I'm very happy for you.
roose_bolton From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.
ramsay_bolton How can you be sure?
roose_bolton Sure of what?
ramsay_bolton That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?
roose_bolton Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.
ramsay_bolton So how did you manage it?
roose_bolton Manage what?
ramsay_bolton Getting her pregnant.
roose_bolton I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.
ramsay_bolton Of course, but how did you find it?
roose_bolton You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl.
ramsay_bolton And if it's a boy?
roose_bolton You're worried about your position.
ramsay_bolton My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.
roose_bolton You've never asked me about your mother.
ramsay_bolton Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are.
roose_bolton She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. . Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?
ramsay_bolton Yes.
gilly Is this every book there is?
samwell_tarly Every book there is?
gilly In the world.
samwell_tarly Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually.
gilly Where you grew up, were there more books?
samwell_tarly My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
gilly Where's that?
samwell_tarly The Citadel? In Oldtown.
gilly I'm sorry I don't know things.
samwell_tarly Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound.
gilly I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.
samwell_tarly Well -
gilly Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?
samwell_tarly It's where they train the maesters.
gilly Like Maester Aemon?
samwell_tarly I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you.
samwell_tarly Ah, Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon You're Samwell Tarly?
samwell_tarly I am, Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker.
samwell_tarly I did, Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon How?
samwell_tarly With a dagger made of dragonglass.
stannis_baratheon Dragonglass?
samwell_tarly What the maesters call obsidian -
stannis_baratheon I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
samwell_tarly I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.
stannis_baratheon The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
samwell_tarly I've seen it, Your Grace.
stannis_baratheon Seen what?
samwell_tarly The army of the dead. And when they come -
stannis_baratheon We have to know how to fight them. . Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.
stannis_baratheon It's time.
davos_seaworth Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.
stannis_baratheon If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise.
davos_seaworth I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
stannis_baratheon No need, they're coming with us.
davos_seaworth It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -
stannis_baratheon Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us.
davos_seaworth As you wish, Your Grace.
shireen_baratheon . Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?
davos_seaworth Beg your pardon?
shireen_baratheon At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-
davos_seaworth First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.
shireen_baratheon Is there going to be a battle?
davos_seaworth Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -
selyse_baratheon That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child.
davos_seaworth Yes, my queen.
shireen_baratheon I'm not scared.
davos_seaworth Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me.
shireen_baratheon . I promise.
stannis_baratheon I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.
jon_snow You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you.
missandei You're still too weak. .
grey_worm How long have I been here?
missandei Three days.
grey_worm Ser Barristan?
grey_worm I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen.
missandei Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known.
grey_worm This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid.
missandei All men fear death.
grey_worm No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath.
missandei Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.
daenerys_targaryen If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?
missandei Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters.
daenerys_targaryen . You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?
missandei I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. . I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see.
hizdahr_zo_loraq My, my queen, please do not do this.
daenerys_targaryen What about "Valar Morghulis"?
hizdahr_zo_loraq I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. .
daenerys_targaryen It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live.
hizdahr_zo_loraq Yes, my queen.
daenerys_targaryen And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. . Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.
tyrion_lannister Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.
jorah_mormont We are.
tyrion_lannister What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
jorah_mormont No wine.
tyrion_lannister I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…
tyrion_lannister I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.
jorah_mormont I am.
tyrion_lannister Have you sailed this route before?
jorah_mormont No.
tyrion_lannister You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
jorah_mormont I think you'll be plenty.
tyrion_lannister You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
jorah_mormont No. But the pirates are.
tyrion_lannister Oh.
tyrion_lannister The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -
jorah_mormont And then they weren't.
tyrion_lannister And then they weren't. "They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"
jorah_mormont "The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned."
tyrion_lannister I would clap.
tyrion_lannister I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains.
tyrion_lannister What was that?
jorah_mormont Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!
jorah_mormont Get behind!
tyrion_lannister Mormont, cut me free! . Mormont!
tyrion_lannister Mormont! Mormont!
jorah_mormont . Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.
jorah_mormont You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
tyrion_lannister . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.
jorah_mormont I suppose that's why they send them there.
tyrion_lannister It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . So what now?
jorah_mormont We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat.
tyrion_lannister Without luck?
jorah_mormont We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?
tyrion_lannister That's the best idea you've had all day.

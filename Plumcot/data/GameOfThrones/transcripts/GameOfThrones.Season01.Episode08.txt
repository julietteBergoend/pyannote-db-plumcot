arya_stark Only 'cause you lied .
syrio_forel My tongue lied .
syrio_forel My eyes shouted the truth .
syrio_forel You were not seeing .
arya_stark I was so .
arya_stark I watched , but
arya_stark you ...
syrio_forel Watching is not seeing , dead girl .
syrio_forel The seeing , the true seeing , that is the heart of swordplay .
meryn_trant Arya Stark , come with us .
meryn_trant Your father wants to see you .
syrio_forel And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own ?
syrio_forel I am wondering .
meryn_trant Mind your place , dancing master .
meryn_trant This is no concern of yours .
arya_stark My father wouldn't send you .
arya_stark And I don't have to go with you if I don't want .
meryn_trant Take her .
syrio_forel Are you men or snakes , that you would threaten a child ?

lord_varys Lord Stark , you must be thirsty .
eddard_stark Varys .
lord_varys I promise you it isn't poisoned .
lord_varys Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch ?
lord_varys Not so much , My Lord .
lord_varys I would save the rest , if I were you .
lord_varys Hide it .
lord_varys Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells .
eddard_stark What about my daughters ?
lord_varys The younger one seems to have escaped the castle .
lord_varys Even my little birds cannot find her .
eddard_stark And Sansa ?
lord_varys Still engaged to Joffrey .
lord_varys Cersei will keep her close .
lord_varys The rest of your household though , all dead , it grieves me to say .
lord_varys I do so hate the sight of blood .
eddard_stark You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing .
lord_varys And would again , My Lord .
lord_varys I was unarmed , unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords .
lord_varys When you look at me do you see a hero ?
lord_varys What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey's birth ?
eddard_stark The madness of mercy .
eddard_stark That she might save her children .
lord_varys Ah , the children .
lord_varys It is always the innocents who suffer .
lord_varys It wasn't the wine that killed Robert , nor the boar .
lord_varys The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open , but it was your mercy that killed the King .
lord_varys I trust you know you are a dead man , Lord Eddard ?
eddard_stark The Queen can't kill me .
eddard_stark Cat holds her brother .
lord_varys The wrong brother sadly .
lord_varys And lost to her .
lord_varys Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers .
eddard_stark If that's true , then slit my throat and be done with it .
lord_varys Not today , My Lord .
eddard_stark Tell me something , Varys .
eddard_stark Who do you truly serve ?
lord_varys The Realm , My Lord .
lord_varys Someone must .
jeor_mormont It's Othor , without a doubt .
othell_yarwyck The other one is Jafer Flowers , My Lord , less the hand the wolf tore off .
jeor_mormont Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party ?
jon_snow Just these two , My Lord .
jon_snow Been dead awhile , I'd say .
jeor_mormont Mmm .
samwell_tarly The smell .
othell_yarwyck What smell ?
samwell_tarly There is none .
samwell_tarly If they'd be dead for a long time , wouldn't there be rot ?
jon_snow We should burn them .
othell_yarwyck Snow's not wrong , My Lord .
othell_yarwyck Fire will do for them .
othell_yarwyck The Wildling way .
jeor_mormont I want Maester Aemon to examine them first .
jeor_mormont You may be a coward , Tarly , but you're not stupid .
jeor_mormont Get them inside .
othell_yarwyck You heard him .
alliser_thorne Lord Commander , Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers .
alliser_thorne A raven from King's Landing .
nights_watch_officer Come on , move 'em out .
jeor_mormont Bring me a horn of ale , Snow , and pour one for yourself .
jeor_mormont The King is dead .
jon_snow Is there any word of my father ?
jeor_mormont Sit .
jeor_mormont Lord Stark has been charged with treason .
jeor_mormont They say he conspired with Robert's brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey .
jeor_mormont I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid .
jeor_mormont Your duty lies here now .
jon_snow My sisters were in King's Landing too .
jeor_mormont I'm sure they'll be treated gently .
lord_varys Your father has proved to be an awful traitor , dear .
grand_maester_pycelle King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne .
sansa_stark He wouldn't do that .
sansa_stark He knows how much I love Joffrey .
sansa_stark He wouldn't .
sansa_stark Please , Your Grace , there's been a mistake .
sansa_stark Send for my father .
sansa_stark He'll tell you , the King was his friend .
cersei_lannister Sansa sweetling , you are innocent of any wrong .
cersei_lannister We know that .
cersei_lannister Yet you are the daughter of a traitor .
cersei_lannister How can I allow you to marry my son ?
grand_maester_pycelle A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King .
grand_maester_pycelle She is a sweet thing now , Your Grace , but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch ?
sansa_stark No , I'm not .
sansa_stark I'll be a good wife to him , you'll see .
sansa_stark I'll be a Queen just like you , I promise .
sansa_stark I won't hatch anything .
petyr_baelish The girl is innocent , Your Grace .
petyr_baelish She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty .
cersei_lannister Little dove , you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother , the eldest .
cersei_lannister What's his name ?
sansa_stark Robb .
cersei_lannister Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon , no doubt .
cersei_lannister Best it comes from you .
cersei_lannister If you would help your father , urge your brother to keep the King's peace .
cersei_lannister Tell him to come to King's Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey .
sansa_stark If ...if I could see my father , talk to him about ...
cersei_lannister You disappoint me , child .
cersei_lannister We have told you of your father's treason .
cersei_lannister Why would you want to speak to a traitor ?
sansa_stark I only meant that ...what will happen to him ?
cersei_lannister That depends .
sansa_stark On ...on what ?
cersei_lannister On your brother .
cersei_lannister And on you .
robb_stark Treason ?
robb_stark Sansa wrote this ?
maester_luwin It is your sister's hand , but the Queen's words .
maester_luwin You are summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to the new King .
robb_stark Joffrey puts my father in chains , now he wants his ass kissed ?
maester_luwin This is a royal command , My Lord .
maester_luwin If you should refuse to obey ...
robb_stark I won't refuse .
robb_stark His Grace summons me to King's Landing , I'll go to King's Landing .
robb_stark But not alone .
robb_stark Call the banners .
maester_luwin All of them , My Lord ?
robb_stark They've all sworn to defend my father , have they not ?
maester_luwin They have .
maester_luwin Now we see what their words are worth .
maester_luwin Yeah .
theon_greyjoy Are you afraid ?
robb_stark I must be .
theon_greyjoy Good .
robb_stark Why is that good ?
theon_greyjoy It means you're not stupid .
catelyn_stark You've had this since dawn ?
lysa_arryn He sent it to me , not you .
lysa_arryn I've only shown it to you as a courtesy .
catelyn_stark A courtesy? !
catelyn_stark My husband has been taken prisoner .
catelyn_stark My son intends to declare war .
lysa_arryn A war ?
lysa_arryn Your son against the Lannisters ?
lysa_arryn You should go to him .
lysa_arryn Teach him patience .
catelyn_stark Ned rots in a dungeon
catelyn_stark and you speak of patience ?
catelyn_stark He is your brother by law!Does family mean nothing to you ?
lysa_arryn Family means everything to me .
lysa_arryn And I will not risk Robin's life to get caught up in another of your husband's wars .
robin_arryn I'm hungry .
lysa_arryn Hush now , darling .
lysa_arryn You just ate .
catelyn_stark You will not support us then ?
catelyn_stark Do I understand you correctly ?
robin_arryn But I'm hungry !
lysa_arryn Soon , love , soon .
lysa_arryn You're always welcome here , sister .
lysa_arryn But if you're asking me to send men from the Vale to fight ...
catelyn_stark That is what I ask .
lysa_arryn Go on , sweet .
lysa_arryn Time for your bath .
lysa_arryn I'll feed you after .
catelyn_stark If you fear for the safety of your son ...
lysa_arryn Of course I fear for the safety of my son !
lysa_arryn Are you an idiot ?
lysa_arryn They killed my husband .
lysa_arryn You say they shoved your boy from a window .
lysa_arryn These people will do anything .
catelyn_stark And that is why we have to stop them .
lysa_arryn The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong , to protect their Lord .

bronn There's hill tribes all around here .
tyrion_lannister If I'm going to die , it may as well be with a song in my heart .
bronn I should just take your food and leave you here .
bronn Eh ?

bronn Fair enough .
bronn But don't go looking for me to bend the knee and " My Lord "
bronn you every time you take a shit .
bronn I'm not your toady
bronn and I'm not your friend .
tyrion_lannister Though I would treasure your friendship .

tyrion_lannister Half a man maybe , but at least I have the courage to face my enemies .
tyrion_lannister What do the Stone Crows do ?
tyrion_lannister Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by ?
tyrion_lannister Are those the best weapons you could steal ?
tyrion_lannister Good enough for killing sheep , if the sheep don't fight back .
tyrion_lannister Lannister smiths shit better steel .
shagga You think you can win us over with your trinkets ?
tyrion_lannister That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns .

tyrion_lannister I will give you this .
shagga What is " this " ?
tyrion_lannister The Vale of Arryn .

khal_drogo This is the way of war .
khal_drogo These women are slaves now to do with as we please .
daenerys_targaryen It pleases me to keep them safe .
daenerys_targaryen If your riders would mount them , let them take them for wifes .

greatjon_umber For 30 years I've been making corpses out of men , boy .
greatjon_umber I'm the man you want leading the Vanguard .
robb_stark Galbart Glover will lead the Van .
greatjon_umber The bloody Wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover .
greatjon_umber I will lead the Van or I will take my men and march them home .
robb_stark You are welcome to do so , Lord Umber .
robb_stark And when I am done with the Lannisters , I will march back North , root you out of your Keep and hang you for an oathbreaker .
greatjon_umber Oathbreaker , is it? !
greatjon_umber I'll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass .
robb_stark My Lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your Liege Lord .
robb_stark But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me .
greatjon_umber Your meat ...is bloody tough .
bran_stark What is it ?
bran_stark What's happened ?
robb_stark Shh , it's all right .
bran_stark Where are you going ?
robb_stark South .
robb_stark For father .
bran_stark But it's the middle of the night .
robb_stark The Lannisters have spies everywhere .
robb_stark I don't want them to know we're coming .
bran_stark They have more men than we do .
robb_stark Aye , they do .
bran_stark Can't I come with you ?
bran_stark I can ride now .
bran_stark You've seen me riding .
bran_stark And I won't get in the way ,
bran_stark I ...
robb_stark There must always be a Stark at Winterfell .
robb_stark Until I return that will be you .
robb_stark You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone .
robb_stark Do you understand ?
robb_stark Listen to Maester Luwin .
robb_stark Look after your little brother .
bran_stark I will .
robb_stark I'll send letters whenever I can , but if you don't hear from me , don't be scared .
robb_stark Until I return .
bran_stark How long have you been hiding out there ?
bran_stark Robb will be looking for you , to say goodbye .

bran_stark And Theon too , I suppose .
osha You hear them , boy ?
osha The Old Gods are answering you .
bran_stark What are you doing here ?
osha They're my Gods too .
osha Beyond the Wall , they're the only Gods .
osha Even slaves are allowed to pray .
bran_stark You're not a slave .
bran_stark Well , your friend did put a knife to my throat .
osha I'm not complaining , Little Lord , just telling truths .
bran_stark What did you mean about hearing the Gods ?
osha You asked them , they're answering you .
osha Shh .
osha Open your ears .
bran_stark It's only the wind .
bran_stark Who do you think sends the wind if not the Gods ?
bran_stark They see you , boy .
bran_stark They hear you .
bran_stark Your brother will get no help from them where he's going .
bran_stark The Old Gods have no power in the South .
bran_stark The Weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago .
bran_stark How can they watch when they have no eyes ?
osha Well , there's a big man .
osha He has giants blood in him
osha or I'm the Queen .
bran_stark Go back and find your clothes , Hodor .
bran_stark Go dress .
hodor Hodor .
bran_stark Are there really giants beyond the Wall ?
osha Giants and worse than giants .
osha I tried telling your brother , he's marching the wrong way.
osha All these swords , they should be going North , boy .
osha North , not south !
osha The cold winds are rising .
samwell_tarly They were touched by White Walkers .
samwell_tarly That's why they came back .
samwell_tarly That's why their eyes turned blue .
samwell_tarly Only fire will stop them .
jon_snow How do you know that ?
samwell_tarly I read about it in a book .
samwell_tarly A very old book in Maester Aemon's library .
jon_snow What else did the book say ?
samwell_tarly The White Walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years .
samwell_tarly And when they wake up ...
pypar And when they wake up , what ?
samwell_tarly I hope The Wall is high enough .
rodrik_cassel Summer snows , My Lady .
catelyn_stark Robb's brought the North with him .
robb_stark The River Lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels .
robb_stark And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South .
robb_stark Our scouts confirm it's even larger than the Kingslayer's .
greatjon_umber One army or two , the Kings in the North threw back hosts ten times this large .
robb_stark Mother !
catelyn_stark You look well .
greatjon_umber Lady Catelyn , you're a welcome sight in these troubled times .
theon_greyjoy We had not thought to meet you here , My Lady .
catelyn_stark I had not thought to be here .
catelyn_stark I would speak with my son alone .
catelyn_stark I know you will forgive me , My Lords .
greatjon_umber You heard her !
greatjon_umber Move your asses !
greatjon_umber Come on , out .
greatjon_umber You too , Greyjoy .
greatjon_umber Are you bloody deaf ?
greatjon_umber Have no fear , My Lady .
greatjon_umber We'll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister's bunghole
greatjon_umber and then it's on to the Red Keep to free Ned .
greatjon_umber You old devil , Rodrik .
rodrik_cassel Jon .
greatjon_umber You're not wasting away , are you ?
catelyn_stark I remember the day you came into this world red-faced and squalling .
catelyn_stark And now I find you leading a host to war .
robb_stark There was no one else .
catelyn_stark No one ?
catelyn_stark Who were those men I saw here ?
robb_stark None of them are Starks .
catelyn_stark All of them are seasoned in battle .
robb_stark If you think you can send me back to Winterfell ...
catelyn_stark Oh , would that I could .
robb_stark There was a letter .
robb_stark From Sansa .
catelyn_stark From the Queen , you mean .
catelyn_stark There's no mention of Arya .
robb_stark No .
catelyn_stark How many men do you have ?
robb_stark 18,000 .
robb_stark If I go to King's Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey ...
catelyn_stark you would never be allowed to leave .
catelyn_stark No .
catelyn_stark Our best hope , our only hope , is that you can defeat them in the field .
robb_stark And if I lose ?
catelyn_stark Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children , when the Mad King fell ?
robb_stark They were butchered in their sleep .
catelyn_stark On the orders of Tywin Lannister .
catelyn_stark And the years have not made him kinder .
catelyn_stark If you lose , your father dies , your sisters die , we die .
robb_stark Well , that makes it simple then .
catelyn_stark I suppose it does .
tyrion_lannister From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone .
shagga Best for Tyrion son of Tywin .
shagga Not best for me .
shagga If the half man betrays us , Shagga son of Dolf will cut off his manhood ...
tyrion_lannister And feed it to the goats , yes .
tyrion_lannister All right then .
tyrion_lannister Time to meet my father .
kevan_lannister Tyrion .

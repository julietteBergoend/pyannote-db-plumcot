jaime_lannister " Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane , the Mountain " Uh , " arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown . " Poor Ned Stark .
jaime_lannister Brave man , terrible judgment .
tywin_lannister Attacking him was stupid .
tywin_lannister Lannisters don't act like fools .
tywin_lannister Are you gonna say something clever ?
tywin_lannister Go on , say something clever .
jaime_lannister Catelyn Stark took my brother .
tywin_lannister Why is he still alive ?
jaime_lannister Tyrion ?
tywin_lannister Ned Stark .
jaime_lannister One of our men interfered , speared him through the leg before I could finish him .
tywin_lannister Why is he still alive ?
jaime_lannister It wouldn't have been clean .
tywin_lannister Clean ...
tywin_lannister You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you .
jaime_lannister I could care less what anyone thinks of me .
tywin_lannister Now that's what you want people to think of you .
jaime_lannister It's the truth .
tywin_lannister When you hear them whispering " Kingslayer " behind your back , doesn't it bother you ?
jaime_lannister Of course it bothers me .
tywin_lannister The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep .
tywin_lannister I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness .
tywin_lannister I'm giving you half of our forces .
tywin_lannister 30,000 men .
tywin_lannister You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts .
jaime_lannister I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life .
tywin_lannister He's a Lannister .
tywin_lannister He might be the lowest of the Lannisters , but he's one of us .
tywin_lannister And every day that he remains a prisoner , the less our name commands respect .
jaime_lannister So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of. .
tywin_lannister No , it's not an opinion , it's a fact !
tywin_lannister If another House can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity , we are no longer a House to be feared .
tywin_lannister Your mother's dead .
tywin_lannister Before long I'll be dead .
tywin_lannister And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children .
tywin_lannister All of us dead , all of us rotting in the ground .
tywin_lannister It's the family name that lives on .
tywin_lannister It's all that lives on .
tywin_lannister Not your personal glory , not your honor , but family .
tywin_lannister Do you understand ?
tywin_lannister Hmm .
tywin_lannister You're blessed with abilities that few men possess .
tywin_lannister You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms .
tywin_lannister And you are still blessed with youth .
tywin_lannister And what have you done with these blessings , huh ?
tywin_lannister You've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings .
tywin_lannister One a madman , the other a drunk .
tywin_lannister The future of our family will be determined in these next few months .
tywin_lannister We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years .
tywin_lannister Or we could collapse into nothing , as the Targaryens did .
tywin_lannister I need you to become a man you were always meant to be .
tywin_lannister Not next year .
tywin_lannister Not tomorrow .
tywin_lannister Now .
cersei_lannister You're in pain .
eddard_stark I've had worse , my lady .
cersei_lannister Perhaps it's time to go home .
eddard_stark The South doesn't seem to agree with you .
eddard_stark I know the truth Jon Arryn died for .
cersei_lannister Do you , Lord Stark ?
cersei_lannister Is that why you called me here , to pose me riddles ?
eddard_stark Has he done this before ?
cersei_lannister Jaime would have killed him .
cersei_lannister My brother is worth a thousand of your friend .
eddard_stark Your brother Or your lover ?
cersei_lannister The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure .
cersei_lannister Jaime and I are more than brother and sister .
cersei_lannister We shared a womb .
cersei_lannister We came into this world together .
cersei_lannister We belong together .
eddard_stark My son saw you with him .
cersei_lannister Do you love your children ?
eddard_stark With all my heart .
cersei_lannister No more than I love mine .
eddard_stark And they are all Jaime's .
cersei_lannister Thank the Gods .
cersei_lannister In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed , I finish him off in other ways .
cersei_lannister In the morning , he doesn't remember .
eddard_stark You've always hated him .
cersei_lannister Hated him ?
cersei_lannister I worshiped him .
cersei_lannister Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him , but he was mine by oath .
cersei_lannister And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor , lean and fierce and black-bearded , it was the happiest moment of my life .
cersei_lannister Then that night he crawled on top of me , stinking of wine and did what he did , what little he could do , and whispered in my ear , " Lyanna " .
cersei_lannister Your sister was a corpse
cersei_lannister and I was a living girl
cersei_lannister and he loved her more than me .
eddard_stark When the King returns from his hunt , I'll tell him the truth .
eddard_stark You must be gone by then .
eddard_stark You and your children .
eddard_stark I will not have their blood on my hands .
eddard_stark Go as far away as you can , with as many men as you can .
eddard_stark Because wherever you go , Robert's wrath will follow you .
cersei_lannister And what of my wrath , Lord Stark ?
cersei_lannister You should have taken the realm for yourself .
cersei_lannister Jaime told me about the day King's Landing fell .
cersei_lannister He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up .
cersei_lannister All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself .
cersei_lannister Such a sad mistake .
eddard_stark I've made many mistakes in my life , but that wasn't one of them .
cersei_lannister Oh , but it was .
cersei_lannister When you play the Game of Thrones , you win or you die .
cersei_lannister There is no middle ground .
ros Come here .
ros Oh yes , oh .
ros Oh yes yes yes .
petyr_baelish No no
petyr_baelish no no !
petyr_baelish Is that what they teach you up in the North ?
petyr_baelish And you--
petyr_baelish wherever you're from , do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound ?
petyr_baelish Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying ?
ros Yes , My Lord .
petyr_baelish Let's start over , shall we ?
petyr_baelish You be the man and you be the woman .
petyr_baelish Well , go ahead .
petyr_baelish Slowly .
petyr_baelish You're not fooling them .
petyr_baelish They just paid you .
petyr_baelish They know what you are .
petyr_baelish They know it's all just an act .
petyr_baelish Your job is to make them forget what they know .
petyr_baelish That takes time .
petyr_baelish You need to Ease into it .
petyr_baelish Go ahead .
petyr_baelish Ease into it .
petyr_baelish He's winning you over in spite of yourself .
petyr_baelish You're starting to like this .
petyr_baelish He wants to believe you .
petyr_baelish He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it .
petyr_baelish Why shouldn't you ?
petyr_baelish He knows he's better than other men .
petyr_baelish He's always known it deep down inside .
petyr_baelish Now he has proof .
petyr_baelish He's so good
petyr_baelish , he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there .
petyr_baelish Overcoming your very nature .
ros Why don't you join us , My Lord ?
petyr_baelish I'm saving myself for another .
ros What she doesn't know won't hurt her .
petyr_baelish What we don't know is usually what gets us killed .
ros She must be very beautiful .
petyr_baelish No , not really .
petyr_baelish Impeccable bloodlines though .
ros I do believe my lord's in love .
petyr_baelish For many years .
petyr_baelish Most of my life really .
petyr_baelish Play with her ass .
petyr_baelish And she loved me too .
petyr_baelish I was her little confidant ,
petyr_baelish her plaything .
petyr_baelish She could tell me anything , anything at all .
petyr_baelish She told me about all the horses that she liked .
petyr_baelish The castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry .
petyr_baelish A northerner with a jaw like an anvil .
petyr_baelish So I challenged him to a duel .
petyr_baelish I mean , why not ?
petyr_baelish I'd read all the stories .
petyr_baelish The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories .
petyr_baelish In the end , she wouldn't even let him kill me . "
petyr_baelish He's just a boy " , she said .
petyr_baelish " Please don't hurt him " .
petyr_baelish So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by , and off they went .
ros Is she still married to him ?
petyr_baelish Oh no .
petyr_baelish He got himself killed before the wedding .
petyr_baelish And she ended up with his brother , an even more impressive specimen .
petyr_baelish She loves him , I'm afraid .
petyr_baelish And why wouldn't she ?
petyr_baelish I mean , who could compare to him ?
petyr_baelish He's just so ...good .
petyr_baelish Do you know what I learned , losing that duel ?
petyr_baelish I learned that I'll never win .
petyr_baelish Not that way .
petyr_baelish That's their game , their rules .
petyr_baelish I'm not going to fight them .
petyr_baelish I'm going to fuck them .
petyr_baelish That's what I know .
petyr_baelish That's what I am .
petyr_baelish And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want .
ros And what do you want ?
petyr_baelish Now wash yourselves .
petyr_baelish Both of you are working tonight .
petyr_baelish Hmm .
theon_greyjoy You're a very lucky girl .
theon_greyjoy Do you know that ?
theon_greyjoy Where I come from , we don't show mercy to criminals .
theon_greyjoy Where I come from , if someone like you attacked a little lord , at low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach , your hands and feet chained to four stakes .
theon_greyjoy The sea would come in closer and closer .
theon_greyjoy You'd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time .
osha Where is it you come from ?
theon_greyjoy The Iron Islands .
osha They far away ?
theon_greyjoy You've never heard of the Iron Islands ?
osha Trust me , you've never heard where I'm from neither .
theon_greyjoy Trust me , My Lord .
theon_greyjoy You're not living in the wilderness anymore .
theon_greyjoy In civilized lands , you refer to your betters by their proper titles .
osha And what's that ?
theon_greyjoy Lord .
osha Why ?
theon_greyjoy Why ?
theon_greyjoy What do you mean why ?
theon_greyjoy My father is Balon Greyjoy , Lord of the Iron Islands .
osha What's that got to do with you ?
osha If your father's lord , how can you be lord too ?
theon_greyjoy I will be lord after my father .
osha So you're not lord now ?
theon_greyjoy No , you ...You having a go at me ?
theon_greyjoy Is that it ?
osha I just don't understand how you Southerners do things .
theon_greyjoy I'm not a Southerner .
osha You're from South of the wall .
osha That makes you a Southerner to me .
theon_greyjoy You're an impudent little wench , aren't you ?
osha Couldn't say , My Lord .
osha Don't know what " impunent " means .
theon_greyjoy Impudent .
theon_greyjoy It means rude .
theon_greyjoy Disrespectful .
maester_luwin Theon Greyjoy !
maester_luwin The lady is our guest .
theon_greyjoy I thought she was our prisoner .
maester_luwin Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience ?
maester_luwin Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens .
osha I'm used to worse than him .
osha I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones .
maester_luwin Why did you come here ?
osha Didn't mean to come here .
osha Meant to get much further South than this .
osha As far South as South goes , before the long night comes .
maester_luwin Why ?
maester_luwin What are you afraid of ?
osha There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night .
maester_luwin Owls and Shadowcats
maester_luwin and ...
osha I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats .
maester_luwin The " things " you speak of-- they've been gone for thousands of years .
osha They wasn't gone , old man .
osha They was sleeping .
osha And they ain't sleeping no more .

barristan_selmy He commanded us to step aside , but I failed him .
eddard_stark No man could have protected him from himself .
lord_varys I wonder , Ser Barristan , who gave the king this wine ?
barristan_selmy His squire , from the king's own skin .
eddard_stark His squire ?
eddard_stark The Lannister boy ?
lord_varys Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment .
lord_varys I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself .
eddard_stark His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen .
eddard_stark Whatever arrangements you made , unmake them .
eddard_stark At once .
lord_varys I'm afraid those birds have flown .
lord_varys The girl is likely dead already .
khal_drogo The stallion who mounts the world , has no need for iron chairs .
daenerys_targaryen According to the prophecy , the stallions will ride to the ends of the world .
khal_drogo The earth ends at the black salt sea .
khal_drogo No horse can cross the poison water .
daenerys_targaryen The earth does not end at the sea , there are many dirts beyond the sea .
daenerys_targaryen The dirt where I was born .
khal_drogo Not dirt .

daenerys_targaryen Throne
khal_drogo Throne ?
daenerys_targaryen A chair for a King to sit upon , or a Queen .

khal_drogo He only needs a horse .
daenerys_targaryen Can't you help me make him understand ?

jorah_mormont We will go home , I promise you .
daenerys_targaryen My brother was a fool , I know ,
daenerys_targaryen but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms .
daenerys_targaryen Have I said something funny , Ser ?
jorah_mormont Forgive me , Khaleesi , but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror
jorah_mormont didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right .
jorah_mormont He had no right to them .
jorah_mormont He seized them because he could .
daenerys_targaryen And because he had dragons .
jorah_mormont Ah well , having a few dragons makes things easier .
daenerys_targaryen You don't believe it .
jorah_mormont Have you ever seen a dragon , Khaleesi ?
jorah_mormont I believe what my eyes and ears report .
jorah_mormont As for the rest It was 300 years ago .
jorah_mormont Who knows what really happened ?
jorah_mormont Now if you'll pardon me , I'll seek out the merchant Captain , see if he has any letters for me .

wine_merchant The wine is for the Khaleesi .
wine_merchant It's not for the likes of you .
jorah_mormont Open it .
jorah_mormont Pour .
wine_merchant It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe .
daenerys_targaryen Do as he says .
wine_merchant As the princess commands .
wine_merchant Sweet , isn't it ?
wine_merchant Can you smell the fruit , Ser ?
wine_merchant Taste it , My Lord .
wine_merchant Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue .
jorah_mormont You first .
wine_merchant Me ?
wine_merchant I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage .
wine_merchant Besides , it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares .
daenerys_targaryen You will drink .
doreah Khaleesi !
doreah Stop him !

pypar I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver .
pypar So now I'm here .
pypar At the end of the world with no one to sing for , but old men and little shits like you .
pypar I'll never see my family again .
pypar I'll never be inside a woman again .
pypar So don't tell me about fair .
samwell_tarly I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister ?
pypar You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock ?
samwell_tarly Could you sing me a song , Pyp ?
samwell_tarly I'd like to hear a song .
samwell_tarly Now listen to me .
samwell_tarly The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch .
samwell_tarly You'll be with him day and night .
samwell_tarly Yes , you'll clean his clothes.
samwell_tarly But you'll also take his letters , attend him at meetings , squire for him in battle .
samwell_tarly You'll know everything , be part of everything .
samwell_tarly And he asked for you himself .
samwell_tarly He wants to groom you for command .
jon_snow I just , I always wanted to be a Ranger .
samwell_tarly I always wanted to be a Wizard .
samwell_tarly What ?
samwell_tarly No , I'm serious .
samwell_tarly So you'll stay and say your words with me ?
renly_baratheon Lord Stark , a moment .
renly_baratheon Alone if you will .
renly_baratheon He named you Protector of the Realm .
renly_baratheon He did .
renly_baratheon She won't care .
renly_baratheon Give me an hour
renly_baratheon and I can put a hundred swords at your command .
eddard_stark And what should I do with a hundred swords ?
renly_baratheon Strike !
renly_baratheon Tonight while the castle sleeps .
renly_baratheon We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody .
renly_baratheon Protector of the Realm or no , he who holds the King holds the Kingdom .
renly_baratheon Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare .
renly_baratheon By the time Robert dies , it will be too late for the both of us .
eddard_stark What about Stannis ?
renly_baratheon Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis ?
renly_baratheon You have odd notions about protecting the realm .
eddard_stark Stannis is your older brother .
renly_baratheon This isn't about the bloody line of succession .
renly_baratheon That didn't matter when you rebelled against the Mad King .
renly_baratheon It shouldn't matter now .
renly_baratheon What's best for the Kingdoms ?
renly_baratheon What's best for the people we rule ?
renly_baratheon We all know what Stannis is .
renly_baratheon He inspires no love or loyalty .
renly_baratheon He's not a King .
renly_baratheon I am .
eddard_stark Stannis is a commander .
eddard_stark He's led men into war twice .
eddard_stark He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet .
renly_baratheon Yes , he's a good soldier .
renly_baratheon Everyone knows that .
renly_baratheon So was Robert.
renly_baratheon Tell me something
renly_baratheon Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings ?
eddard_stark I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds .
eddard_stark You will sail to dragonstone tonight .
eddard_stark You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon .
eddard_stark Not his steward , not his Captain of the guard , and not his wife .
eddard_stark Only Stannis himself .
tomard Yes , My Lord .
eddard_stark Now leave us .
petyr_baelish My Lord protector .
eddard_stark The King has no true born sons .
eddard_stark Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister's bastards .
petyr_baelish So when the King dies ...
eddard_stark The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis .
petyr_baelish So it would seem .
petyr_baelish Unless ...
eddard_stark There is no " unless " .
eddard_stark He is the rightful heir .
eddard_stark Nothing can change that .
petyr_baelishAnd he cannot take the throne without your help .
petyr_baelishAnd You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds .
eddard_stark Do you have a shred of honor ?
petyr_baelish You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm .
petyr_baelish All of the power is yours .
petyr_baelish You need only reach out and take it .
petyr_baelish Make peace with the Lannisters .
petyr_baelish Release the Imp .
petyr_baelish Wed your daughter to Joffrey .
petyr_baelish We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis .
petyr_baelish And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne , we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead .
eddard_stark We ?
petyr_baelish You'll need someone to share these burdens .
petyr_baelish I assure you , my price would be modest .
eddard_stark What you suggest is treason .
petyr_baelish Only if we lose .
eddard_stark Make peace with the Lannisters , you say .
eddard_stark With the people who tried to murder my boy .
petyr_baelish We only make peace with our enemies , my Lord .
petyr_baelish That's why it's called " making peace " .
eddard_stark No .
eddard_stark I won't do it .
petyr_baelish So it will be Stannis and war ?
eddard_stark There is no other choice .
eddard_stark He is the heir .
petyr_baelish So why did you call me here ?
petyr_baelish Not for my wisdom , clearly .
eddard_stark You promised Catelyn you would help me .
eddard_stark The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms .
eddard_stark Enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard .
eddard_stark I need the gold cloaks .
eddard_stark The City Watch is 2,000 strong and sworn to defend the King's peace .
petyr_baelish Look at you .
petyr_baelish You know what you want me to do .
petyr_baelish You know it has to be done , but it's not honorable so the words stick in your throat .
petyr_baelish When the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another , whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect ?
petyr_baelish Who do they follow ?
petyr_baelish The man who pays them .

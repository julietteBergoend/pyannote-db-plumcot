jesse_pinkman Here's my résumé .
jesse_pinkman I mean , technically it says " curriculum vitae, " which I think is more professional ,
jesse_pinkman but , you know , same thing pretty much .
arroyo_realty_manager Great .
arroyo_realty_manager But this position truly is a noexperiencenecessary kind of thing .
arroyo_realty_manager Well
jesse_pinkman Well , and it doesn't really say it here , but I have a solid background in sales .
jesse_pinkman I'm pretty much a selfstarter , so .
arroyo_realty_manager That's excellent , but Excellent
jesse_pinkman Excellent .
jesse_pinkman I really feel I could be a major , major asset to your sales force .
arroyo_realty_manager thinking there's a little misunderstanding .
arroyo_realty_manager This isn't actually a sales job .
arroyo_realty_manager I mean , I'd be happy to consider you for a sales position , but our agents need to be licensed , have at least two years onthejob experience , and usually a college degree .
arroyo_realty_manager What you would be doing is more like advertising .

walter_white_jr. All the stuff I've been through , and you're scared of a little chemotherapy ?
marie_schrader Me , personally ?
marie_schrader I think you should do whatever you want to do .
skyler_white What ?
marie_schrader You told us to be honest about our feelings .
marie_schrader Walt's the one with cancer .
marie_schrader It's his decision .
marie_schrader It's not up to any of us .
skyler_white Why in the hell would you do this ?
marie_schrader I wasn't planning on agreeing with Walt .
marie_schrader But after sitting here and listening to you all talk about his future like he has no say in it .
skyler_white He's not gonna have a future if he doesn't get treatment .
marie_schrader I am a medical professional .
marie_schrader I xray people in treatment every day .
marie_schrader I see them every day , and you know what ?
marie_schrader Some of them are absolutely miserable .
skyler_white Marie
marie_schrader I'm sorry , but it's true .
marie_schrader And some of them don't wanna spend their last weeks or months being picked at by doctors .
marie_schrader But they got talked into it by their families .
hank_schrader Could I get the pillow back ?
hank_schrader I agree with Marie on
marie_schrader on that .
skyler_white What
hank_schrader What ?
hank_schrader Maybe Maybe Walt wants to die like a man .
skyler_white That's the whole point of this .
skyler_white So either help , or leave !
marie_schrader Skyler , I just wanted to do you the courtesy of giving you my honest opinion .
skyler_white You know , Marie , this is not debate club .
skyler_white This is my husband's life .
marie_schrader make one simple observation My husband's life
marie_schrader we're talking
skyler_white Come on .
skyler_white How dare you
walter_white_jr. This is so stupid .
walter_white All right , I've got the Talking Pillow now .
walter_white We all , in this room , we love each other .
walter_white We want what's best for each other , and I know that .
walter_white I am very thankful for that .
walter_white But what I want What I want , what I need , is a choice .
skyler_white What does that mean ?
walter_white Sometimes , I feel like I never actually make any of my own .
walter_white Choices , I mean .
walter_white My entire life , it just seems I never you know , had a real say about any of it .
walter_white Now this last one , cancer all I have left is how I choose to approach this .
skyler_white Then make the right choice , Walt .
skyler_white You're not the only one it affects .
skyler_white What about your son ?
skyler_white Don't you wanna
skyler_white see your daughter grow up ?
skyler_white I just
walter_white Of course , I do .
walter_white Skyler , you've read the statistics .
walter_white These doctors talking about surviving .
walter_white One year , two years , like it's the only thing that matters .
walter_white But what good is it , to just survive if I am too sick to work , to enjoy a meal , to make love ?
walter_white For what time I have left , I want to live in my own house .
walter_white I want to sleep in my own bed .
walter_white I don't wanna choke down 30 or 40 pills every single day , lose my hair , and lie around , too tired to get up and so nauseated that I can't even move my head .
walter_white cleaning up after me ?
walter_white Me , some dead man , some artificially alive , just marking time ?
walter_white No .
walter_white And that's how you would remember me .
walter_white That's the worst part .
walter_white So that is my thought process , Skyler .
walter_white sorry .
walter_white I just I choose not to do it .
skyler_white right what
walter_white I'll do the treatment .
walter_white It's gonna be okay .
skyler_white The lady from the billing office said they usually bill the insurance company directly , but since our HMO is not paying for it , we can pay up front with a credit card .
skyler_white And then Elliott will send a check .
walter_white I will take care of it .
medical_technician Walter White ?
walter_white Yes .
walter_white Okay .
skyler_white See you in a
walter_white a minute Elliott .
gretchen_schwartz Walt , it's Gretchen .
walter_white Oh , hey .

walter_white How are you ?
walter_white You know , it was really great seeing you two the other day
walter_white What a party .

gretchen_schwartz We wanted you to know that .
walter_white Yeah , well , thank you .
walter_white Walt , Elliott's told me he had offered to pay for the treatment .
walter_white You have
gretchen_schwartz That That money , as far as we're both concerned , that belongs to you .

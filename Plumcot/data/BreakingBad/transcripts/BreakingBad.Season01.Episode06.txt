walter_wite Let's get something straight.
walter_wite This, the chemistry, is my realm.
walter_wite I am in charge of the cooking.
walter_wite Out there on the street, you deal with that.
walter_wite As far as our customers go, I don't wanna know anything about them.
walter_wite I don't want to see them. I don't want to hear from them
walter_wite I want no interaction with them whatsoever.
walter_wite This operation is you and me, and I'm the silent partner.
walter_wite You got any issues with that?
jesse_pinkman Whatever, man.
walter_wite No matter what happens, no more bloodshed.
walter_wite Nothin'" Walt? You all
skyler_white right? Oh
walter_wite Oh, yeah. Yeah.
walter_wite I'm okay.
walter_wite You know, honey, you really don't have to
skyler_white I like being here with you.
walter_wite I'm
walter_wite I'm only saying that, I'd be okay with it, really, if you want to go.
walter_wite You know, actually, it would make me feel a little better knowing that you were there when Walter Jr. gets home from school.
skyler_white Okay
skyler_white Okay. All right. You'll call me when you're finished?
skyler_white And have you been in touch with Elliott? Because
skyler_white Because I haven't seen a check from him.
walter_wite Yes, I got it.
skyler_white Really?
walter_wite It came, yeah.
walter_wite Yeah
walter_wite it came last week, and I put it right into my credit union account,
walter_wite so Taken care of it
skyler_white Good.
walter_wite So we're good.
walter_wite We're good.
walter_wite Could you not deposit this until Monday?
clinic's_clerk#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode06 Call if the discomfort's too much. Otherwise, we'll see you next week.
walter_wite matter and energy.
walter_wite When a reaction is gradual, the change in energy is slight. I
walter_wite I mean, you don't even notice the reaction is happening.
walter_wite For example, when rust collects on the underside of a car.
walter_wite But if a reaction happens quickly, otherwise harmless substances can interact in a way that generates enormous bursts of energy.
walter_wite Who can give me an example of rapid chemical reaction?
walter_wite hint.
walter_wite Right here
student_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode06 Like an explosion?
walter_wite Yes. Good.
walter_wite Explosions.
walter_wite Explosions are the result of chemical reactions happening almost instantaneously.
walter_wite And the faster reactants, i. e., explosives,
walter_wite and fulminative mercury is a prime example of that,
walter_wite faster they undergo change, the more violent the explosion.
walter_wite explosions.
walter_wite Okay, listen. Why don't you start reading on your own from the top of chapter 7,
hugo_archuleta okay?
hugo_archuleta I got it, Mr. White. Don't worry.
hugo_archuleta kids to teach.
walter_wite Thanks, Hugo.
skyler_white He's starting to lose weight, which is tough to see that.
skyler_white You know, to feel the difference when I put my arms around him.
mrs_pope Of course
skyler_white Walt when you don't let me in, when you don't tell me what's going on, I think it's like I feel like you don't even want me around sometimes.
skyler_white And recently these afternoons, when you're coming home so late and we're just left wondering where you are.
walter_white_jr Yeah, Dad.
walter_white_jr What's up with that?
mrs_pope Walt, is there anything else you're holding back from your family?
mrs_pope Now's the time to share.
walter_wite Well I like to be alone, I mean at times,
walter_wite and it's not about you, really.
walter_wite It's just that sometimes it feels better not to talk at all about anything, to anyone.
mrs_pope Alone time can be helpful for some types.
mrs_pope Maybe knowing what you do when you're alone might make it easier for your family to be more accepting of whatever it is you do alone.
walter_wite Well I like to go on walks a couple of times a week, maybe more, after work
walter_wite And I really enjoy the nature.
walter_wite You know, the cacti, the vegetation, that kind of thing.
walter_wite It's really very therapeutic.
jesse_pinkman Yo! You okay?
walter_wite Did you breathe that shit?
walter_wite No.
walter_wite just dizzy.
walter_wite Come here.
jesse_pinkman Sit
walter_wite Sit down, sit down
jesse_pinkman off. Sit down. Get some air.
jesse_pinkman that's better. When were you going to tell me?
walter_wite Tell you what?
jesse_pinkman Cancer.
jesse_pinkman You got it, right?
walter_wite How did you know?
jesse_pinkman My aunt had one of those dots on her, to target the radiation.
jesse_pinkman What is it, in your lung?
jesse_pinkman I'm your partner, man. You should have told me.
jesse_pinkman That's not cool, okay?
jesse_pinkman Not at all.
jesse_pinkman What stage are you?
jesse_pinkman to your lymph nodes.
walter_wite Your aunt. How bad was she when they caught it
jesse_pinkman Bad enough. She didn't last long.
walter_wite How long?
jesse_pinkman Seven months.
jesse_pinkman I get it now.
jesse_pinkman That's why you're doing all this.
jesse_pinkman You want to make some cash for your people before you check out.
walter_wite You got a problem with that?
jesse_pinkman You tell me.
jesse_pinkman You're the one that looks like you just crawled out of a microwave.
jesse_pinkman You going to be able to finish the batch?
walter_wite Yes.
walter_wite You do it.
jesse_pinkman Me?
walter_wite Yeah.
walter_wite What happened to your mad skills?
walter_wite Go on.
walter_wite Here
walter_wite You do it.
walter_wite You can do it.
walter_wite If you have any questions, I'll be right out here.
jesse_pinkman next time, put an ice pack on your head during chemo.
jesse_pinkman My aunt said it helped with the hair loss.
hank_schrader This
hank_schrader the one we found way out in the boonies, the cook
hank_schrader site? Holy shit.
steven_gomez What
hank_schrader What? Lab pulled up an imprint of some old writing that used to be on the inside. Old Magic Marker or something.
steven_gomez Yeah? What's
steven_gomez What's it say?
hank_schrader Property of J. P. Wynne Chemistry Lab.
hank_schrader That's Walt's school.
walter_wite We were supposed to start at 3.
jesse_pinkman I'm out there making fat stacks, man. Chill
jesse_pinkman Chill. Hey.
jesse_pinkman Prepaid cell phone.
jesse_pinkman Use it.
walter_wite How much is this?
jesse_pinkman 26 big ones.
walter_wite that all?
walter_white No
jesse_pinkman No, that's 26 hundred, and your share is 13, minus 25 bucks for that phone.
walter_wite How much meth did you sell?
jesse_pinkman Nearly an ounce.
walter_wite Last time I checked, there were 16 ounces to a pound.
walter_wite You smoked the rest? I've
jesse_pinkman I've been out there all night slinging crystal.
jesse_pinkman You think it's cake moving a pound of meth one teenth at a time?
walter_wite Why are you selling it in such small quanties?
walter_wite Why don't you just sell the whole pound at once?
jesse_pinkman To who?
jesse_pinkman What do I look like, Scarface?
walter_wite This is unacceptable.
walter_wite I am breaking the law here.
walter_wite This return is too little for the risk.
walter_wite I thought you'd be ready for another pound today.
jesse_pinkman You may know a lot about chemistry, but you don't know jack about slinging dope.
walter_wite Well, I'll tell you, I know a lack of motivation when I see it.
walter_wite You've got to be more imaginative, you know? Just
walter_wite Just think outside the box here.
walter_wite We have to move our product in bulk, wholesale,
walter_wite now. How do we do that?
jesse_pinkman you mean, to a distributor?
walter_wite Yes.
walter_wite Yes. That's what we need.
walter_wite We need a distributor now
walter_wite now. Do you know anyone like that?
jesse_pinkman Yeah, I mean I used to until you killed him.
walter_wite So who took Krazy8's place?
jesse_pinkman Some guy named Tuco.
jesse_pinkman ass, from what I hear.
walter_wite Tuco, okay.
walter_wite So then just go talk to Tuco.
jesse_pinkman Right.
jesse_pinkman Like," Hello, sir. Hey
jesse_pinkman Hey, I know you don't know me," but would you be interested in a felony quantity of methamphetamine?" Well
walter_wite Well, yes, but maybe with a little more salesmanship, perhaps?
jesse_pinkman You just don't get it, man.
jesse_pinkman This guy's O. G.
walter_wite What does that mean?
jesse_pinkman Jesus, look, he's upper level, man.
jesse_pinkman He's not going to do business with some dude he doesn't know.
jesse_pinkman You don't understand the way it works.
jesse_pinkman You can't just bum rush some highlevel ice man and start cutting deals,
jesse_pinkman It's
jesse_pinkman It's risky. You
jesse_pinkman You need an intro. You need someone to vouch.
walter_wite Well, who introduced you to Krazy8? Emilio
jesse_pinkman Emilio. That's only because I knew him from, like, third grade.
jesse_pinkman We can't talk to Emilio, either
walter_wite either All right, all right.
jesse_pinkman Look, I'm telling you, Mr. White, it's too risky.
jesse_pinkman I mean, we're making money.
jesse_pinkman Why can't you just be satisfied with the way it is
walter_wite is?
walter_wite Jesus!
walter_wite Just grow some fucking balls!
clinic's_clerk#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode06 Wait till Monday again?
walter_wite Yes, please.
hugo_archuleta Thank you. Mr. White.
walter_wite Thank you, Hugo.
carmen_molina Knockknock. Oh
walter_wite Oh, hey.
carmen_molina How are you feeling, Walt?
walter_wite Good
carmen_molina Are you up for having a visitor?
hank_schrader buddy.
walter_wite Hank.
carmen_molina Let me know if you need anything.
walter_wite I will.
walter_wite Thank you, Carmen.
hank_schrader Damn.
hank_schrader chick's got an ass like an onion.
walter_wite Makes me want to cry. So what are you doing here?
hank_schrader Well, I had some questions I wanted to run by you, workrelated.
hank_schrader You okay? I
hank_schrader I could come back later.
walter_wite No, no, no, no. I'm fine. Everything's fine.
walter_wite What
walter_white What do you mean workrelated, though?
hank_schrader Do you recognize that?
hank_schrader That was used to cook meth.
hank_schrader Found that on some Indian land about 40 miles from here.
hank_schrader label on the inside used to say
hank_schrader J. P. Wynne Chemistry Lab.
walter_wite Really?
walter_wite don't understand how that came from here.
hank_schrader I was hoping you could help me. We
hank_schrader We found it near an abandoned car belonging to one of our snitches.
walter_wite Yeah
hank_schrader Yeah, one of our confidential informants.
hank_schrader Went missing a while back.
hank_schrader No body yet, but we're pretty sure he's, you know
hank_schrader Probably chopped up in little pieces and fed to the buzzards.
hank_schrader Anyway, any respirators like that go missing lately?
walter_wite No. No.
walter_wite No,
walter_wite I mean, not that I know of.
hank_schrader I'll need to take a look at that inventory.
walter_wite Sure.
walter_wite I got a list hanging on the wall.
hank_schrader You mind if I take a look at your storeroom?
walter_wite Not at all,
walter_wite no.
walter_wite my guest.
hank_schrader So who's got keys?
walter_wite the science faculty, the staff, Carmen, the vice principal has the master, and me.
hank_schrader How about students?
walter_wite No, no.
walter_wite No students have keys.
hank_schrader I should hope not.
hank_schrader My question is do any know where you keep them?
walter_wite I don't think so. No.
walter_wite Besides, I keep them right here in my pocket anyway, so
hank_schrader Walt, look, I know they're your students, but, do not underestimate them.
hank_schrader Big mistake.
hank_schrader Are there any other respirators?
walter_wite no. Because
hank_schrader Because I'm counting six. Inventory says eight.
hank_schrader Glassware looking a little sparse.
walter_wite it?
hank_schrader Yeah.
hank_schrader missing a couple of Erlenmeyer flasks at least.
hank_schrader Oh, yeah.
hank_schrader 5,000 milliliter round bottom.
hank_schrader Meth heads love to brew in this, baby.
hank_schrader to answer
walter_wite just No, I don't
hank_schrader Maybe it's Skyler. She's in trouble or
hank_schrader Don't ignore it on my account. Answer
hank_schrader Answer it! C'mon
hank_schrader C'mon, I got stuff to do.
hank_schrader Okay
walter_wite Okay.
walter_wite Hello.
jesse_pinkman What's up, Mr. W?
walter_wite Speaking.
jesse_pinkman Bad time to talk?
walter_wite Absolutely. All
jesse_pinkman right, so just listen.
jesse_pinkman You know that guy we were talking about, Tuco?
jesse_pinkman Turns out my boy Skinny Pete was in the same cellblock with him over at Los Lunas.
jesse_pinkman So we got
jesse_pinkman our in. We're hauling
walter_wite a pound to the dude right
walter_wite right now. Okay, then. Thank
walter_wite Thank you very much for calling.
walter_wite My doctor is very solicitous.
hank_schrader Look, buddy,
hank_schrader the last thing I want to do is get you in hot water,
hank_schrader but some meth monkey had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?
hank_schrader You got to keep a better watch over your turf.
walter_wite I will.
hank_schrader We don't want people to start wondering about you, right?
walter_wite Right.
walter_wite No.
walter_wite Absolutely
walter_wite Absolutely not.
jesse_pinkman you're sure you're tight with this guy?
skinny_pete Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.
skinny_pete Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete!
jesse_pinkman this isn't such a good idea, yo. Come
skinny_pete on. Atta man. That's what's happening.

tuco_salamanca This your boy?
skinny_pete Yeah, Jesse. The
skinny_pete dude with the glass I was telling you about.
jesse_pinkman man. Yeah,
jesse_pinkman I've heard a lot about you.
tuco_salamanca Break out the ice.
jesse_pinkman worries, man. I'm no cop.
tuco_salamanca I said hit it.
tuco_salamanca This kicks like a mule with his balls wrapped in duct tape.
tuco_salamanca Where'd you get it?
jesse_pinkman I cooked it.
tuco_salamanca Bullshit!
tuco_salamanca working for?
jesse_pinkman No one, man. I
jesse_pinkman I mean, I have a partner that I cook with, but that's it.
tuco_salamanca All right.
tuco_salamanca We got a deal.
skinny_pete I told you Tuco would hook you up.
jesse_pinkman Cool.
jesse_pinkman I haven't said how much.
tuco_salamanca How much?
jesse_pinkman Well, you're a little light, ese.
tuco_salamanca It's
tuco_salamanca It's all right. Don't sweat it. It's
tuco_salamanca It's all good.
tuco_salamanca good. Walk
tuco_salamanca Walk. Get out of
jesse_pinkman What about the money?
tuco_salamanca You'll get it.
tuco_salamanca This is a consignment operation.
jesse_pinkman You want me to float 35 G's?
tuco_salamanca don't trust me?
jesse_pinkman No, no. Hey,
jesse_pinkman it's not that, man.
jesse_pinkman It's just, you know, I don't I don't do business that way. Tough
tuco_salamanca shit! The deal is
jesse_pinkman done! You said this was cool. Get money
jesse_pinkman money for meth. Cash up front.
skinny_pete Don't front, dude. Tuco's good for it
tuco_salamanca I don't need your punk ass to vouch for me!
jesse_pinkman Oh, come on!
tuco_salamanca All right
tuco_salamanca you brought me some really clean crystal.
tuco_salamanca you really want your money up front
tuco_salamanca Up front.
hank_schrader morning, Hugo.
hank_schrader Don't mind if I call you Hugo Hugo.
carmen_molina We've never had a crowd on the
walter_white_jr street like that.
hank_schrader Is
walter_white_jr Uncle Hank's arresting Mr. Archuleta.
carmen_molina This doesn't make any sense to me at all. I
carmen_molina I don't understand.
hank_schrader I got two words for you : background check.
hank_schrader How about that?
jesse_pinkman Yo, yo, yo. 1483369, representing the ABQ. What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone.
jesse_pinkman Where
walter_wite Where the hell are you?
walter_wite Call me back.
skyler_white Hey, Walt.
walter_wite Yeah?
skyler_white Hank's about to deal.
walter_wite Okay. I'll be right there.
hank_schrader All right. Let's see what the turn brings us.
marie_schrader You're looking good, Walt.
marie_schrader Your color's better.
walter_wite Yeah
walter_wite Thanks.
skyler_white He's actually on the pretty strong stuff now.
skyler_white Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into taking some time off from work, but Well
walter_wite Well, actually, I just talked to Carmen this morning, and they're getting a substitute for a few weeks.
marie_schrader I
walter_wite I just didn't have a chance to tell you.
walter_wite Sorry.
hank_schrader Your bet, tough guy.
walter_white_jr Check.
skyler_white Check.
marie_schrader Check's in the mail.
hank_schrader Red's 25 million. Blue's 10.
marie_schrader Then 25 million because that's how I roll.
walter_white_jr Hey, Uncle Hank, why were you arresting Mr. Archuleta the other day?
walter_white_jr He's a pretty cool guy.
hank_schrader Well, turns out that he has a record.
hank_schrader Yeah. Couple of possession beefs.
hank_schrader We figure he was the guy that was stealing your school's chemistry gear.
hank_schrader I mean, you know, he had a key. Fit the profile.
hank_schrader When we searched his truck, we found a big old fat blunt,
hank_schrader which goes to prove old Huge Hugo ain't so cool after all.
hank_schrader It's to you, Walt.
walter_wite Yeah, I'll call
skyler_white call. I can't believe the school system didn't know about this guy's record.
skyler_white I mean, that's pretty scary.
skyler_white How could something like that just slip through the cracks?
walter_wite I don't know.
walter_wite mean, for what it's worth, Hugo just doesn't strike me as the thief.
hank_schrader Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt, but you wouldn't know a criminal if he was close enough to check you for a hernia.
hank_schrader that said, we got a search warrant, and we tore old Hugo's house apart.
hank_schrader Turns out he's a major league pothead.
hank_schrader But he didn't raid your chemistry set.
hank_schrader You hiding something?
hank_schrader I'm in.
hank_schrader And the river card.
walter_white_jr Yeah, I got nothing. I'm out.
hank_schrader When old" holes in her purse" bails, you know you're in deep.
hank_schrader Looks like it's you and me, buddy.
walter_wite What's going to happen to him
walter_wite Hugo.
hank_schrader Well, I mean, he's going to lose his job, like he should.
hank_schrader Probably spend a couple months in County, as it's not his first rap.
hank_schrader I'm waiting.
hank_schrader You going to man up, or you're going to puss out?
skyler_white Hank.
walter_wite all in
hank_schrader You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar.
hank_schrader you smoking there
hank_schrader You got a heart?
hank_schrader You got the flush, don't you?
hank_schrader Not falling for it, buddy.
hank_schrader I fold.
marie_schrader Talk about anticlimactic. Your
hank_schrader Your cards
marie_schrader cards couldn't have been that bad.
marie_schrader Oh, my God. You
marie_schrader You threw away an ace What
hank_schrader What are you doing? Don't.
marie_schrader and a cowboy, for
marie_schrader handful of nothing.
walter_wite Who is this?
walter_wite I was dialing Jesse Pinkman.
skinny_pete Well
walter_wite Well, where is he, then?
skinny_pete You the guy?
walter_wite Yeah,
walter_wite I'm the guy. How is
skinny_pete Got some busted ribs and like that.
skinny_pete Got messed up pretty good.
skinny_pete I was all like" Damn, Tuco, chill, ese.
skinny_pete I don't know what got into him.
skinny_pete Seriously.
skinny_pete he's out, man,
skinny_pete way out.
skinny_pete They got him doped up bigtime.
skinny_pete So you're the cook, huh?
skinny_pete Yo, I didn't catch your name.
walter_wite Tell me about this Tuco.
walter_wite Tell me everything about him.
walter_wite Good morning.
walter_wite Would you pass the butter, please?
walter_white_jr ass, Dad.
walter_wite You Tuco?
walter_wite I want to talk to Tuco, and I'm not leaving until I do.
tuco_salamanca your name?
walter_wite Heisenberg.
tuco_salamanca Heisenberg.
tuco_salamanca Okay.
tuco_salamanca seat, Heisenberg.
walter_wite I don't imagine I'll be here very long.
tuco_salamanca No?
tuco_salamanca Be that
tuco_salamanca your meeting.
tuco_salamanca don't you start talking and tell me what you want?
walter_wite $50,000.
tuco_salamanca man! 50
tuco_salamanca 50 G's?
tuco_salamanca How you figure that?
walter_wite of meth you stole and another 15 for my partner's pain and suffering.
tuco_salamanca Oh, yeah. I remember that little bitch.
tuco_salamanca So you must be Daddy.
tuco_salamanca Let me get this straight.
tuco_salamanca I steal your dope, hmm? I beat the piss out of your mule boy! And then you walk in here, and you bring me more meth?
tuco_salamanca That's a brilliant plan, ese. Brilliant.
walter_wite You got one part of that wrong.
walter_wite This is not meth.
tuco_salamanca Are you nuts
walter_wite You want to find out?
tuco_salamanca NoDoze, Gonzo, calma! Calma. Calma.
tuco_salamanca You got balls. I'll give you that.
tuco_salamanca right. All right
tuco_salamanca I'll give you your money.
tuco_salamanca crystal that your partner brought me, it sold faster than $10 ass in TJ.
tuco_salamanca What say you bring me another pound next week?
walter_wite Money up front.
tuco_salamanca All right
tuco_salamanca up front. Sometimes you got to rob to keep your riches.
tuco_salamanca Just as long as we got an understanding.
walter_wite One pound is not going to cut it.
walter_wite You have to take two.
tuco_salamanca Orale.
tuco_salamanca What is that shit?
walter_wite Fulminated mercury. A little tweak of chemistry.

walter_white  Let's break it down.
walter_white  Hydrogen.
walter_white  What does that give us?
gretchen_schwartz  By mole? We're looking at 63%.
walter_white  is a big bite.
walter_white  My next step's gotta be oxygen.
gretchen_schwartz  Oxygen : 26%.
walter_white  There
walter_white  There you have your water. Carbon
gretchen_schwartz  Carbon : 9%. Carbon
walter_white  Carbon : 9.
gretchen_schwartz  For a total of 98%? Right.
walter_white  Nitrogen
gretchen_schwartz  Nitrogen : 1. 25%.
walter_white  1. 25.
gretchen_schwartz  That brings it to 99 and a quarter.
gretchen_schwartz  Which only leaves you with the trace elements down where the magic happens.
walter_white  Oh, wait a
walter_white  minute. What
walter_white  calcium? Calcium's not a trace. Got
walter_white  Got a whole skeleton to account for.
gretchen_schwartz  You would think, right? Right.
walter_white  Calcium
gretchen_schwartz  Calcium.
gretchen_schwartz  Calcium is only. 25%.
walter_white  That low?
walter_white  Seriously?
walter_white  Damn, I never would have thought that.
walter_white  Okay, so where does iron fit in?
gretchen_schwartz  Iron.
gretchen_schwartz  Wow, okay.. 00004%. What
walter_white  What?
walter_white  You can't have hemoglobin without iron.
gretchen_schwartz  Apparently, it don't take much.
walter_white  No
walter_white  No, it don't.
walter_white  Sodium. Sodium:
gretchen_schwartz  Sodium:. 04.
gretchen_schwartz  Phosphorus:. 19.. 19.
walter_white  There
walter_white  we go
walter_white  So, the whole thing adds up to We
walter_white  We are. 111958% shy. Supposedly that's everything
gretchen_schwartz  I don't know. I just
walter_white  I just Just
walter_white  seems like something's missing, doesn't it?
walter_white  There got to be more to a human being than that.
marie_schrader  These shoes
marie_schrader  shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans, like I should be squeaking around bringing soup to some disgusting old person, then take the bus home to my 16 cats.
walter_white_jr.  Then why are you wearing them?
marie_schrader  I like the support.
marie_schrader  My arches happen to be extremely archy.

marie_schrader  Should you be up on that ladder?
skyler_white  You're more than welcome to take over for me up here.
marie_schrader  I don't see why you don't just get Walt to do it.
skyler_white  Yeah. There's
skyler_white  an idea. So, I'm working on this new short story, and there's this stoner character in it, and I'm trying to
skyler_white  Well, know you, actually, let me back up.
skyler_white  You've smoked your fair share of pot in college, didn't you?
skyler_white  I mean, you at least tried it
skyler_white  Come on
marie_schrader  I perhaps tried it.
marie_schrader  Why?
skyler_white  Do you rember it having an effect on your mood, like
skyler_white  like changing it in any major way
marie_schrader  It made me more serious.
skyler_white  Really?
skyler_white  Because I mostly rember it made me lightheaded. That's about it.
skyler_white  I was just wondering if it maybe could
skyler_white  You know, it's just a character thing I'm stuck on.
skyler_white  Never mind
marie_schrader  Walter Jr. 's on pot?
skyler_white  What?
skyler_white  No!

marie_schrader  What are you going to do about this?
skyler_white  You need to look me in the eye.
skyler_white  I am strictly asking about a story that I am writing, that's all.
skyler_white  Right hand to God, Walter Jr. is not on pot. Certainly not as far as I know.

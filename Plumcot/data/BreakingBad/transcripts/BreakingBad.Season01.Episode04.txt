hank_schrader  Anyway. Say hello to Domingo Gallardo Molina,
hank_schrader  AKA" Krazy 8.
hank_schrader  Smarter than your average cheeseeater.
hank_schrader  I turned him out at the streetlevel, but this dude's like the Jeffersons : movin' on up. Every
steven_gomez  Every smalltime dealers he'd throw at us, he'd end up snaking their customers. It
hank_schrader  It turns out he's missing, presumed dead
hank_schrader  dead. Found his car out in the boonies.
hank_schrader  Last guy he ratted out was none other than his cousin, Emilio Koyama.
dea_agent_#1  You thinking the cousin found out and took revenge? Could
hank_schrader  Could be. Turns out he's missing, too.
hank_schrader  Normally, I'd say someone did the world a favor.
hank_schrader  But our snitch's car? Turns out we find two grams of meth in it, we take it to the lab. They come back, they tell us it is the purest they have ever seen.
steven_gomez  Our
hank_schrader  Our chemist was blown away.
hank_schrader  He said he couldn't do the same thing better.
hank_schrader  Worse yet, it didn't come out of some superlab in Mexico. We're thinking this was cooked right here, in the Land of Enchantment.
hank_schrader  Car was abandoned at what appears to be a cook site.
hank_schrader  This is the only other thing left behind.
hank_schrader  We're sending it off to Quantico, see if they can pull something off it.
hank_schrader  Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter element and found the same 99. 1 meth.
hank_schrader  So be on notice.
hank_schrader  We got new players in town.
hank_schrader  We don't know who they are, where they come from but they possess an extremely high skillset.
hank_schrader  Me personally? Jesus. Walt, you're burning
hank_schrader  the shit out of them. Damn it.

hank_schrader  Emeril here is gonna need a fresh pack.

skyler_white  I don't know. It's storebought.
walter_white  Hank, you need another beer?
hank_schrader  the Pope shit in his hat?
marie_schrader  I don't think that he does, Hank. And I think everybody would like it if you'd stop saying that.
walter_white  Marie, some more wine, maybe?
marie_schrader  I'm all right, thanks.
walter_white  Hey
walter_white_jr.  Hey, I want a beer.
hank_schrader  Yeah. I want Shania Twain to give me a tuggie.

walter_white  How about some more soda?
walter_white_jr.  sure. Honey
walter_white  Honey, do you need anything?
skyler_white  Walt. Thank you.
hank_schrader  What, are you kidding me?
hank_schrader  You look like a damn movie star, man.
hank_schrader  Girls gotta be lining up left and right.
hank_schrader  Tell him how goodlooking he is.
marie_schrader  He's adorable. He
hank_schrader  He don't wanna be friggin' adorable. He wants to be hot.
hank_schrader  You see what I'm talking about? That's
hank_schrader  That's a female perspective.
walter_white_jr.  She supposed to say that.
hank_schrader  Look, a guy doesn't have to look like, uh Charlton Heston I'm
hank_schrader  I'm talking" Moses"
hank_schrader  to get a girl, all right? You
hank_schrader  just gotta have confidence. Confidence
hank_schrader  Confidence and and persistence.
hank_schrader  That's what I'm talking about.
hank_schrader  I chased your Aunt Marie here all over creation.
hank_schrader  I kept bugging her for a date. She kept saying no.
hank_schrader  What, did I ask you like 50 times?
marie_schrader  It was before they tightened the stalking laws.
hank_schrader  Anyway, how about your dad here?
hank_schrader  Right there's a good story, Walt.
hank_schrader  him how you met Skyler.
walter_white_jr.  Mom was a waitress in Los Alamos. And Dad said that thing to you Actually
walter_white  Actually, your mother wasn't a waitress. It was a summer job, and she was the hostess, and she also worked the cash register.
walter_white  And I used to go in there a lot because it was close enough to the lab where I could ride my bicycle.
walter_white  And once I noticed her it got to be so that I would only go in when I knew she was working.
walter_white  When it was slow, she would lean against the counter, doing her crossword puzzles, but kind of hiding it, right, pretending that she was still working. And once I caught on to that, I would do crossword puzzles while I ate my grilled cheese sandwich.
walter_white  It got so that everyday at lunch, we would both be doing the New York Times crossword puzzle ten feet from each other.
walter_white  Eventually, I caught her looking over at me. So, I began saying,
walter_white " Excuse me." Fourteen across, sevenletter word for whatchamacallit." May I ask what you wrote down?"
walter_white  That got us talking. Boy, I tell you, I was I was terrible at those puzzles.
walter_white  I don't think that I finished even one of them.
walter_white  But your mother would do them in ink.
hank_schrader  Very smooth.
hank_schrader  I'll bet you didn't think your old man had it in him?
hank_schrader  But that's what I'm talking about. That's persistence. You see?
hank_schrader  Once you set your cap for something, or somebody, you gotta just, you know
hank_schrader  Mom
walter_white_jr.  Mom, are you all right? Shh
marie_schrader  What's the matter?
skyler_white  What
marie_schrader  What is it? Ask him. What's she talking about?
marie_schrader  Walt.
walter_white  I have cancer.
walter_white  Lung cancer.
walter_white  It's bad.
marie_schrader  Ask him how long he's known.
walter_white  I guess a month, maybe,
marie_schrader  or For God sakes, Walt.
marie_schrader  We're just sitting out there having a cookout like nothing's going on?
skyler_white  He made me promise not to tell anybody.

walter_white  headaches. Honey, it wasn't that.
skyler_white  How do they think they can get away with this?

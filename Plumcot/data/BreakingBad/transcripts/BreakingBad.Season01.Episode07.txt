police_officer_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 In closing, I can tell you we take this very seriously.
police_officer_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 APD as well as the DEA.
police_officer_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 Stopping the manufacture and sale of methamphetamines remains one of our highest priorities.
police_officer_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 And the theft of lab equipment from your school is also receiving our highest attention.
police_officer_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 Rest assured, no stone will go unturned in our search for the person or persons responsible for this.
police_officer_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 If you have any questions, now would be the time.
concerned_parent_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 You're talking like you haven't caught anybody yet
concerned_parent_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 What about the janitor that was dealing drugs at the school?
carmen_molina There is no indication that this individual was selling drugs.
carmen_molina He was arrested for having a small amount of marijuana in his car, not in the school.
carmen_molina And he's since been fired.
concerned_parent_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 I heard he had a record.
concerned_parent_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 I'd like to know how he got a job here in the first place.
concerned_parent_#2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 Why wasn't there a background check?
carmen_molina There was one.
carmen_molina We're currently reviewing our hiring policies.
concerned_parent_#3#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 You better be doing more than that.
concerned_parent_#3#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 He was arrested in front of my daughter.
concerned_parent_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 This guy was stealing the lab equipment, right?
police_officer_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 That's not our thinking at this time.
police_officer_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 We are looking at others who had access, not limited to the maintenance staff.
concerned_parent_#2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 Are you saying there was a breakin?
concerned_parent_#2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 Do we know exactly when this happened?
concerned_parent_#2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 mean, could it have been during school hours?
police_officer_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 We haven't been able to establish a date or time, but
police_officer_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 but there is no sign of breaking or entering.
concerned_parent_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 Whoever took it had a key?
concerned_parent_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 We're talking inside job?
concerned_parent_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 Someone who's still at the school?
police_officer_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 At this time I'm not able to discuss the details, but
police_officer_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 but what I can tell you is that we have some very good people working very hard on this case.
concerned_parent_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 I'm sorry, Officer. But that sounds like doubletalk.
concerned_parent_#2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 We're trying to protect our children.
concerned_parent_#2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 You have to level with us.
carmen_molina Really, we are giving you all the information we have. You
concerned_parent_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 You know what I'd like to see in this school?
concerned_parent_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 Drugsniffing dogs.
concerned_parent_#2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 Yeah
concerned_parent_#2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 dogs, and metal detectors, and locker searches, and strip searches. Our
carmen_molina Our district has strict policies I heard about
concerned_parent_#2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 about this school in Canada. They arrested one of their groundskeepers with drugs. And the next day they found out over half of the students were high on LSD. LSD
concerned_parent_#2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 LSD? When
concerned_parent_#2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 When were you gonna tell us
carmen_molina about the LSD? The equipment was
concerned_parent_#1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season01.Episode07 was taken
carmen_molina taken from our chemistry department. And I would like someone to give us some specifics. Walt? Yeah.
carmen_molina Mr. White is currently on medical leave.
carmen_molina But as he's chair of the science department, he's made a very special effort to be with us here.
carmen_molina And I'd like to take a moment to thank him for that.

jesse_pinkman Acting like you were all out for blood.
jesse_pinkman You are alive,
jesse_pinkman obviously you wised up.
walter_white No, I did go see him.
jesse_pinkman Bullshit.
walter_white Are you selling your house?
jesse_pinkman I got two dudes that turned into raspberry slushie and flushed down my toilet.
jesse_pinkman I can't even take a proper dump in there.
jesse_pinkman The whole damn house has got to be haunted by now.
jesse_pinkman You didn't actually go see Tuco?
walter_white That is seventeenfive. Your
walter_white Your half of the 35,000.
walter_white Plus there's an extra 15 in there.
walter_white It's all yours.
walter_white You've earned it.
jesse_pinkman You got this money from Tuco.
walter_white Yeah.
jesse_pinkman So Tuco gave you this is what you're saying.
walter_white We made a deal.
jesse_pinkman You made a deal?
walter_white right. Wait
jesse_pinkman Why
jesse_pinkman Why would you make a deal with that scumbag?
jesse_pinkman You see what he did to me?
walter_white Because I think that we can do business together.
walter_white We came to an understanding.
jesse_pinkman No way, man!
jesse_pinkman Okay?
jesse_pinkman No understanding. Take
walter_white Take a look at the money in your hand
walter_white Now just imagine making that every week.
walter_white That's right.
walter_white Two pounds a week. Without
jesse_pinkman Without even talking to me, you told this insane ass clown deadeyed killer that
jesse_pinkman that we would give him two pounds a week?
walter_white We'll just scale up our operation. We'll add a few more hours Don't
jesse_pinkman Don't talk to me about hours.
jesse_pinkman What about pseudo, man?
jesse_pinkman How are we gonna get that?
jesse_pinkman You think the meth fairy is just gonna bring it to us?
jesse_pinkman It takes me a week to get this stuff.
jesse_pinkman I'm driving all the way out to Las Cruces. to meet up with my smurfs Smurfs
walter_white Smurfs?
jesse_pinkman Dudes who go to the drugstores and get a couple boxes at a time and then sell them to me.
jesse_pinkman And that's maybe only good for, like, maybe a halfpound worth.
jesse_pinkman See, that's the bottleneck in your brilliant business plan.
walter_white All right. Of
jesse_pinkman Of course you would have known that if you would have just asked me.
dr_delcavoli Well, here we are again.

dr_delcavoli Sure, I'll take that.
dr_delcavoli Right, Walt?
walter_white Couldn't
skyler_white Couldn't that mean that the chemo is working?
dr_delcavoli Realistically, it may just mean that we've got the antiemetics tuned right.
dr_delcavoli Truth is, until Walt's finished this round of chemo and we look at a new PET scan, we just can't say for sure.
walter_white Isn't there anything else we could be doing?
walter_white I've been wondering about alternative medicine.
skyler_white I mean, Eastern healing.
skyler_white You know, holistic.
dr_delcavoli Well, I can't speak to its efficacy. But as long as it doesn't interfere with our treatment, anything that helps my patient have a better outlook, a better comfort, is fine by me.
skyler_white So you're saying it's all psychological. It
skyler_white doesn't make any real difference.
dr_delcavoli Having a better outlook can make a tremendous difference.
dr_delcavoli But it's also important that we manage our expectations.
walter_white What?
jesse_pinkman junkyard?

walter_white Cuban.
hank_schrader I did a little favor for an FBI guy.
walter_white Now, I was under the impression that these were illegal,
hank_schrader Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest, doesn't it
walter_white It's funny, isn't it?
walter_white How we draw that line.
hank_schrader Yeah?
hank_schrader line is that?
walter_white Well, what's legal, what's illegal,
walter_white Cuban cigars, alcohol.
walter_white You know, if we were drinking this in 1930, we'd be breaking the law.
walter_white Another year, we'd be okay.
walter_white Who knows what will be legal next year?
hank_schrader You mean like pot?
walter_white Yeah.
walter_white Like pot
walter_white pot. Or whatever
hank_schrader Cocaine?
hank_schrader Heroin?
walter_white I'm just saying it's arbitrary.
hank_schrader Well, you ought to visit lockup. You
hank_schrader You hear a lot of guys talking like that.
hank_schrader man, why'd you bust me with these 14 bales of ganja?"
hank_schrader It's all gonna be legal next year when Willie Nelson's president.
hank_schrader Shit, buddy,
hank_schrader doesn't only go one way, either.
hank_schrader Sometimes there's stuff that's legal that shouldn't be.
hank_schrader I mean, friggin' meth used to be legal.
hank_schrader Used to sell it over every counter at every pharmacy across America.
hank_schrader Thank God they came to their senses on that one, huh?
walter_white Nice party.
skyler_white tiara.
skyler_white A white gold tiara for a newborn baby.
skyler_white Yeah.
skyler_white You know, I think she got that at Gertrude Zachary's in Nob Hill.
skyler_white I mean, that thing must have cost, like, what, $500 or $600.
skyler_white I think I'm going to return it.
walter_white You sure
walter_white She's bound to find out.
skyler_white Well, maybe I can explain to her that we need a Diaper Genie more than a white gold baby tiara.
walter_white You know, I've been thinking about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli about alternative medicine.
skyler_white Don't
skyler_white Don't worry. I'm
skyler_white I'm not going to mention that anymore.
walter_white What
walter_white What I mean is that maybe there is something to it.
walter_white Here.
walter_white They do this Navajo sweat lodge up by Farmington.
walter_white Healing ceremony.
walter_white It's supposed to be good for your lungs.
walter_white I'm not saying that I believe in it, but you know, it might be an experience.
skyler_white Really?
skyler_white You?
skyler_white In a sweat lodge?
walter_white I was thinking about driving up on Friday, coming back Sunday. I
walter_white I mean, if you're okay with it.
skyler_white Well, of course I'm okay with that.
jesse_pinkman Sweat lodge?
walter_white Yeah.
jesse_pinkman I'm already sweating.
jesse_pinkman Help me
walter_white me out
walter_white out. Okay. Right.
walter_white Excellent.
walter_white This is excellent.
walter_white Very good work.
jesse_pinkman straight. Okay
walter_white Okay. Hydrogen.
walter_white Electrolytically produced, yes?
jesse_pinkman Yeah, like you asked
jesse_pinkman I mean
jesse_pinkman this crap wasn't easy to get.
jesse_pinkman It was expensive.
walter_white Methylamine. Where's
walter_white Where's the methylamine?
walter_white I don't see the methylamine.
jesse_pinkman Yeah, well, that's where I ran into some trouble.
walter_white What kind of trouble
jesse_pinkman Well, half this crap I could just buy, right?
jesse_pinkman But this methylamine
jesse_pinkman not so easy.
jesse_pinkman They got it locked down tight.
jesse_pinkman But I did find some pros who will rip it off for us.
jesse_pinkman they want 10 grand.
walter_white So what's the problem?
walter_white You have the money.
jesse_pinkman No, had.
jesse_pinkman already spent almost the whole wad. I
jesse_pinkman I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.
jesse_pinkman I told you, all this crap was expensive.
walter_white So these thieves, did they say where they would be stealing it from?
jesse_pinkman a chemical supply place south of town.
jesse_pinkman They got guards and security cameras, big
jesse_pinkman big ass steel doors.
jesse_pinkman That's why these dudes are charging so much.
jesse_pinkman What?
walter_white So why don't we just steal it ourselves?
jesse_pinkman Yeah?
jesse_pinkman How are we going to do that?
walter_white With this.
jesse_pinkman So what's this stuff called again?
walter_white Thermite.
jesse_pinkman And that will cut through a lock?
jesse_pinkman Because this is supposed to be one big ass lock.
walter_white World War II, the Germans had an artillery piece,
walter_white it's the biggest in the world,
walter_white called the Gustav Gun,
walter_white it weighed a thousand tons.
walter_white And the Gustav was capable of firing a 7ton shell and hitting a target accurately 23 miles away.
walter_white I mean, you could drop bombs on it every day for a month without ever disabling it
walter_white But you drop a commando, one man, with just a bag of this and he could melt right through and destroy that gun forever. Jeez!
jesse_pinkman So
walter_white So yes. I think it will cut through any lock we're likely to find.
jewelry_store_owner You'd like to return this?
skyler_white It's very nice, but yes.
skyler_white Well,
skyler_white it is from the store, isn't it?
jewelry_store_owner Oh, yes. It's from this store.

skyler_white A baby shower gift. So
jewelry_store_owner So who gave it to you, then?
skyler_white I don't think I have to tell you that.
jewelry_store_owner You don't have to tell me anything.
jewelry_store_owner You can talk to the police,
jewelry_store_owner and I can tell them how my daughterinlaw remembers showing this particular item to a tall blonde woman who, when her back was turned, walked right out the door with it.
jewelry_store_owner So there.
skyler_white Oh, yeah?
skyler_white Then I can talk to the Channel 3 News.
skyler_white I can tell them how you people, without a shred,
skyler_white without a modicum of evidence, illegally detained an innocent pregnant woman in a dank storeroom.
jewelry_store_owner This is my office. I
skyler_white I feel I'm being held hostage.
skyler_white Furthermore, I'm not getting enough air back here.
skyler_white I don't think I can breathe.
skyler_white Oh, my God. Oh
skyler_white Oh, no.
skyler_white I'm going into labor.
skyler_white Yes,
marie_schrader Marie

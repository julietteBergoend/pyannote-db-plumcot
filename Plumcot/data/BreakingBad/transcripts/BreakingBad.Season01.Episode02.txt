walter_white_jr Yeah .
walter_white_jr I'm good .
skyler_white You

jesse_pinkman Yo , yo , yo , 1483369 , representing the ABQ .
jesse_pinkman What up , biatch ?
jesse_pinkman Leave it at the tone .
walter_white So , the term " chiral " derives from the Greek word " hand .
walter_white The concept here being that , just as your left hand , and your right hand are mirror images of one another , right ?
walter_white Identical , and yet opposite .
walter_white Well , so too organic compounds can exist as mirror image forms of one another all the way down at the molecular level .
walter_white But although they may look the same , they don't always behave the same .
walter_white For instance I'm sorry
walter_white For For instance Thalidomide .
walter_white The righthanded isomer of the drug Thalidomide is a perfectly fine good medicine to give to a pregnant woman to prevent morning sickness
walter_white but
walter_white but , make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman the lefthanded isomer of the drug Thalidomide , and her child will be born with horrible birth defects .
walter_white Which is precisely what happened in the 1950s .
walter_white So , chiral , chirality , mirrored images , right ?
walter_white Active , inactive .
walter_white Good , Yes , Ben ?
ben Is this gonna be on the murder ?
walter_white Is
ben Is this gonna be on the midterm ?
walter_white chirality on the midterm ?
walter_white No , well , maybe , maybe , you know ,
walter_white but but prepare for it to be on the midterm .
walter_white Can't hurt to know it
walter_white , right ?
walter_white Knowledge is power !
jesse_pinkman Oh ,
walter_white no , no Not good .
skyler_white What the hell
jesse_pinkman Now what ?
walter_white The other one , out in the RV , You're sure ?
jesse_pinkman Yes .
walter_white Positive ?
jesse_pinkman Feel free free to go check it yourself .
jesse_pinkman Yes
walter_white Yes , good idea .
walter_white Maybe I should do that before he , too , wanders off on the damn street !
jesse_pinkman Okay , you know what
jesse_pinkman , I I
jesse_pinkman All right ,
walter_white all right !
walter_white The
jesse_pinkman The one downstairs , tell me about him .
walter_white Come on , anything , something !
walter_white Start with his name , at least !
jesse_pinkman Krazy8 .
walter_white Krazy8 ?
walter_white What the hell does that even mean ?
jesse_pinkman I don't know , man
jesse_pinkman , okay ?
jesse_pinkman I mean , he's like , Krazy8 ,
jesse_pinkman okay ?
jesse_pinkman I don't know .
walter_white So , you work with him regularly ?
jesse_pinkman No , not him so much .
jesse_pinkman His cousin , mainly .
walter_white Who's his cousin ?
jesse_pinkman The guy out in the RV
walter_white RV !
walter_white All right ,
jesse_pinkman right .
jesse_pinkman Krazy8's one level higher .
walter_white One level higher ?
jesse_pinkman Yeah , you know , not like street level Higher .
jesse_pinkman You know , there's like a Starbucks at every corner ?
jesse_pinkman Krazy8 is , like , the dude that sells Starbucks his beans .
walter_white Okay , so he's a distributor .
walter_white Okay , so , is he
walter_white I mean , is he he
walter_white In
walter_white In other words
walter_white What is his reputation for violence ?
jesse_pinkman Well , um He did try to kill us both yesterday , so there's that .
walter_white What I'm trying to say is that he's a distributor , right ?
walter_white He's a He's a businessman , he's a man of business .
walter_white It would therefore seem to follow that he is capable of acting out of mutual selfinterest , yes ?
walter_white Do you think he is capable of listening to reason ?
jesse_pinkman What kind of reason ?
jesse_pinkman Like " Dear Krazy8 , listen, "
jesse_pinkman if I let you go , will you promise not to come back and waste my family ?
jesse_pinkman No Colombian neckties .
jesse_pinkman You mean that kind of reason ?
jesse_pinkman No , man , I can't say as I have high hopes where that's concerned .
walter_white what ?
jesse_pinkman gotta tie him
walter_white Why Why the hell
jesse_pinkman hell didn't we tie him up
jesse_pinkman Because
jesse_pinkman But what if he's faking it ?
jesse_pinkman Like if it was me , I'd be all faking being knocked out , yo !
jesse_pinkman And then , when the coast is clear , I'd be up looking for weapons and shit , waiting to pounce !
jesse_pinkman Now if it was me , and I couldn't find a decent enough weapon now
jesse_pinkman what do we do ?
walter_white You keep asking me that like you think I have some answer .
jesse_pinkman Well , you gotta do something
walter_white something !
walter_white We have got to do something , and I am opened to suggestions .
jesse_pinkman Man , uhuh , okay , this whole thing was your deal
walter_white deal !
walter_white Don't you dare put that on me !
walter_white You brought those guys out there , this is your responsability !
jesse_pinkman Like I came to you , begging to cook meth .
jesse_pinkman "
jesse_pinkman Nerdiest old dude
jesse_pinkman I know , you wanna come
jesse_pinkman cook crystal?
jesse_pinkman "
jesse_pinkman Please !
jesse_pinkman I'd ask my diaperwearing granny , but her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the RV .
jesse_pinkman What about the the phosphate gas ?
walter_white Phosphine gas .
walter_white What about it ?
jesse_pinkman I mean , do you think it still might kill him ?
jesse_pinkman You know , with like a delayed reaction or something ?
walter_white I don't know .
jesse_pinkman You're supposed to be a scientist !
walter_white This isn't even the issue that demands immediate attention .
walter_white We have got a body in that RV , and it's getting warmer outside , understand ?
walter_white And we have got to do something about that soon .
walter_white And in a way that no one will ever find it .
walter_white Now that last part is very , very important .
walter_white Therefore , it seems to me that our best course of action would be chemical disincorporation .
walter_white Dissolving in strong acid .
jesse_pinkman Oh man , that's messed
jesse_pinkman You're not
jesse_pinkman You're not serious ?
jesse_pinkman You're serious ?
jesse_pinkman Who's gonna do that ?
jesse_pinkman And don't look at me !
walter_white I guess we'll both do it together .
jesse_pinkman No , Mr . White , okay , I'm not good with dead bodies .
walter_white We're in this 50/50 , I guess the only other fair way to go about this would be that one of us deals with the body situation , while the other one of us deals with the Krazy8 situation .
walter_white a scenario like this , I don't suppose it is bad form to just flip a coin .
walter_white Heads or tails ?
jesse_pinkman I'll do the body in the acid ,
jesse_pinkman okay ?
walter_white Heads or tails ?
jesse_pinkman Heads .
walter_white Best two out of three ?
walter_white Yo ,
jesse_pinkman yo , yo , 1483369 , representing the ABQ .
jesse_pinkman What up , biatch ?

walter_white Polyethylene .
jesse_pinkman How the hell am I supposed to know that ?
walter_white Because I told you .
walter_white Look , just look at the bottom for a triangle stamped " LDPE .
walter_white " It should be molded right into the plastic .
jesse_pinkman Yeah , yeah , LDPE .
jesse_pinkman Right
jesse_pinkman Right on , got it know ,
jesse_pinkman man , this feels kind of flimsy .
jesse_pinkman Any decent acid's gonna eat right through this .
walter_white Not hydrofluoric .
jesse_pinkman Why not ?
walter_white Look , you skipped , clowned around or otherwise jerked off to every lecture I ever gave .
walter_white As far as I'm concerned , your chemistry education is over .
jesse_pinkman Oh , okay .
jesse_pinkman Be a dick about it .
jesse_pinkman So , hey , have you Have you done the thing ?
walter_white Yeah , I'm working up to it .
jesse_pinkman what ?

jesse_pinkman Yeah , that's right .
jesse_pinkman She almost caught me moving Emilio !
jesse_pinkman Good job in wearing the pants in the family .
jesse_pinkman And why did you go and tell her I was selling you weed ?
walter_white Because somehow , it seemed preferable to admitting that I cook crystal meth and killed a man .
walter_white Is that what I think it is ?

walter_white up .
walter_white Well , boohoo .
walter_white I have the truly awful job here .
jesse_pinkman You wanna talk awful ?
jesse_pinkman You You wanna go there ?

walter_white What
walter_white What do you mean, " bathtub "

walter_white I'm sorry , what were you asking me ?
walter_white Oh , yes .
walter_white That stupid plastic container
walter_white I asked you to buy .
walter_white You see , hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic .
walter_white It will however dissolve metal , rock , glass , ceramic .
walter_white So there's that .

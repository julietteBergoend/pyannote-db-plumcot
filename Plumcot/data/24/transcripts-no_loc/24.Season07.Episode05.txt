not_available Previously on 24.
not_available This is Colonel Iké Dubaku.
not_available We have the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available We demand the complete withdrawal of the U.S.
not_available Naval strike force by this time tomorrow.
not_available You are recalling the invasion force.
not_available Well, that determination has yet to be made.
not_available I implore you.
not_available Do not abandon my country.
not_available It's Samantha Roth.
not_available She says she has new information regarding my son's death.
not_available Roger was tasked with auditing the brokers in his department.
not_available He uncovered other blind accounts
not_available accounts that were traced to a senior member of your wife's administration.
not_available It's all here
not_available account numbers, trading records, everything that he knew.
not_available Bauer must've worked out this escape with Almeida's people.
not_available That son of a bitch played me.
not_available Had me believing the Bureau was compromised someone on the inside working against us.
not_available I realize now it was him all along.
not_available He played us both.
not_available I'm gonna make this right, Larry.
not_available Whatever it takes, I will find Bauer and Almeida.
not_available You're out of time, Mr.
not_available Tanner.
not_available Tell me what you know.
not_available I'm not gonna tell you a damn thing.
not_available Where is Almeida? 
not_available Tanner says Almeida's crew has a plan to abduct the former prime minister of Sangala.
not_available Matobo? When? 
not_available Pretty much now.
not_available Why didn't you call the authorities? 
not_available He couldn't, Jack.
not_available Why not? He found out Emerson's client was Dubaku.
not_available That's who you believe has agents inside the government? Dubaku's the key to this thing, Jack.
not_available If we're gonna uncover the conspiracy we have to get to him before he leaves the U.S.
not_available I got away from the F.B.I.
not_available Yeah, I heard.
not_available I also heard it was Jack Bauer who broke you out.
not_available He's on board now.
not_available Package is a person.
not_available Former Prime Minster Matobo of Sangala.
not_available Assignment is to grab him, deliver him to Colonel Dubaku.
not_available Where's Matobo? Where is he? It's a safe room, reinforced concrete.
not_available Jack, we leave here without Matobo, we lose our only chance of getting at Dubaku.
not_available The following takes place between 12:00 p.m.
not_available And 1:00 p.m.
not_available Matobo's security chief said there's a safe room at his residence.
not_available They should have him and his wife locked down by now.
not_available They'll be safe till your team gets there.
not_available Your priority is to grab Almeida and bring him back here.
not_available We'll make every effort to use nonlethal force, but Almeida's crew is ex
not_available military.
not_available They're gonna be hard to subdue unless my men can return fire.
not_available I understand you'll be exposing your men, but it's a risk you need to take.
not_available Sir
not_available Almeida is the only viable lead we've got to retrieve the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available You need to bring him in alive.
not_available Is that understood? Understood.
not_available Let's move out.
not_available We'll get our updates in the van.
not_available Open the safe room.
not_available I will keep going until you open the door.
not_available I've already told you.
not_available Once it's closed, you can only open it from the inside.
not_available Do whatever you want to me, but you'll never get into that room.
not_available We've got to get Matobo.
not_available Without him, we've got nothin'.
not_available I know.
not_available Find a way in yet? 
not_available No.
not_available Litvak, any luck reconnecting the intercom? Not yet.
not_available I'm workin' on it.
not_available Sir, this just came in.
not_available I'm in the middle of a field op, Erika.
not_available I don't really have time now.
not_available It's from the Attorney General.
not_available I think you should make time for this.
not_available What is it? Tanner's lawyers are filing a complaint against the Bureau.
not_available Walker.
not_available Renee, it's me.
not_available I'm less than 15 minutes away from Matobo's house.
not_available When I get there, I'll recon for the tac team.
not_available Stop a second.
not_available What? This information about Matobo being abducted
not_available Tell me how you got it.
not_available You know how I got it.
not_available I questioned Tanner.
not_available You questioned him? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tanner's lawyers are saying you locked them out of his hospital room then cut off his ventilator.
not_available They said you applied pressure to his gunshot wound.
not_available We needed Almeida's location.
not_available Tanner was not about to cooperate.
not_available So you tortured him.
not_available What the hell were you thinking? I got the information we needed.
not_available Information that may not even be valid.
not_available You know as well as I do, coercive interrogation is unreliable.
not_available No, Tanner was not lying.
not_available You know that? How do you know he wasn't telling you what you wanted to hear? I'll find out when I get to Matobo's house.
not_available You're not goin' to Matobo's.
not_available You're comin' back here to the office.
not_available The Attorney General is sending somebody here.
not_available You're gonna tell 'em everything that happened.
not_available What? Larry.
not_available It's my fault that Bauer and Almeida are still at large.
not_available Please let me play this out.
not_available I will deal with the consequences after we find the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available No.
not_available The field team is on the way.
not_available They can handle this.
not_available Renee, get here back now.
not_available I'm sorry, Larry, but I need to make this right.
not_available Renee? 
not_available Damn it.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Glad you're all right, babe.
not_available The flight attendant said something about us getting a priority clearance to land.
not_available You got lucky.
not_available Did I? I mean, it happened just after we spoke so I thought maybe you had something to do with it.
not_available Me? How could I have done anything? Listen.
not_available I might be late tonight.
not_available There's a lot going on at work.
not_available I haven't seen you in a week.
not_available I thought we could spend some time together
not_available dinner and maybe, you know.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I have to go.
not_available I have to get back to work.
not_available Call me later.
not_available Okay.
not_available Did you deploy the field teams? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available They just left.
not_available We need to coordinate with Matobo's security chief.
not_available Get him back on the line.
not_available These people
not_available they work for Dubaku, don't they? Possibly.
not_available Yes, probably.
not_available But if they wanted me dead, I would be dead.
not_available Then what do they want? 
not_available Names.
not_available Names? 
not_available Of my allies inside Sangala.
not_available You would die before you exposed them.
not_available They know that.
not_available Yes, they do, but
not_available Then it's me.
not_available It's me.
not_available They want to use me to get you to talk? Don't worry.
not_available We'll be safe in here until they leave.
not_available Ule, I'm scared.
not_available Alama, listen to me.
not_available We need to stay calm.
not_available We'll be fine.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Knows we're here.
not_available They'll come for us soon.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Matobo.
not_available I know you can see and hear me.
not_available Come out now, and nobody has to get hurt.
not_available You're wasting your time.
not_available Come out now, or I will kill your man.
not_available You have one minute.
not_available Fifty.
not_available I am prepared to die, sir
not_available for you and for Sangala.
not_available Eto'o is right.
not_available Without you, Sangala has no leader.
not_available The people need you.
not_available Thirty seconds.
not_available Eto'o's courage is stronger than your threats.
not_available He's willing to die.
not_available And for that sacrifice, he has my eternal gratitude and the gratitude of the people of Sangala.
not_available Ten seconds.
not_available Time's up.
not_available I just got through to him 15 minutes ago.
not_available He's not answering now.
not_available Then get me someone else at the residence.
not_available It's the F.B.I.
not_available Does the F.B.I.
not_available Know we're here? Tanner.
not_available He's the only one who knew we were grabbing Matobo.
not_available He must've talked.
not_available Sir, we need to go before they get here.
not_available Not without Matobo.
not_available Those walls are two feet thick.
not_available Even if we blow a hole with a shape charge 
not_available they'll kill everyone inside.
not_available I think I found a way.
not_available Yeah? Like what? 
not_available We can gas 'em out.
not_available We don't have anything.
not_available We'll find something.
not_available There's a ventilation system running straight into the safe room.
not_available If I can feed the gas through that, it'll flush 'em out.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Is coming.
not_available They won't be here for at least 15 minutes.
not_available What are you talking about? How do you know? If they knew anything before we got here, they'd have evacuated Matobo.
not_available That's just guesswork.
not_available The tac teams are staged out of the D.C.
not_available Branch office.
not_available That's 21 miles from here.
not_available With traffic, that gives us at least 15 minutes.
not_available We're not leaving without Matobo.
not_available That's what Dubaku's paying us for.
not_available You're not seriously considering
not_available Shut up! What kind of gas are you talking about? Ammonium distearate.
not_available We can make it from basic household products.
not_available Do it.
not_available Tony, give me a hand.
not_available Jack, you know ammonium distearate could kill 'em as easily as flush 'em out.
not_available That's a chance we're gonna have to take.
not_available Delivering Matobo's our only chance to get to Dubaku and the C.I.P.
not_available Device.
not_available I got it.
not_available Grab those bowls.
not_available Gotten into the vent yet? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available The F.B.I.
not_available Will be here any minute.
not_available Mr.
not_available Matobo.
not_available We've accessed the air intake to your safe room.
not_available We're now feeding in ammonium distearate gas.
not_available If you do not open the door, you will die.
not_available I believe that you are willing to sacrifice your life.
not_available But are you also willing to sentence your wife to death? Ule.
not_available You know what they will do if we open the door.
not_available I know.
not_available I cannot let them force me to name names.
not_available Our cause is more important than we are.
not_available Take my hand.
not_available Take my hand.
not_available Ule.
not_available Janis Gold? 
not_available Yes? I'm Raymond Howell from the Attorney General's office.
not_available Is there someplace we can talk? 
not_available About? What happened at the hospital, Ms.
not_available Gold.
not_available Agent Walker's being accused of torturing your suspect.
not_available He's not my suspect.
not_available I have no idea what happened after I left that room.
not_available I am not involved.
not_available Suspect's attorneys claim that you sent them to the wrong hospital room to buy Agent Walker more time.
not_available So it sounds to me like you were involved.
not_available This is gonna have to wait.
not_available Janis, I need you on comm now.
not_available Agent Moss, the A.G.
not_available Personally initiated this investigation.
not_available Howell, open your eyes.
not_available We have a situation.
not_available She cannot deal with this right now.
not_available Please, have a seat.
not_available Come here.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available We think Almeida and his crew may already be at Matobo's and we can't reach Renee to warn her.
not_available Why can't you reach her? 
not_available When I heard what she did to Tanner I ordered her back to headquarters to talk to the A.G.
not_available Office.
not_available And she, uh, refused, turned off her cell.
not_available Oh.
not_available I need you running point on SWAT.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hillinger, keep trying to reach Renee.
not_available We're running outta time.
not_available Put more gas in! 
not_available If we do, it'll kill 'em instantly.
not_available How much time is it gonna take, Jack? It's up to them.
not_available I can't breathe.
not_available Just close your eyes and let it happen.
not_available You know if we open that door, it will be worse.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I love you.
not_available Alama, no! Get him out of there! Get the woman too.
not_available Now just breathe.
not_available You'll be all right.
not_available Just breathe.
not_available Okay, let's go! Je suis désolé, Ule.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Let's go.
not_available It's Moss.
not_available Larry, it's Renee.
not_available Renee, listen.
not_available Bauer and Almeida may already be at Matobo's.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They are.
not_available I've got a visual on them loading Matobo and his wife into a truck.
not_available Where the hell is SWAT? 
not_available How long for SWAT? They're still about five minutes out.
not_available Renee, listen to me.
not_available I want you to stand down and fall back until they get there.
not_available Do you hear me? Let me just get a plate on the vehicle.
not_available Drop the gun.
not_available Renee? 
not_available Renee! Damn it! Janis, try gettin' her back.
not_available Whose SWAT team will be first on scene? 
not_available Remick's.
not_available Get him for me now.
not_available Move! Mr.
not_available Emerson! Far as I can tell, she's alone.
not_available Damn you, Bauer, you son of a bitch.
not_available She's F.B.I.
not_available Her name is Walker.
not_available She's the one who pulled me out of the Senate hearing to help 'em find Tony.
not_available Don't be stupid.
not_available What are you talking about? How much does Tanner know about your operation? 
not_available Enough to cause problems.
not_available We need to find out from her what he told the F.B.I.
not_available Till then, we do nothing.
not_available He's right, David.
not_available We need to make sure nothing else has been compromised.
not_available Get her in the cage.
not_available Don't you touch me.
not_available Get your hands off of me.
not_available Shut up, or I will shut you up.
not_available She's clean.
not_available Let's go.
not_available You have Matobo? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available A nd the wife.
not_available But we ran into a complication.
not_available A complication? F.B.I.
not_available Knew about the operation, which means Tanner talked.
not_available I don't like this.
not_available No.
not_available Neither do I.
not_available We got one of their agents with us.
not_available Her name's Walker.
not_available I need you to check with your source at the Bureau.
not_available Find out how much she knows.
not_available All right.
not_available If your source doesn't come up with anything 
not_available then we'll interrogate her when we get there.
not_available Can't believe I trusted you.
not_available You lying son of a bitch.
not_available This is important, lan
not_available to him and me.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Appreciate it.
not_available Any luck? Yes, sir.
not_available Sorry it took so long.
not_available But I tracked down a friend who does crypto for the private sector.
not_available Says he should be able to crack the files on the thumb drive provided the, uh, encryption isn't military grade or better.
not_available I doubt Roger would have had access to anything like that.
not_available He also said you'd have a lot easier job if you just went to the N.S.A.
not_available Not until we know how badly my wife's administration's been compromised.
not_available My friend said he'd meet us at his apartment in 20 minutes.
not_available Do you trust him? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Samantha says the documents will prove my son was murdered.
not_available I'll make sure he understands this can't go anywhere.
not_available Thank you, Brian.
not_available You don't know what it's been like.
not_available All this time, knowing in my bones Roger didn't commit suicide and having people just tolerate me telling me it was my grief talking.
not_available I'm gonna find the people who did this to my son, Brian and I'm gonna make them pay.
not_available Sir, if I may.
not_available What is it? Shouldn't you at least tell the president what you're doing? 
not_available I can't take this to my wife until I can prove it.
not_available You wanted to see me? One thing I've learned
not_available presidents don't make new friends.
not_available That's why they lean on their old ones.
not_available I'll need your support, Ethan.
not_available I'm going to authorize the military operation in Sangala as planned.
not_available Madam President
not_available You don't need to list the consequences, Ethan.
not_available Any action I take in West Africa will likely result in a terrorist attack here.
not_available But if I take no action, an entire generation of Sangalans will be wiped out.
not_available Your critics will point out you took an oath to protect the people of this country.
not_available And the way to do that is not give in to blackmail and threats.
not_available Ethan, taking a stand against the genocide in Sangala has reestablished our leadership and our moral authority in the eyes of the world.
not_available I cannot and I will not back down.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Madam President, Secretary of State Stevens is here to see you.
not_available It's urgent.
not_available Send him in.
not_available What is it, Joe? The F.B.I.
not_available Just reported that Prime Minister Matobo and his wife were abducted from their residence.
not_available What? Abducted by whom? His bodyguards identified Jack Bauer and Tony Almeida as two of the men involved which means Dubaku has the C.I.
not_available P device and Matobo.
not_available Where's the F.B.I.
not_available On finding him? Do they have any active leads? 
not_available Not yet, Madam President.
not_available They're just beginning the search operation.
not_available I think we need to talk about how Matobo's abduction affects the invasion.
not_available Matobo's the only man with enough popular support and strength to lead Sangala after an invasion.
not_available Without him, the country would collapse in complete bloodshed and chaos.
not_available Which means the best course of action may be to meet Dubaku's demand and withdraw our forces.
not_available The best course of action is to find Matobo and the people who took him.
not_available And make sure the F.B.I.
not_available Brings in every relevant agency.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available So, where do we stand with your decision to go through with the invasion? 
not_available We still have 30 minutes before Dubaku's deadline.
not_available I want Matobo found by then.
not_available I just sent you new search coordinates.
not_available Upload a grid to the ground teams, please.
not_available I already did.
not_available They're adjusting their perimeter now.
not_available All right, thanks.
not_available Listen, Erika.
not_available What? I'm sorry I was a jerk before.
not_available You're worried about your wife on a plane.
not_available It's cool.
not_available She's on the ground now.
not_available The plane landed.
not_available She got lucky.
not_available That's great news.
not_available I'm glad she's okay.
not_available Hey, Sean, I can't stop thinking about last night.
not_available Yeah, me too.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Sean, I need you to babysit the downloads on my computer.
not_available They're coming in from the forensics team at Matobo's residence.
not_available Now, please.
not_available Okay.
not_available Sure.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Remick's team just finished a sweep of the Matobo residence.
not_available He's on line two, if you want to talk to him.
not_available Janis, wait.
not_available Did you find Renee? 
not_available No, sir.
not_available But one of Matobo's bodyguards saw her being taken by Bauer and Almeida.
not_available Then she's alive.
not_available She's with the Matobos.
not_available We'll run a trace on her cell.
not_available Can't do that, sir.
not_available We recovered Agent Walker's phone and weapon on site.
not_available Forensics is still sweeping the scene.
not_available I want to be the first to know if they find something.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available All right, um get Renee's picture and description out to all agencies.
not_available And put me in the queue for real
not_available time update from Homeland.
not_available Okay.
not_available Janis.
not_available I want everybody in this office to make finding her their top priority.
not_available Is that understood? 
not_available It is.
not_available Are you gonna be okay? 
not_available What are you talking about? Just get to work.
not_available I'm sorry I couldn't protect you, sir.
not_available You have nothing to apologize for.
not_available How much are they paying you, Jack? I hope it's enough to live with yourself when they kill innocent Americans with the C.I.
not_available P device.
not_available Shut up.
not_available How many people are gonna die because of what you're doing? 
not_available Emerson.
not_available You were right.
not_available Agent Walker broke Tanner.
not_available How much did Tanner spill? 
not_available Other than the details of Matobo's abduction, nothing.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Positive.
not_available Walker is extraneous.
not_available Kill her before you get here.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll be with you soon.
not_available And be quick about it.
not_available Dubaku's anxious to get his hands on the prime minister.
not_available Nichols checked with his source at the Bureau.
not_available Walker doesn't know anything that could compromise the operation.
not_available You trust Nichols's source? 
not_available Nichols does.
not_available That's good enough for me.
not_available Litvak, change of plan.
not_available Take a right on Morrison Avenue.
not_available Got it.
not_available What's on Morrison? Abandoned construction site.
not_available We'll dump her there.
not_available Shouldn't we find out for ourselves what she knows? Nichols wants her out of the way before we deliver Matobo.
not_available I understand your deployment's stretched thin, but one of our own agents is missing.
not_available That's a priority too.
not_available We don't have enough personnel.
not_available Look, I don't care where you find the men.
not_available Just get 'em out there looking.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Never seen him like that.
not_available He looks like his head's gonna explode.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Well, I'm not surprised.
not_available Meaning? 
not_available Meaning it's fairly obvious he has feelings for Renee.
not_available Why do you think that? 
not_available Instinct.
not_available I just know.
not_available Stay on task.
not_available Mais oui, mon général.
not_available Non.
not_available Je comprends.
not_available Oui, mon général.
not_available Je comprends.
not_available Je comprends.
not_available GeneralJuma says the American carrier troop still has not begun to withdraw.
not_available Well, they haven't launched their invasion either.
not_available I gave this president a deadline, and it's almost passed.
not_available Apparently our demonstration was not convincing enough.
not_available This woman is more stubborn than we expected.
not_available Once she realizes we have Matobo, she'll change her mind.
not_available And if she doesn't? You have the C.I.
not_available P module.
not_available Launch another attack.
not_available Let's see how stubborn she is after American civilians start dying.
not_available When will Matobo be here? 
not_available Within an hour.
not_available What caused the delay? 
not_available An F.B.I.
not_available Agent got in the way.
not_available I needed to make sure she hadn't compromised our operation.
not_available And has she? 
not_available No.
not_available As soon as my men get rid of her I'll pick up Matobo personally and bring him to you.
not_available This friend of yours
not_available you sure he's gonna have everything he needs to access the files? He said he didn't think it would be a problem.
not_available Thank you, Brian, for all your help and your loyalty.
not_available You don't need to thank me, sir.
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available You're risking a lot to do this, especially after what happened this morning.
not_available You can thank me after we confirm the information's on that drive.
not_available Said the key should be under the mat.
not_available There it is.
not_available When will your friend be here? He should be here any minute.
not_available Would you mind turning on the air? Really hot here.
not_available Of course.
not_available It's Samantha and Roger.
not_available This is Samantha's apartment, sir.
not_available You.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available Why? Roger was looking into things he shouldn't have.
not_available I tried to protect him too, but
not_available but he wouldn't let me.
not_available He inherited your determination.
not_available You killed my son.
not_available You
not_available Killed Roger.
not_available It's tetradiazene, sir.
not_available It's a neuromuscular paralytic.
not_available Don't try to speak.
not_available The tetradiazene also paralyzes your vocal chords.
not_available If it's any consolation, sir, Roger died quickly.
not_available And I'm gonna make sure you do too.
not_available Situation here is in control.
not_available Are you tracking Ms.
not_available Roth? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Time to get her back to her apartment.
not_available Are you sure this is gonna work? 
not_available It'll work fine.
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor came to her apartment to confront her about Roger Iost his temper, killed her, took his own life.
not_available Okay? All right.
not_available I'll let you know if there are any problems.
not_available I really am sorry, sir.
not_available If only you'd left well enough alone.
not_available Ms.
not_available Roth.
not_available Agent Vossler? Henry Taylor sent me.
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor's been looking into the matter you discussed.
not_available He believes you're in imminent danger.
not_available My God.
not_available What am I supposed to do? He wants me to place you in protective custody, escort you to a safe house.
not_available Now? 
not_available My orders are to take you there immediately.
not_available We can stop at your apartment first.
not_available You can pack clothes, essentials.
not_available Uh, I just need to call my office.
not_available Not until we get you locked down, ma'am.
not_available Please.
not_available Okay.
not_available Right this way.
not_available So it looks like your friend from the A.G.
not_available Is still here.
not_available I know.
not_available What's goin'on? He wants to talk to me about what Renee did to Tanner in the hospital.
not_available What did Renee do to Tanner at the hospital? I don't know, but Howell's claiming she tortured Tanner.
not_available Renee? I don't believe that.
not_available Maybe you should.
not_available Tanner wasn't talking.
not_available Then she kicked me out of the room and then the next thing I know, the alarm on his ventilator's going off.
not_available And Renee had the information she needed.
not_available Mm
not_available hmm.
not_available If you weren't in the room, you don't have a problem.
not_available I do actually.
not_available She asked me to stall his lawyers.
not_available And you did? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Come on, Gold.
not_available What were you thinking? 
not_available She gave me a direct order.
not_available What was I supposed to do? 
not_available Say no.
not_available Do you realize, if they prove that Renee tortured him, you're an accessory? 
not_available And Larry is not gonna protect you.
not_available I know.
not_available Let's just hope the A.G.
not_available Will have moved on to something else when this is all over.
not_available I'm gettin' back to work.
not_available Agent Moss.
not_available What do you want? Forgive my interruption, but it's just been brought to my attention that Agent Walker is missing.
not_available Yes.
not_available She may have been abducted by the same people who are responsible for kidnapping Matobo and his wife.
not_available Very sorry to hear that.
not_available And I want you to know that I appreciate the enormous pressure 
not_available that you and the bureau are Under.
not_available Glad to hear it.
not_available Nevertheless, the Attorney General is still pressing for a full account of Agent Walker's handling of the Tanner interrogation.
not_available And at this moment, Janis Gold is the only witness available to me.
not_available She's not available to you.
not_available I already told you, she can't be spared right now.
not_available I only need a short time with her.
not_available Can't have her.
not_available Are you gonna force me to get the A.G.
not_available On the line? 
not_available You've got to be kidding me.
not_available You really want to press this right now? 
not_available We're in the middle of an international crisis.
not_available I'm aware of that.
not_available And all you seem interested in is condemning the actions of an agent who's in God knows what danger just so you can nail her to the wall.
not_available If Agent Walker broke federal guidelines and used illegal tactics to get information then, yes, she will be prosecuted.
not_available Then maybe you can let us get her back first before you throw her to the wolves.
not_available I mean, if that's okay with you.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Larry, N.S.A.
not_available Just relayed a call they intercepted to us.
not_available Renee was referenced.
not_available Referenced how? Janis? 
not_available I think you need to come hear it yourself.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available We're not done here.
not_available Agent Moss! Did you source it? 
not_available Five minutes ago.
not_available It's legit.
not_available Check it again.
not_available I already did, twice.
not_available Where's the intercept code? 
not_available Right there, above the decryption algorithm.
not_available They routed it to us on a priority channel.
not_available Were we able to get verbal confirmation? 
not_available It's not gonna change the content of the call, Janis.
not_available I know.
not_available I justl
not_available What's on the N.S.A.
not_available Intercept? You said Renee was referenced.
not_available What's on it? It's only a fragment, but she's referenced, yeah.
not_available Enough to get a G.P.S.
not_available Fix? 
not_available Clip's not even 20 seconds long.
not_available The best we can say is that it's in the Metro area.
not_available Play it.
not_available Emerson.
not_available You were right.
not_available Agent Walker broke Tanner.
not_available How much did Tanner spill? 
not_available Other than the details of Matobo's abduction, nothing.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Walker is extraneous.
not_available Kill her before you get here.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll be with you soon.
not_available Be quick about it.
not_available Dubaku's anxious to get his hands on the prime minister.
not_available When was this call made? 
not_available Ten minutes ago.
not_available Run a trace.
not_available I already did.
not_available Run it again.
not_available Jack.
not_available The ditch.
not_available Kill her.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Tony.
not_available Step down.
not_available Step down.
not_available You could either walk, or I can drag you.
not_available You're really gonna kill me.
not_available I'm not gonna beg for my life, Jack.
not_available So everything that you told me was a lie.
not_available I'm doing what I have to.
not_available I don't expect you to understand.
not_available I understand that you are a traitor and a murderer.
not_available You turn around.
not_available No.
not_available You're gonna have to look at me when you pull that trigger.
not_available I said turn around.
not_available If you trust me, I will get you through this alive.
not_available Get on your knees.
not_available A second there, I didn't think you were gonna do it.
not_available Now bury her.
not_available We're on a timetable.
not_available Can't have anyone finding the body before we're out of the country.
not_available Give him a hand, Tony.

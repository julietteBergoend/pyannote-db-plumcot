
not_available We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.
not_available Where is it? You decide when the pain stops.
not_available Drop your gun or I'll kill him.
not_available Paul, where's the data printout? I hid it.
not_available Is this it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's in code.
not_available I couldn't make any sense out of it.
not_available We need to get it back to CTU.
not_available I appreciate you carrying the ball until Michelle got here.
not_available Why don't you bring everyone up to speed? The man responsible for planning today's attacks, Habib Marwan, has been a longterm employee of McLennan
not_available Forster.
not_available Jack and Paul Raines went to inspect his computer files.
not_available As they were doing so, an EMP bomb was detonated, wiping out the company's database.
not_available We have to assume whoever detonated the EMP wants Jack and Paul eliminated.
not_available Why are we going here? 
not_available Weapons and ammunition.
not_available Get out of here! The next one won't miss.
not_available I'm a federal agent.
not_available Look, we need your help.
not_available Who's after you? It has to do with the terrorist attacks.
not_available I have evidence that I need to get to the authorities.
not_available If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, we'll help you.
not_available It's time.
not_available Jack! 
not_available I'm here.
not_available You safe? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need you to get this to CTU.
not_available It needs to get decoded immediately.
not_available Jack, look out! Paul? Paul! Get me a medic.
not_available It's time for you to go.
not_available Are you ready? Yes, of course.
not_available Proceed as planned.
not_available The President of the United States is on a tight schedule.
not_available We can't be late.
not_available He's bleeding out.
not_available Tell 'em we need two litres of A
not_available positive haemo.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Come on, Paul.
not_available Stay with us.
not_available We're almost there.
not_available Hello.
not_available Audrey, it's me.
not_available Oh, Jack.
not_available Thank God you're all right.
not_available Audrey, I need you to listen to me.
not_available Pauls been shot.
not_available Audrey? Audrey? How bad is it? The medics are working on him.
not_available We'll be there in a few minutes.
not_available Jack, how did this happen? One of the gunmen tried to shoot me.
not_available Paul pushed me out of the way.
not_available He saved my life.
not_available Audrey? I'm here.
not_available I just 
not_available Jack, I don't know what to say.
not_available You don't have to say anything.
not_available Surgeons are standing by.
not_available We're gonna do everything that we have to.
not_available You understand that? 
not_available Yeah, I understand.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available See you in a minute.
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, all the evidence we've gathered confirms that this one man, Habib Marwan, is responsible for everything that's happened today.
not_available The train derailment, my abduction, the sabotage of our nuclear power plants.
not_available Does evidence suggest he is planning more attacks? I'm afraid so.
not_available NSA is reporting a spike in chatter.
not_available They're sifting through the intel now, trying to determine potential targets and time frames.
not_available Trying is not good enough.
not_available The chopper is about to land.
not_available We need to pre
not_available empt further attacks.
not_available I understand, sir.
not_available Our best chance of doing that is by capturing Marwan.
not_available How close are you? 
not_available Jack Bauer recovered a document we believe contains contact data on Marwan's network.
not_available CTU is using it to track Marwan.
not_available And if that fails? 
not_available We just have to hope that it doesn't.
not_available Jim, today's events are continuing to generate an unprecedented level of fear.
not_available I'm not sure the social and civil fabric of this country can withstand another attack.
not_available We need to make provisions.
not_available Provisions? The civil unrest that I believe is inevitable in the event of another strike.
not_available Are you saying we should impose martial law? General Wakefield will meet with you in LA to discuss our options.
not_available When? 
not_available Now.
not_available His plane landed.
not_available He'll be calling you to confirm a secure location.
not_available And, Jim, keep this between us.
not_available Of course, Mr.
not_available President.
not_available He's still falling.
not_available He's losing pressure.
not_available I need ten cc's of adrenaline, no compression.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Paul.
not_available Paul, can you hear me? 
not_available Paul.
not_available We gotta get him to surgery now.
not_available Paul.
not_available Let's go.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Please tell me he's not gonna die.
not_available Come here.
not_available Please.
not_available Jack, tell me.
not_available We don't know.
not_available We just don't know.
not_available Jack, are you OK? 
not_available Yeah, I'm fine.
not_available We pulled a name off the list you sent us.
not_available Who is it? Someone on our watch list.
not_available We had no idea he was with Marwan.
not_available Come on inside.
not_available We'll talk you through it.
not_available You need to stay out here while your husband's prepped for surgery.
not_available Please, can I just talk to him for a second? Paul, hey.
not_available Hey, it's Audrey.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I just want you to know that I'm here, OK? I'm here.
not_available We need to prep him now.
not_available I will be here when you get out of surgery.
not_available Paul? Get him prepped and ready.
not_available Joseph Fayed, professor at Green University, chemical engineering.
not_available Came to the US in 1985.
not_available We're sending in a tactical team to pick him up.
not_available That's a mistake.
not_available Why? Marwan's vetted his inner circle carefully.
not_available That man'll die before he says anything.
not_available You're probably right, Jack, but what can we do besides arrest Fayed? Send someone in undercover.
not_available They might lead you to Marwan.
not_available We don't have time to put one of our people undercover.
not_available I'm not talking about one of our people.
not_available Dina Araz.
not_available We've granted her son immunity.
not_available We have nothing left to offer her.
not_available Maybe not.
not_available I'll talk to her while you mobilize a tactical team.
not_available If I can't get her to cooperate, send them in.
not_available It's simple 
not_available we either find Marwan, or we will not be able to stop what he's planning next.
not_available Meet them at the hotel, Old River Road, half a kilometer from the base.
not_available When? 
not_available Leave now.
not_available I'll need his flight package, including clearance and identification codes.
not_available You'll have whatever you need.
not_available Is that all you've got? 
not_available For now it is.
not_available Come on, I haven't seen you in two weeks.
not_available Yeah, I've gotta get to the base.
not_available I'm flying tonight.
not_available Damn.
not_available I'm gonna be late as it is.
not_available Oh, look at me.
not_available I'm all wrinkled.
not_available I wouldn't worry about that.
not_available Hello.
not_available I need to talk to John.
not_available It's for you.
not_available What? It's your wife.
not_available But it's your cell phone.
not_available Laurie.
not_available They say they'll kill the children unless you do what they want.
not_available What's going on, Laurie? Who's there? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Listen to me, Laurie.
not_available Whoever's there, you put them on the phone.
not_available Please don't let them hurt the children.
not_available Laurie.
not_available Laurie, put Put your clothes on, John.
not_available Curtis is prepping the tactical teams, which means you have five minutes to do this.
not_available Do you recognize this man? 
not_available No.
not_available He's connected to Marwan.
not_available I don't know him.
not_available I already told the other agent.
not_available Marwan doesn't permit communication between cells.
not_available His name is Joseph Fayed.
not_available He's a professor at Green University.
not_available You know more about him than I do.
not_available He's also our only way to reach Marwan.
not_available We can't do that without your help.
not_available Why should I help you? I've already gotten all I'm going to get for cooperating.
not_available That's not necessarily true.
not_available I know you love your son.
not_available You've already shown me that today.
not_available But unless you help us get to Fayed, that'll be the last time you see him for the rest of your life.
not_available Dessler.
not_available The teams are in place.
not_available All right.
not_available Have them stand by.
not_available Tactical teams are ready.
not_available They can be at Fayed's house in ten minutes.
not_available Let's give him another minute.
not_available I'm offering you freedom.
not_available You and Behrooz will go into a witness protection programme.
not_available You'll be given new names, identities, everything.
not_available This is what you told me you wanted.
not_available I'm offering you a life with your son.
not_available Right now, the only question is which life do you want? We're out of time.
not_available What do you need me to do? I need you to go to Fayed, and tell him that you need to speak to Marwan.
not_available He won't let me through his front door, let alone get near Marwan.
not_available He will when you tell him that you've got a hostage that can help him.
not_available A hostage? Who? Me.
not_available So what's this all about? What are you doing? 
not_available I'm delivering you to someone.
not_available Who? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You don't know who you work for? 
not_available I work for myself.
not_available Somebody's paying you.
not_available I don't ask them who they are, and they don't tell me.
not_available That's how I stay alive.
not_available All right.
not_available It's time.
not_available If you don't cooperate, your family will die.
not_available Do you understand? It's all there.
not_available Get out of here.
not_available Get your things.
not_available We've got a plane to catch.
not_available Increased chatter indicates Marwan is planning another strike.
not_available It is imperative we locate him before he triggers this.
not_available We are mounting an undercover operation to lead us to him through this man.
not_available Joseph Fayed.
not_available We've struck a deal with Dina Araz to work undercover for us and approach Fayed.
not_available Marwan knows we have Araz in custody.
not_available We will use that to our advantage.
not_available Jack will run us through the cover story.
not_available The cover story goes as follows.
not_available An hour ago, I was transporting Araz to the federal detention centre.
not_available My vehicle was attacked by members of a terrorist cell run by Navi Araz at the intersection of Sepulveda and National.
not_available I managed to kill all of the attackers, but during the engagement Dina Araz secured one of the weapons and took me hostage.
not_available She'll take me to Fayed.
not_available He'll take me to Marwan.
not_available Marwan takes the bait, we track you to him.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're gonna search both Jack and Dina, which makes surveillance a problem.
not_available We'll handle this passively.
not_available We'll use satellite parabolics and laser aggregators.
not_available You think Dina Araz'll be able to play this convincingly? She's lived in the United States for five years while part of a terrorist cell.
not_available Yes.
not_available She's an expert at deception.
not_available As long as she doesn't deceive us.
not_available This is our best and only chance at finding Marwan.
not_available No matter how well we fabricate this story, Jack will be in extreme, immediate danger.
not_available We have to be able to move in at the first sign of trouble.
not_available There is zero tolerance for error.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Good luck, everyone.
not_available Curtis, the detainees from McLennan
not_available Forster have been taken to Division.
not_available Run the interrogation.
not_available You got it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Edgar, I want you to call LAPD and Caltrans.
not_available Their logs need to reflect that the ambush took place.
not_available I need an exact time window.
not_available He just finished telling us.
not_available An hour ago.
not_available I didn't know if there was an update.
not_available No, you weren't paying attention.
not_available We can't afford for you to lose focus at a time like this.
not_available I'm sick of people saying I don't know what I'm doing.
not_available Especially people who don't really work here.
not_available Is there a problem with Edgar? His mother was caught in a contamination zone at San Gabriel.
not_available She took her own life.
not_available Up till now he's been handling it well.
not_available It might be catching up with him.
not_available Do you think he can run the comm part of this operation? Based on what just happened? No.
not_available I didn't see Chloe on the active roster.
not_available Yeah, well, Driscoll forced her to resign.
not_available Why? Apparently, Chloe went against Driscoll's orders, sided with Jack.
not_available Turns out Jack was right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hello.
not_available Chloe.
not_available Michelle Dessler.
not_available Are you calling me from Division? I'm back at CTU.
not_available Secretary Heller asked me to take Erin Driscoll's place.
not_available She got fired? That's too bad.
not_available Tell Edgar to upgrade the pattern
not_available recognition software.
not_available He gets overwhelmed.
not_available I'll make sure he takes care of that.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Listen, Chloe, you're better at what you do than anyone I've worked with.
not_available I need you here.
not_available Thank you for saying that, but I've had enough for today.
not_available Chloe, this would be for Jack, not just for CTU.
not_available What are you talking about? He's about to go into a high
not_available risk operation.
not_available We need to mount massive surveillance in little time.
not_available I'm not confident that Edgar can do this on his own.
not_available Well, there's nothing I can do about that.
not_available Chloe, I just need a few hours of your time, and then you can move on.
not_available I just wanna do everything I can to ensure Jack's safety.
not_available Fine.
not_available But it's just for today.
not_available Thank you, Chloe.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Set cars up at the ambush site in case Marwan wants to verify.
not_available Use dead bodies of terrorists from Heller's rescue.
not_available The follow team will stay as close as they can, but you're flying without a net here.
not_available If a hostile decides to take you out without warning, 
not_available there's nothing we can do.
not_available I know.
not_available Audrey's still at the clinic.
not_available There's time if you wanna say goodbye.
not_available She's got a lot on her mind right now.
not_available Jack, she should know what you're about to do.
not_available She's been through enough today.
not_available Look over the time line.
not_available We'll talk through the details.
not_available I'm not doing anything until I see my son.
not_available We don't have time for that right now.
not_available Seeing my son is non
not_available negotiable.
not_available Tony.
not_available Learn every aspect of the cover story.
not_available Your life depends on it.
not_available Don't worry about me.
not_available You can see your son, but only for a minute.
not_available That's all.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Mom.
not_available They wouldn't tell me where you were or if I'd see you again.
not_available We are going to be together.
not_available What? They wouldn't let you come with me.
not_available Everything has changed.
not_available I agreed to do something for them, and they'll let me go with you.
not_available What do they want you to do? 
not_available Help them find Marwan.
not_available It's too dangerous.
not_available Oh, I can handle Marwan.
not_available Please, Mom, no.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Please, Mom.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Araz, it's time.
not_available Is field surveillance in place? 
not_available We have audio.
not_available We should be able to hear inside the house.
not_available That's assuming they get that far.
not_available OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available Why aren't you going through? 
not_available Use a Danziger filter.
not_available You can download it internally if you know what you're doing.
not_available You're in.
not_available Why are you here? 
not_available Michelle asked me to help.
not_available I'll cover your overflow.
not_available I can handle my assignment.
not_available You can't, otherwise Michelle wouldn't have called me in.
not_available Edgar, I meant to tell you before Chloe got here.
not_available I can do my job.
not_available I don't need any help.
not_available I'm not saying you can't, but I'm not taking chances.
not_available I know we got off to a rocky start, but 
not_available Edgar, this isn't a debate.
not_available It's an order.
not_available Brief Chloe so she can run satellite with you.
not_available Jack's approaching the staging area now.
not_available Baron.
not_available Dessler.
not_available We're set on our end.
not_available Teams are in place.
not_available Go in at your discretion.
not_available Roger that.
not_available We'll leave this line open.
not_available We are going in alone? Our agents are conducting audio surveillance.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available Acknowledge that you can hear me.
not_available Copy that.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available I have to make it look like I was injured.
not_available Take my gun.
not_available This has to look as convincing as possible.
not_available Take my gun.
not_available You must know that I want to kill you.
not_available Yes, but you won't because of Behrooz.
not_available Let's go.
not_available They're going in.
not_available We're standing by.
not_available What if Fayed doesn't believe us? 
not_available Then we're both dead.
not_available ..
not_available people were evacuating the San Gabriel Island area.
not_available As you can see here from footage that was shot earlier ..
not_available people tried to evacuate.
not_available Who is it? 
not_available Joseph, it's Dina Araz.
not_available Who? 
not_available Dina Araz.
not_available I'm a friend.
not_available My husband is Navi.
not_available He's been killed.
not_available I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available I need to speak to Marwan.
not_available I don't know any Marwan.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available Go away before I call the police.
not_available You won't call the police, and we both know why.
not_available What do you want? 
not_available I have a hostage.
not_available Someone Marwan will want.
not_available His name is Jack Bauer, he's a CTU agent.
not_available Now, please let me in before someone sees me.
not_available Close the door.
not_available Put your gun over there.
not_available Do it.
not_available How did you find me? 
not_available My husband told me.
not_available I don't know your husband.
not_available He knew you.
not_available Tell me what happened.
not_available My husband was killed, and I was arrested.
not_available They were transporting me to CTU.
not_available I heard an explosion, and the van we were driving crashed.
not_available It was our people.
not_available They came to rescue me.
not_available Everyone fell, except Bauer and me.
not_available He was wounded, and I managed to get his gun.
not_available Where? 
not_available The intersection of Sepulveda and National.
not_available Half a mile from here.
not_available Don't move.
not_available What is it? 
not_available This is Fayed.
not_available A woman named Dina Araz came to me.
not_available How did she find you? 
not_available She claims her husband told her.
not_available What does she want? 
not_available She has a hostage.
not_available A CTU agent named Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack Bauer? Can you break into the other side? 
not_available No, the signals scrambled.
not_available Our people ambushed a vehicle at the intersection of Sepulveda and National.
not_available Everyone was killed, but she escaped with Bauer.
not_available What do you want me to do? Bring them to me.
not_available I will call you back in five minutes with the details.
not_available Be ready.
not_available Do you understand? 
not_available Yes.
not_available I understand.
not_available Marwan wants to see him.
not_available Baron, it's a go.
not_available I heard.
not_available Set a follow grid.
not_available We'll coordinate from our end.
not_available Evening, sir.
not_available Evening.
not_available Pop the trunk for me, sir.
not_available Since when are you searching officers' cars at the gate? Elevated threat level.
not_available OK.
not_available You're good to go, sir.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm on base.
not_available Proceed as planned.
not_available Let me talk to my family.
not_available Open the trunk.
not_available Let me talk to my wife.
not_available I said open the trunk.
not_available Please.
not_available Let me talk to my family.
not_available Your family is dead.
not_available And so are you.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Raines.
not_available Your husband sustained bullet wounds to his chest and abdomen.
not_available We extracted one bullet, but I called a neurosurgeon in from Cedars 
not_available to help extract the second bullet.
not_available Why a neurosurgeon? Well, the bullet is lodged against his T5 vertebra, and we want to avoid any further spinal trauma.
not_available I can't believe this is happening.
not_available I'II let you know as soon as I get any news.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Dad I don't think I realized how much I care for Paul until now.
not_available I know this is terrible timing, but the president has called and I have to leave.
not_available You'll be able to reach me on my number.
not_available The doctors will keep me up to speed here.
not_available OK.
not_available I love you, Audrey.
not_available And I'm proud to be your dad.
not_available I love you, too.
not_available Be careful.
not_available Where are you taking me? 
not_available Shut up.
not_available How far are we going? It won't be long.
not_available You look nervous.
not_available What do you expect? I wouldn't have contacted you if I felt I had a choice.
not_available And as a result, I have no choice.
not_available We do whatever we have to for the cause.
not_available So what's the problem? There is no problem.
not_available They're turning off Olympic.
not_available Moving to the next subchannel.
not_available He's turning onto a side street.
not_available Collier Avenue.
not_available Hold that distance.
not_available Understood.
not_available He's heading towards the Broad Street tunnel.
not_available He's slowing down.
not_available Baron, drop back.
not_available We can't have him spot the tail.
not_available We're backing off.
not_available He's turning into the tunnel.
not_available Maintain your distance.
not_available He's too far ahead.
not_available We won't be able to hear what's going on.
not_available The tunnel is 400 yards long.
not_available They'll be out of view for 20 seconds.
not_available Pull in front of this truck.
not_available What's going on? 
not_available Get out of the car.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available From Marwan.
not_available Yes.
not_available This is taking too long.
not_available They're outta the tunnel.
not_available Do you have a visual? That's it.
not_available We got him up ahead.
not_available Fayed's turning onto Napier.
not_available Napier loops back around to Olympic.
not_available He just spent the last five minutes driving in a circle.
not_available Maybe he's trying to detect surveillance.
not_available Chloe, can you switch to infrared? 
not_available Hold on.
not_available There's only one person in the car.
not_available They made a switch in the tunnel.
not_available The covert part of the operation is over.
not_available All teams, move in on the target car.
not_available Alpha team, cut him off at the bridge.
not_available Establish a perimeter.
not_available Stop and search all vehicles.
not_available Anything on satellite? 
not_available Nothing around the immediate area.
not_available Can you go back into archives? 
not_available It'll take a few minutes.
not_available Do it.
not_available Baron, what's your status? We're closing in now.
not_available We got him surrounded on the bridge.
not_available I'll take the lead.
not_available Passenger side.
not_available On the left.
not_available Flank him.
not_available Get out of the car, and put your hands up.
not_available Out of the car! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Oh, my God.
not_available Marwan set us up.
not_available Almeida.
not_available This is Alden.
not_available Baron's dead.
not_available So is Fayed.
not_available Is there any sign of Jack? 
not_available No.
not_available Any other hostiles in the area? 
not_available No, the area looks secure.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll get you another backup team as soon as I can.
not_available I have the archive satellite footage.
not_available Play it back.
not_available OK.
not_available During the time Fayed's car is in the tunnel, three vehicles exit.
not_available Check the van.
not_available Can you get me a license number on that? Not from the satellite.
not_available I'll check the traffic cameras.
not_available Get me the Caltrans interface.
not_available We have a socket open.
not_available Logging in.
not_available Done.
not_available OK, there's a camera at the entrance to the tunnel.
not_available Looking for the right frame.
not_available Got it.
not_available Send this out to all field teams.
not_available I want support setting up the grid.
not_available I'm on it.
not_available We have an ID on a vehicle.
not_available White Chevy van, late '90s, license plate 
not_available Charlie Victor Alpha 322.
not_available Get up.
not_available You've caused me a lot of trouble.
not_available Sorry for your loss, Dina.
not_available Navi was a great man.
not_available I hope my men weren't too rough with you.
not_available It was necessary, in case you were under surveillance.
not_available I understand.
not_available But we weren't followed.
not_available I was careful.
not_available You're a good liar, Dina.
not_available What? Fayed martyred himself.
not_available The men who were following you are dead.
not_available What men? 
not_available Enough with the lies.
not_available Marwan, please believe me.
not_available I did not betray you.
not_available Prove it to me.
not_available Kill him.
not_available Just what I thought.
not_available Get him out of here.

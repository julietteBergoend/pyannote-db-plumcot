not_available Previously on 24.
not_available You son of a bitch.
not_available You're behind my son's death.
not_available Madam President, I have your husband.
not_available You will have your forces withdrawn from around my country, Sangala immediately and permanently or your husband will die a slow and certain death.
not_available I just wanted to make sure that you were still coming to dinner tonight.
not_available Marika, I can't.
not_available I'll make it up to you.
not_available If you're looking for Marika, she's not with me.
not_available I'm looking for you, Samuel, or whatever your real name is.
not_available Now, I don't know who you really are and I don't care.
not_available I just want you out of my sister's life.
not_available Keep an incident quiet until whatJack and I are doing goes down.
not_available What incident? 
not_available Vossler's dead.
not_available Jack killed him at the hotel on 18th and Reagan.
not_available It was self
not_available defense.
not_available Damn it, Renee.
not_available What the hell are you doing with this guy? We're supposed to bring suspects in, not murder them.
not_available Until we know who Dubaku's source is, you've got to handle this outside of the Bureau.
not_available Dubaku is the only person with the names of the people who betrayed you within your government.
not_available It's imperative that we find him.
not_available You resigned from government service and the Senate regards you as having been a renegade agent.
not_available How am I supposed to know where your loyalties really lie? With all due respect, Madam President, ask around.
not_available I got an address for Henry Taylor.
not_available Get an ambulance! 
not_available The following takes place between 4:00 p.m.
not_available And 5:00 p.m.
not_available No one else gets through here.
not_available Follow me.
not_available It's Henry Taylor, the president's husband.
not_available But that information is not to be disseminated.
not_available Clear? 
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available L
not_available Mr.
not_available Taylor, don't speak.
not_available I need you to save your energy.
not_available Over here! Excuse me.
not_available Step back, please! This is Unit Six.
not_available We got a gunshot trauma to the chest.
not_available Nine
not_available millimeter round.
not_available Nine
not_available millimeter, substernal.
not_available Pulse is rapid.
not_available You okay? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm gonna call the president.
not_available I want you to search all the rooms.
not_available See if you can get anything off their hardware that's gonna tell us where Dubaku went.
not_available President Taylor's office.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available I need to speak with the president.
not_available One moment, please.
not_available Madam President, I would encourage you not to lose hope.
not_available Dubaku knows that we tried to deceive him, Ethan.
not_available He has no reason to keep Henry alive.
not_available Madam President, Jack Bauer's on line one.
not_available Put him through.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, this is President Taylor.
not_available Madam President, we have your husband.
not_available He's alive, but he sustained a gunshot wound to the chest.
not_available How bad is it? E.M.T.
not_available Are stabilizing him.
not_available They're getting ready to transfer him to West Arlington Hospital.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bauer, be more specific.
not_available Is my husband going to be okay? We're not gonna know anything until the doctors see him.
not_available Ma'am, I have to warn you.
not_available He has lost a lot ofblood.
not_available Jack, it's Bill.
not_available Do you have Dubaku? Negative.
not_available He was gone before we got here.
not_available Madam President, since your husband was the only leverage that Dubaku had left it's safe to say that he's trying to leave the country now.
not_available Have you any idea how he intends to do that? Not at this time.
not_available Unfortunately, all his men were killed during the assault.
not_available Agent Walker and I will stay behind.
not_available We'll continue to search the area.
not_available We have to assume that Dubaku has an exit strategy already in place.
not_available Whatever we're gonna do to find him, we're gonna have to do it fast.
not_available Yes.
not_available Thank you, Mr.
not_available Bauer.
not_available Please keep me apprised on everything.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I am so sorry, Madam President.
not_available Ethan, I'm going to the hospital to be with my husband.
not_available Ma'am, that's not possible.
not_available You're executing a military invasion.
not_available My generals can execute it perfectly well without me.
not_available We can't ignore the fact the Secret Service has been compromised.
not_available There's no way we can ensure your safety outside the White House.
not_available I don't give a damn.
not_available I am not gonna be held prisoner in this office while my husband is fighting for his life.
not_available Now either find someone to take me to the hospital, or I'll drive there myself.
not_available Madam President, you know my record of service.
not_available If it's acceptable to you, I'm willing to assume responsibility for your security.
not_available Bill, you're no longer credentialed.
not_available You don't have the authority.
not_available Until we capture Dubaku and interrogate him we have no idea who in the government is working for him.
not_available You do not know who you can trust.
not_available But I can trust you? I brought this conspiracy to your attention, Madam President.
not_available I would hope that I've earned it.
not_available What do you need from me? Reinstate my government clearance allow me the authority to vet White House staff and allow me to bring one of my own people into F.B.
not_available I to provide Larry Moss with tactical support.
not_available Who is it that you want to bring in? 
not_available Chloe O'Brian.
not_available I can vouch for her.
not_available She's the best there is.
not_available Her clearances were also revoked when C.T.U.
not_available Was decommissioned.
not_available Isn't there anyone capable of handling these duties without our having to reinstate her? Someone in the Bureau is on Dubaku's payroll.
not_available Until we find out who it is Larry Moss can't take the chance of bringing his own people into a manhunt for Dubaku.
not_available All right.
not_available The director of White House Secret Service operations is Agent Hovis.
not_available I'll order him to turn over security protocols to you.
not_available I know Ted Hovis, Madam President.
not_available He's not gonna like this.
not_available He's gonna fight us.
not_available Considering that agents under his charge are responsible for what happened to my husband I don't give a damn what he likes.
not_available You have your provisional appointment, Mr.
not_available Buchanan, under the authority of this office.
not_available Thank you, Madam President.
not_available You can thank me by getting me to the hospital.
not_available I'll make the arrangements.
not_available Madam President
not_available Your concerns are clear to me, but I've made my decision.
not_available I'm only trying to do my job, looking out for your interests.
not_available My interest right now is catching Iké Dubaku.
not_available He has killed scores of Americans today he tried to kill my husband, and he has corrupted our government.
not_available Whatever it takes, I want that son of a bitch found.
not_available Marika! Marika! Samuel? What are you doing here? 
not_available We need to talk.
not_available Uh, okay.
not_available Well, I get a break in 20 minutes.
not_available No, now.
not_available Come.
not_available What is it? You're scaring me.
not_available Uh, something has come up.
not_available I need to leave the country.
not_available What? When? 
not_available Right away.
not_available I don't understand.
not_available When are you coming back? Marika, listen to me.
not_available I haven't been entirely honest with you.
not_available My passport visa expired a couple of months ago, and I've been in the country illegally.
not_available I'm afraid the Immigration people have caught up with me.
not_available It was my sister, wasn't it? She reported you, didn't she? 
not_available That doesn't matter now.
not_available What is important is, I have to leave the country tonight and I want you to come with me.
not_available Tonight? 
not_available Marika, we've talked about this.
not_available I promised that one day I would take you away from here, give you the happiness you deserve.
not_available Samuel, I want that too, but
not_available but not tonight, not so soon.
not_available Marika! Marika, I don't have time to argue with you! I'm sorry.
not_available I can't leave Rosa.
not_available I mean, she needs me.
not_available I'm the only one she has to take care of her.
not_available You know that.
not_available I know.
not_available I know.
not_available Which is why she's going to join us.
not_available Join us? As soon as possible.
not_available I could only arrange tickets for both of us tonight.
not_available But I want you to promise not to tell your sister of our plans, at least not yet.
not_available I have to.
not_available I can't just run off.
not_available No.
not_available No, no.
not_available She might cause trouble for us, make it impossible for us to leave.
not_available Look, I promise you your sister will join us within a couple of days of our arrival.
not_available Okay? 
not_available Our arrival where? Belize.
not_available I have shown you the photographs of my home there.
not_available Do you love me? You know I do.
not_available Then trust me.
not_available Say you'll come.
not_available I'll get my things.
not_available Now, I still need to finalize our arrangements.
not_available I want you to go home and pack.
not_available Wait for my call.
not_available All right.
not_available Yes? It's me.
not_available Have you made the preparations? Almost.
not_available It's been tricky clearing a flight corridor since F.A.A.
not_available Still has most private and commercial aircraft grounded.
not_available I have faith you'll manage.
not_available The arrangements are for two passengers.
not_available Just as you requested.
not_available Are you sure you want to leave now, Colonel? Can't imagine GeneralJuma will be pleased to learn that you're abandoning your mission.
not_available Mission is over.
not_available I have done what I can do.
not_available If that is not enough forJuma, then to hell with him.
not_available Got your passports and itinerary in hand.
not_available We meet at our usual spot in half an hour.
not_available I'll bring them.
not_available No.
not_available We meet in the lobby of the Roosevelt Continental Hotel.
not_available That's not a good idea.
not_available It'll be crowded there at this hour.
not_available I know.
not_available I want to make it earlier.
not_available I'll see you in 15 minutes.
not_available Go.
not_available Can't get it to boot.
not_available Hard drive must be fried.
not_available Let's search the bodies.
not_available Start with him.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Renee, it's me.
not_available Bill Buchanan just briefed me on your situation.
not_available What's Henry Taylor's status? We got him in an ambulance en route to West Arlington Hospital.
not_available I don't know his current condition.
not_available Buchanan told me you and Bauer were in a firefight.
not_available Yeah.
not_available We took down six of Dubaku's men, but Dubaku was gone before we got there.
not_available You all right? 
not_available Been in worse.
not_available You sure? 
not_available I'm fine, Larry.
not_available Really? I'm not so sure about that.
not_available And what is that supposed to mean? I'm looking at a report faxed to me from Metro Police.
not_available A Mrs.
not_available Carol Vossler is claiming an unidentified woman held her and her child hostage at gunpoint.
not_available She says the woman threatened to kill her son.
not_available Larry, we discussed this.
not_available We needed to get Vossler to tell us where Taylor was being held.
not_available It was the only leverage we had.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Right.
not_available Whatever's necessary.
not_available Jack Bauer's rationalization for every unethical action he takes.
not_available Well, it worked, Larry.
not_available Doesn't that count for something? Renee, Jack Bauer is about to be strung up by a Senate subcommittee and you are following his playbook.
not_available You got the A.G.
not_available Office looking into that thing you pulled with Tanner's respirator.
not_available And now this.
not_available No one was actually hurt.
not_available No one
not_available Renee, Bauer killed the woman's husband! Renee, I swear to you here I am scared of what is happening to you.
not_available You put these people through hell, and it doesn't bother you.
not_available I didn't say that it doesn't bother me, Larry.
not_available I said that it worked.
not_available Of course it bothers me.
not_available I can see that woman's face she and her child staring at me with such
not_available She had no idea that her husband was a killer, a traitor to his country and she looked at me like I was the monster.
not_available Agent Walker.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I cross
not_available referenced the information on these P.D.A.'s.
not_available I came some across banking transactions
not_available all from a series of accounts registered to the same address.
not_available You think it's a safe house? 
not_available It's worth a shot.
not_available Larry, we may have an address on Dubaku.
not_available Apartment 6.
not_available Unit 6.
not_available We're moving out now.
not_available Can you provide sat surveillance? Yeah.
not_available Bill Buchanan's sending somebody over to run tech.
not_available But until she's up and running, you're gonna have to go in blind.
not_available Okay.
not_available We'll be in touch.
not_available You sure you're okay? Fine.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We're back with Lila Lee talking about her wonderful book, Recipes from My Family: A Living Genealogy.
not_available Thank you for coming on the show today.
not_available Oh, it's my pleasure, Pam.
not_available I mean, it has been quite a journey to this moment.
not_available I had no idea that what I started would end up here.
not_available You were telling us earlier that this just started as gathering recipes and traditions that you remembered when you were growing up.
not_available That's right.
not_available You know, I was trying to tell my children as I would make them lunch, I was reminded of where did this recipe come from.
not_available Then as I did that, I remembered, well, this was my grandmother's
not_available Federal investigations continue into the terrorist acts that have gripped the nation's capital as well as the people of Kidron, Ohio.
not_available Despite assurances by President Taylor 
not_available Hey, sweetie.
not_available That the threat has passed sources at the White House will not confirm that all those responsible have been accounted for.
not_available Now you sure you're not gonna need my help? I'm just running F.B.I.
not_available Ops temporarily until they catch Dubaku.
not_available Once they find him, hopefully he'll tell us the names of all the people on his payroll that are inside our government.
not_available And then we can go home? 
not_available Then we can go home.
not_available Well, just be careful.
not_available All right? Because if Buchanan's right and Dubaku has someone working inside the Bureau
not_available I'll watch my back.
not_available You just watch Prescott.
not_available Hey, sweetheart, Mommy has to go to work.
not_available You be good, okay? Bye, Mommy.
not_available You be good too.
not_available I will.
not_available Bye.
not_available And if you get all jammed up, you know where to find me.
not_available I.D., please.
not_available Chloe O'Brian.
not_available All right, go ahead.
not_available Need you to cross
not_available reference our deployments with Homeland.
not_available Make sure the requisition numbers match up.
not_available After that, you can catch up on the hourlies.
not_available Are you joking? That is busy work, administrative crap you're handing me.
not_available Janis, I don't have the time nor the inclination right now to explain my assignments to you.
not_available Just get it done.
not_available Agent Moss.
not_available Chloe O'Brian just cleared security.
not_available She's on her way up.
not_available All right.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Janis, set up a secure V.P.N.
not_available Socket, port it to the conference room.
not_available Why do you need a V.P.N.
not_available Socket? I'm bringing in a consultant from Homeland to confirm there are no lingering gaps in the C.I.P.
not_available Firewall.
not_available That's fine.
not_available Take that downstairs.
not_available Ms.
not_available O'Brian.
not_available Larry Moss.
not_available Welcome to the F.B.I.
not_available Hi.
not_available You can call me Chloe.
not_available We're right in here.
not_available Buchanan said you'd be up to speed? 
not_available I'm up.
not_available Good.
not_available Agent Walker and Bauer are pursuing a potential lead on Dubaku.
not_available They're en route to this address in the Mount Pleasant district.
not_available Agent Walker's requesting satellite support.
not_available What's the matter? Is something wrong? I'm feeling a little exposed here.
not_available If someone out there is working for Dubaku, shouldn't we be doing this more covertly? As far as anyone knows, you're working on shoring up our firewall.
not_available Besides, this is the only space available where you'll have full access to our server.
not_available Our network doesn't support remote modules.
not_available That's inefficient.
not_available Whoever set your network up that way didn't know what they were doing.
not_available I set our network up that way.
not_available Oh.
not_available Okay.
not_available Something else? You worked with Bauer for a long time, didn't you? Seven years, on and off.
not_available That's impressive.
not_available That you survived the experience.
not_available What are you talking about? 
not_available Only that a lot of people didn't.
not_available Curtis Manning, Ryan Chappelle, his own wife.
not_available Are you saying it's Jack's fault his wife was killed? You tell me.
not_available Jack Bauer is the most trustworthy, honorable man I know, and he's my friend.
not_available Maybe you should worry less about him and more about the mole in your office working for Dubaku.
not_available Is that Chloe O'Brian? What? In the conference room
not_available Chloe O'Brian.
not_available She was senior analyst at C.T.U.
not_available I once took a seminar she gave.
not_available What's she doing here? Larry said Homeland sent her to check for residual breaches from the firewall attack.
not_available Huh.
not_available What? It just doesn't sound like her area of expertise.
not_available Besides, as far as I know, she's been inactive since C.T.U.
not_available Was decommissioned.
not_available Passports and travel itinerary.
not_available Hawker Siddeley 748 is fueling at Taft Airfield.
not_available Be ready to fly within a half hour, get you to the Cayman Islands.
not_available Shouldn't have any trouble getting to Belize from there.
not_available I need a car to the airfield and a driver.
not_available I assumed you had your own transportation.
not_available It's not for me.
not_available I see.
not_available It's for the girl.
not_available Well, I'm not sure I can find someone I trust on such short notice.
not_available Really? What about your man at the bar? 
not_available Excuse me? Or one of the two on the balcony watching us now? Or the two in the black Town Car, waiting for me to leave? Do you think I'm a fool, Mr.
not_available Burnett? I know you people see me as a liability now.
not_available These men are here to guarantee your safety, Colonel, not to threaten it.
not_available Guarantee my safety.
not_available How nice.
not_available And said with such sincerity.
not_available I want you to take this message back with you.
not_available If anything should happen to me on my way out of the countryan accident or an assassination attempt, anythingthe plane that you were so generous to donate decides to explode
not_available a data file with all the names and bank transactions of all those involved will be sent to theJustice Department.
not_available That is completely unnecessary.
not_available Same holds true if anything should happen to Marika Donoso.
not_available I swear to you she knows nothing of this.
not_available She's no threat to you.
not_available Make sure your driver knows this before he brings her to me.
not_available Do you understand what I am saying? I want you to tell me that you understand what I am saying to you, so there will be no mistakes.
not_available I understand.
not_available Good.
not_available The one thing I have learned in the company of mercenaries, Mr.
not_available Burnett is that ultimately they care about nothing but their own survival.
not_available Good day.
not_available I was right.
not_available Dubaku suspected we were gonna take him out.
not_available And apparently he's assembled evidence to use as an insurance policy.
not_available We need to make sure he gets out of the country and safely into exile, otherwise we're all compromised.
not_available I'll make the calls.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Rosa.
not_available Where are you going? Rosa, listen to me.
not_available We're going away from here, all of us.
not_available Well, what do you mean, "all"? Samuel told me the truth.
not_available He's an illegal, just like you thought.
not_available He has to leave the country, and I've agreed to go with him.
not_available You're leaving me? 
not_available No, no.
not_available Only for a short time.
not_available You're gonna come too.
not_available Samuel's made plans.
not_available We're gonna live with him in his home in Belize.
not_available Marika, he's lying to you.
not_available He's not.
not_available I won't let you do this! My God, Rosa! I have taken care of you my entire life! I've sacrificed everything for you.
not_available Why can't you let me have this? 
not_available I don't trust him! Well, you've never liked any man who's ever shown any interest in me.
not_available Every chance I've ever had at happiness, you've found some way of ruining it.
not_available But not this time.
not_available Marika, I'm begging you.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available No.
not_available Marika, please.
not_available Stop.
not_available Move! 
not_available Marika, please.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available I'm begging you, Marik
not_available F.B.I.
not_available Don't move! 
not_available Get on your knees now! On your knees! Both of you, put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers! Now! Do not move! We're clear.
not_available Where is Dubaku? 
not_available Who? Don't play games with me! Iké Dubaku! We traced bank accounts to this address.
not_available Now, where is he? We don't know wh
not_available who you talking about.
not_available Let me try and make this easier for you.
not_available You know this man? No.
not_available You're lying to me.
not_available Why are you lying to me? L
not_available Let me see.
not_available That's him.
not_available We know him.
not_available He calls himself Aboa.
not_available Samuel Aboa.
not_available Rosa, shut up! 
not_available She was going to meet him to leave me.
not_available Where were you gonna meet him? Where were you going? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available How do you know him? You work for him? 
not_available No.
not_available Do you work for him? 
not_available No.
not_available You know what he's doing here in this country? Do you have any idea what this man is? He's everything to me.
not_available Notify C.P.
not_available Iocation.
not_available Will hold.
not_available Once the floor's secure.
not_available Nurse
not_available Mitchell.
not_available Nurse Mitchell, I'd like to see my husband.
not_available Ma'am, I don't know if that's possible.
not_available I was told that Dr.
not_available Schulman will be doing the surgery.
not_available Where is he? Excuse me, Madam President.
not_available I'm Lee Schulman, your husband's surgeon.
not_available If you come with me you can see him now, but you'll need to keep it brief.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You should know Mr.
not_available Taylor's looking at a minimum of five hours in surgery.
not_available The bullet lacerated his pulmonary artery and lodged in his thoracic region.
not_available He's also suffered massive internal bleeding.
not_available Can you offer any kind of prognosis? I'm a blunt woman, Dr.
not_available Schulman.
not_available I appreciate bluntness.
not_available His chances aren't good, ma'am but I'll do everything I can.
not_available If you'll excuse me, I need to scrub up now.
not_available Henry! Darling, can you hear me? 
not_available Ally.
not_available Yes, sweetheart.
not_available I'm here.
not_available I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you about Roger.
not_available You were right.
not_available It wasn't suicide.
not_available I know that now.
not_available You were always right.
not_available He was a hero.
not_available Yes.
not_available He was.
not_available And so are you.
not_available I'm sorry, Madam President, but the anesthesiologist is ready now.
not_available [Woman On P.A.
not_available Mr.
not_available Carlisle, Admitting.
not_available Mr.
not_available Carlisle, come to Admitting, please.
not_available Mr.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available Yes, Madam President? There's something I need you to do for me.
not_available Have someone find my daughter Olivia and bring her to me.
not_available Have you had a chance to tell her? My daughter and I haven't spoken for some time, Mr.
not_available Buchanan.
not_available She'd never get on the phone with me.
not_available She works for a consulting firm
not_available Martlin Norris.
not_available Do you have someone trustworthy you can send? Yes, ma'am.
not_available I believe I do.
not_available And here he is again, in the uniform of the presidential guard at the gates of the notorious Mukatu Prison.
not_available And here, inside the soccer stadium after the Barakar Massacre the event that earned him the nickname the Butcher of Sangala.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available No more.
not_available What did you say his real name was again? Dubaku.
not_available Iké Dubaku.
not_available I've seen firsthand what he's capable of.
not_available I was in Africa a few months ago.
not_available He was responsible for murdering a friend of mine.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I know this is a shock and I'm sorry, I really am.
not_available But here's the situation
not_available we need your help and we need it now.
not_available What kind of help? We need to put this man in custody before he can leave the country.
not_available She already told you she doesn't know where he is.
not_available You said earlier that you were gonna meet him.
not_available Where? He didn't say.
not_available Just told me to go home and pack and wait for his call.
not_available Give me your phone.
not_available Why? 
not_available When he calls, I want you to answer.
not_available No.
not_available No, no.
not_available I can't.
not_available I can't.
not_available Yes, you can.
not_available Listen to me.
not_available Just listen to me.
not_available L
not_available It's over.
not_available The man you thought you knew, the man you had feelings for, he doesn't exist.
not_available All you've been left with are his lies and his betrayal.
not_available Is that him? 
not_available Marika, please.
not_available All I want you to do is answer the phone and talk to him so that we can find out where he wants to meet you.
not_available Please, you can do this.
not_available Please just try.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Marika? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Are you all right? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available What took you so long to answer the phone? I was in the bedroom, packing.
not_available Where are you? What's wrong? You sound strange.
not_available It's
not_available It was Rosa.
not_available She caught me packing and we argued.
not_available Is she going to be a problem for us? 
not_available No! I'm sorry, Samuel.
not_available I had to tell her everything.
not_available It was the only way.
not_available But, uh
not_available But she understands now.
not_available Are you certain? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, she's fine, now that she knows she and I will be together again in a few days.
not_available Hmm.
not_available She should thank heaven she has such an angel for a sister.
not_available Are you ready to go? 
not_available Almost.
not_available Hurry up then.
not_available I've had a car sent for you.
not_available It should be there very shortly.
not_available Go downstairs and wait for it.
not_available Where is it taking me? 
not_available Don't worry.
not_available The driver will know.
not_available I just want the woman I love to get downstairs as quickly as possible.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available You did great.
not_available Did we get the rendezvous point? No.
not_available He's sending a car with a driver.
not_available Come here.
not_available There's no one on the street yet.
not_available We could grab the driver, get him to tell us Dubaku's location.
not_available There's no guarantee we can get him to talk and if we take too long, Dubaku's not gonna wait around.
not_available So then what do we do? We can get her to go meet with him.
not_available What? We could track her.
not_available We could use her cell phone as a transponder.
not_available You want to send that girl to Dubaku? 
not_available We don't have another choice.
not_available Jack.
not_available You want to get Dubaku? This is our shot.
not_available Marika I have a favor to ask of you.
not_available We can't make you do this, but when the car arrives we would like you to go with the driver so that we could follow you back to Dubaku.
not_available What are you talking about? You want her to go to him and face him? It's the only chance we have of finding him before he disappears forever.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available No! I'm your older sister, and I won't allow it! It's not your decision to make, Rosa.
not_available It's mine.
not_available And it's the right thing to do.
not_available Let me see your phone.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available Getting your S.I.D.
not_available Number.
not_available That's how we're gonna track you.
not_available You're not gonna be out there alone.
not_available Agent Walker and I will be following you.
not_available We'll never be more than a mile behind.
not_available As soon as you reach the destination, that's when we'll move in.
not_available Marika, a mile.
not_available Are you crazy? Rosa, enough.
not_available You heard what he said! He's a murderer! He could hurt you! 
not_available He won't.
not_available Rosa, I should've listened to you.
not_available Sweetheart.
not_available You warned me about him.
not_available Listen, the only reason why I said those things was because I was jealous and I didn't want to lose you.
not_available Larry, this is Jack.
not_available Renee said you had someone running operations support? 
not_available Yeah, she's right here.
not_available I'll put you on speaker.
not_available Jack, it's Chloe.
not_available Chloe.
not_available What do you need? How long's it gonna take you to set up a sat beacon for a mobile line? Usually a few seconds, but with the backward way they have this system set up it's gonna take at least a few minutes.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let me give you the S.I.D.
not_available Number: You got it? 
not_available Got it.
not_available Jack, who are you tracking? A woman who's involved with Dubaku.
not_available He's sending a car to take her to him.
not_available She's one of his operatives? 
not_available No.
not_available It's more complicated than that.
not_available Arthur, you're not going to find another firm that's done more high
not_available level consulting work for a relatively small pharmaceutical company like yours.
not_available Remember, my firm helped the governor craft a plan to swap property taxes for sales taxes in his last budget reform.
not_available Tell me that didn't save Dexter Carr a bundle.
not_available Oh, it did, Olivia.
not_available But since I'm specifically looking to hire you, I need to know what you yourself can do.
not_available Whatever you need.
not_available You know my accomplishments.
not_available You've seen my résumé.
not_available I mean White House influence considering your family.
not_available We're not lobbyists, Arthur.
not_available It states that clearly in the contract.
not_available I just thought since you have the president's ear
not_available I don't.
not_available Is that going to be a problem? Excuse me.
not_available Ms.
not_available Taylor? Do I know you? My name is Aaron Pierce.
not_available Your office told me you'd be here.
not_available I've been dispatched at the request of the president.
not_available Your credentials say you've retired, Mr.
not_available Pierce.
not_available Perhaps no one informed you I refused Secret Service protection months ago.
not_available I'm aware of that, ma'am.
not_available This is a special circumstance.
not_available Well, as you can see, I'm a little busy right now.
not_available This isn't a good time.
not_available I'm sorry, but I have to insist.
not_available Really, it's all right.
not_available No.
not_available No, it's not all right.
not_available What is it that's so important for my mother to steal me away while I'm trying to do business? I'm not at liberty to say, ma'am.
not_available That information is confidential.
not_available Olivia, we can pick this up at a later time.
not_available Arthur, wait.
not_available It
not_available We'll be in touch.
not_available Ma'am, please.
not_available I'm not going anywhere with you until you tell me what this is about.
not_available It's your father, Ms.
not_available Taylor.
not_available He's been shot.
not_available He's in surgery at West Arlington Hospital.
not_available Your mother's there now.
not_available None of this is public knowledge.
not_available My God.
not_available L
not_available My car is just outside.
not_available Excuse me, Sean.
not_available Can I please get the digital beta key for the server? Why? Larry asked for it.
not_available Something to do with the firewall assessment.
not_available If Larry wants it, why doesn't he come to me? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe I oughta go ask him.
not_available No.
not_available Okay.
not_available I think that Larry brought in this woman, Chloe O'Brian, to replace me and I just want to get a bead on what they're working on, that's all.
not_available That's all? That's enough to lose us both our jobs.
not_available Well, maybe I should stop covering for you.
not_available What are you talking about? Erika and you and your little sexual indiscretions? I've said nothing to Larry or your wife.
not_available I'm sure you'd like me to keep it that way.
not_available You're a little bitch, you know that? You're a little bitch.
not_available Okay, Jack.
not_available The link's up.
not_available I've got the signal.
not_available Copy that.
not_available I'll get back to you.
not_available We're on.
not_available I'll be all right.
not_available Marika, we gotta go.
not_available Okay.
not_available You.
not_available F.B.I.
not_available You keep her safe, you hear me? We will.
not_available I'm really scared.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available Just remember, we're right behind you.
not_available Hold up here.
not_available Okay.
not_available Now, listen, if you get into trouble, you can signal us by dialing 10
not_available No.
not_available No, I don't want you to do that.
not_available Don't do anything that's gonna raise the suspicion of the driver.
not_available Okay.
not_available You ready? 
not_available I'm ready.
not_available Okay.
not_available What the hell are you doing? 
not_available She was scared.
not_available I wanted her to know there was another option than waiting for us to swoop in.
not_available If we're gonna find Dubaku, there are no other options.
not_available You understand? Come on.
not_available You've run operations like this.
not_available Not without full tactical support and at least two backup units in the scene.
not_available She's naked out there, Jack.
not_available I don't like it.
not_available This isn't about you.
not_available This is about her and Dubaku.
not_available Listen, life gets ugly.
not_available Innocent people get hurt.
not_available That's a reality.
not_available At least she got to make a choice to be involved, to do the right thing which is a lot more than I can say for Dubaku's other victims.
not_available We have one job here
not_available that's to get Dubaku.
not_available Outside of that, don't get involved.
not_available Chloe, the car's here.
not_available Copy that.
not_available She's getting in the car.
not_available Copy.
not_available She's moving.
not_available Are you locked in? Yeah.
not_available I've got them heading south on 14th.
not_available Can you upload the tracking grid to Agent Walker's P.D.A.
not_available No.
not_available I'll have to direct you.
not_available Just keep us close.
not_available Understood.
not_available Head towards 14th, make a right.
not_available Copy that.
not_available How much further? Continuing west on R Street, crossing Hampshire Avenue.
not_available You're less than a mile behind the target car.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Target car is turning left on Connecticut.
not_available Okay.
not_available Rounding Dupont Circle.
not_available Agent Moss, is there anything in the northern quad of the grid that would indicate where Dubaku could hide a plane or a helicopter? 
not_available No.
not_available Nothing definitive.
not_available It could be any number oflaunch sites.
not_available Whoa, whoa, whoa.
not_available What was that? What happened? 
not_available Jack, we've got a problem.
not_available Chloe, what's wrong? We just lost the tracking grid.
not_available What? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available It just glitched out.
not_available We can't afford to lose them, Jack.
not_available I gave this woman my word we'd protect her.
not_available I know.
not_available Chloe, get it back up.
not_available We're doing our best, Jack.
not_available Wait.
not_available It's back up.
not_available What the hell happened? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I'm running a diagnostic right now.
not_available Jack, they're moving southeast on Massachusetts Avenue.
not_available You've closed the gap to about a half a mile.
not_available You may wanna back off a little bit.
not_available Okay.
not_available Copy that.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available What? 
not_available Somebody was in the system.
not_available What? What are you talking about? I'm saying someone in this office was mirroring my terminal.
not_available Whoever it was knows exactly what we were doing.
not_available Can you backtrace the breach? No.
not_available The link was severed.
not_available It could've come from anywhere.
not_available Jack, you getting this? Looks like we might have a security breach.
not_available Someone is mirroring our comm.
not_available Jack.
not_available They're coming from all sides.
not_available Larry, we got a situation here! What's going on? 
not_available I got Metro P.D.
not_available Trying to build a roadblock around us.
not_available What? Why would they be doing that? I don't know! Just get 'em off us! Larry, do something! This is Agent Moss.
not_available Connect me with Metro district command.
not_available Hands in the air! Hands in the air! My name is Jack Bauer! Get out of the car! My passenger is a federal agent! Get out of the car right now! On the ground! She's a federal agent! On the ground! Face down! Keep your hands behind your back, sir! Come on, Larry! Do something! 
not_available Captain, you've got to release these people immediately.
not_available But we have a federal warrant.
not_available No! That is a mistake.
not_available No federal warrants have been issued for them.
not_available Yes, they have.
not_available A warrant was called in for the vehicle.
not_available "Occupants armed and dangerous, to be apprehended with decisive force." Issued by whom? 
not_available F.B.I.
not_available This office.
not_available There's no attribution, but the routing code's real.
not_available This was definitely done by someone here.
not_available Marika's carjust turned east onto N Street.
not_available Captain, listen carefully.
not_available I am the special agent in charge of this operation.
not_available I am revoking these warrants immediately.
not_available Sir, you'll have to clear that with command.
not_available No.
not_available No, I don't have time to deal with your chain of command.
not_available You need to release these people right now! Hey, thank you.
not_available So, is O'Brian here to replace you? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available No? Larry's using her for some kind of covert operation with Jack Bauer.
not_available They're tracking a car to Dubaku.
not_available Why would he keep us in the dark about something like that? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know, but I don't like it.
not_available Yes? 
not_available Hey.
not_available I took care of Bauer and Walker.
not_available They're pinned down.
not_available Why am I being brought in on this so last
not_available minute? Moss is running this op on his own.
not_available It took me some time to tap into his phone line.
not_available He's on with Metro right now.
not_available Can you at least disable the tracking signal they're using to follow the girl? No.
not_available Not from my console.
not_available But judging by the frequency, they're using her cell as the tracker.
not_available All right.
not_available Good work.
not_available You told me that once Dubaku served his purpose, you'd take him out.
not_available Why are we still helping him? He's threatening to expose us using a database he's kept with names and accounts of everyone involved.
not_available Including mine? 
not_available I mean everyone! We don't know where the file is, so you just better pray that he gets away.
not_available Yes.
not_available It has to do with the terrorist threats that happened this morning.
not_available Hello? 
not_available You got a problem.
not_available What is it? Your girlfriend's been turned by the F.B.I.
not_available I don't believe you.
not_available They met with her a half hour ago, told her who you really are.
not_available That's impossible.
not_available Marika would never do this.
not_available I got it from my source inside the Bureau.
not_available It is definite.
not_available She agreed to lead them to you using her cell phone as a tracker.
not_available Look, my source managed to stall their surveillance team for a while but you need to get to the airfield immediately.
not_available I'll call my driver, have him take care of her.
not_available No.
not_available I'll do it.
not_available Colonel, I told you.
not_available They are tracking her.
not_available If you let her come to you, you're risking your chances of escape.
not_available I said I'll take care of her.

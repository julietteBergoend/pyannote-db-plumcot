
not_available Walsh isn't answering.
not_available As soon as you reach him, you find me.
not_available Is this the crew list from the 747? Yeah.
not_available Should I get a maintenance history on the plane? No.
not_available For now, let's just assume this was not an accident.
not_available Why? 
not_available It originated out of Berlin.
not_available It's where Walsh said the shooter was coming from.
not_available Break down the crew and passenger list.<br>.
not_available .<br>.<br>political affiliation, criminal record.<br>.
not_available country of origin and residence.
not_available Jack.
not_available What? You want to tell me what's going on here tonight? What's going on? Besides a 747 falling out of the sky and a threat on a presidential candidate's life? That's right.
not_available Besides that.
not_available Look, George Mason comes in here disappears up in your office for a half an hour, then he limps out.
not_available What's that all about? Tell him, Jack.
not_available Fine, then I will.
not_available Nina.
not_available The three agents that Jack brought down on bribery charges were close friends of Mason.
not_available He's been looking for payback ever since.
not_available He chose tonight to make some pretty nasty accusations about Jack as well as some other people in this office.
not_available In case you haven't noticed, Jack doesn't have a lot of tolerance for criticism.
not_available I need that right away.
not_available I'll get you that list within the hour.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That was quite a story.
not_available It's better than the truth.
not_available MAN: Did you get the ID? Yes.
not_available It's funny.
not_available When you came to Jack's rescue back there with your little performance.<br>.
not_available it reminded me of something.
not_available Yeah, what? Remember that time we came into work together about a month ago? Lisa made some wisecrack remark and you came up with this really great B.<br>S.
not_available story an early breakfast meeting with District Three.
not_available I was really impressed with how convincing a liar you are.
not_available What's your point, Tony? I want to know what happened up there between Jack and Mason.
not_available I already told you.
not_available And I don't believe you.
not_available Maybe I should ask Mason.
not_available A presidential candidate's life is at stake.
not_available Maybe you should get back to work.
not_available I think we need to turn right here.
not_available There it is.
not_available Janet? Janet? Hello? 
not_available Hey, sweetheart.
not_available Have you found the girls yet? 
not_available No.
not_available We just got here.
not_available Janet's car is parked out front.
not_available I just got here.
not_available All right.
not_available I'll wait 'til you check it out.
not_available No, let me call you back.
not_available I'll hold.
not_available Kim? 
not_available Teri? Kim? They were here.
not_available What did you give her? Nothing she didn't want.
not_available Look, my dad is a government agent.
not_available I thought you said your dad was dead.
not_available He's not.
not_available If I'm not home in the next half hour he's going to be all over this.
not_available Told you, you should have given her a roofie.
not_available I'm serious.
not_available You two are toast.
not_available She's giving me a headache, dude.
not_available Just chill, okay? 
not_available You chill.
not_available Walsh.
not_available Did anyone see you come in? 
not_available No.
not_available You weren't followed? 
not_available Take it easy.
not_available No, I'm not going to take it easy.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I should never have called you.
not_available If you have evidence that someone inside the agency is involved in a plot against David Palmer then you had no choice.
not_available Here.
not_available It's all yours.
not_available I'm out of this.
not_available Wait.
not_available A keycard? Yeah, it's just a simple keycard.
not_available The kind we use to get in and out of the building.
not_available I don't get it.
not_available Normally, the magnetic stripe has just an access code on it.
not_available But the stripe can hold a ton of data.
not_available On this one, I found a file filled with references to Palmer.
not_available What's the point? To smuggle confidential information.
not_available These get in and out of restricted areas without any scrutiny.
not_available I need you to be reachable throughout the day.
not_available You said after tonight I'm done.
not_available I can't help it, Scott.
not_available Until we defuse this situation, I need to be able to find you.
not_available I find out there's an agency conspiracy to kill David Palmer.
not_available The moment I realized what I stumbled onto, I put my wife and kid on a plane.
not_available I couldn't even tell them why.
not_available I've been here long enough to know what I'm dealing with.
not_available It's your thing now.
not_available I'm out.
not_available Scott.
not_available What you did took a lot of courage.
not_available I'm asking you to hang in there with me a little longer.
not_available I did my part.
not_available Get someone else.
not_available There is no one else.
not_available You got me for another 24 hours.
not_available Then I'm joining my family.
not_available Yes, I know Palmer gets a lot of death threats, but this one's got some weight.
not_available We're overloaded.
not_available We'll deal with it No, you're gonna have to make some adjustments in your schedule.
not_available You're gonna have to notify his advance team, tighten up security on your end.
not_available I understand Yes.
not_available I've gotta go.
not_available I'll update you in an hour.
not_available You'll updateOne hour? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Fine.
not_available Teri? Jack.
not_available I need you.
not_available Richard? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm at 2350 Dunlop Plaza.
not_available I got two shooters trying to hit me and an agent down.
not_available Richard, what's going on? I've got hard information on who is behind the Palmer hit.
not_available Isley can get there before me.
not_available He's in the area.
not_available No, don't call anyone.
not_available We still don't know who we can trust.
not_available Just get me out of here.
not_available I'll be there in 10 minutes.
not_available I'll be on the roof.
not_available Richard? Richard? Hello? Hey, It's Me.
not_available What's going on? Is Kim at the store? No, she's not here.
not_available I thought you said you saw their car.
not_available We think she left with the boys.
not_available This guy you're with, York does he know either of these boys? No, but one of them, Dan, works here.
not_available I'm starting to worry a little bit.
not_available Can't you get over here? I can't.
not_available I don't have time to explain, but some bad things are happening tonight.
not_available Our daughter's missing I think that's bad, don't you? Teri, she's not missing.
not_available She's partying.
not_available Kim's smart enough to know her limits.
not_available Yeah? Maybe you should come over here and see what those limits are, Jack.
not_available What's that supposed to mean? Nothing.
not_available We're going to wait here for them to come back for the car.
not_available Call me when you're done with your emergency, okay? I will.
not_available I'm sorry, okay? I'll call you as soon as I can.
not_available Bye.
not_available Look, I know it seems like we're these really bad guys but we're cool, I swear.
not_available There's just some stuff we got to do.
not_available Go along with it, and you guys won't get hurt.
not_available I don't even know what you want me to go along with.
not_available Is this some sort of fraternity stunt or something? Something like that.
not_available Fine.
not_available Whatever.
not_available I'll tell your friends whatever you want me to just let us go.
not_available It's not that simple.
not_available These people 
not_available What people? Dan, pull over.
not_available She's choking.
not_available It's okay.
not_available She's not breathing, you idiot! 
not_available I don't care.
not_available Stop.
not_available Get back! RICK: Don't be a moron! Don't be a bitch.
not_available Brush fires set off by the wreckage are making the prospect of locating possible survivors of Flight 221 virtually impossible.
not_available Has Carl called yet? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available Let me know as soon as he does.
not_available Okay.
not_available It's twenty after one.
not_available Weren't the kids supposed to be back by now? They stopped to get pizza after the rally.
not_available You seen this? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available It's horrible.
not_available I'm sorry I walked away before.
not_available What did Maureen Kingsley say to you on the phone? It's nothing serious.
not_available I'm overreacting to everything right now.
not_available Today is going to be the second most important day of my life.
not_available And what would the first one be? I think you know.
not_available I still like to hear you say it.
not_available All right.
not_available The most important day of my life was when I hit the game
not_available winning three against DePaul at the Final Four.
not_available You just lost my vote, Senator.
not_available Good night.
not_available Don't let this get to you.
not_available Thanks, honey.
not_available Good night.
not_available We already know about that.
not_available We've got another way around security.

not_available I just want him in place.

not_available You said there were two shooters.
not_available At least.
not_available Maybe three.
not_available They look like they were ours? I couldn't tell.
not_available How high does this conspiracy go? I don't know yet, Jack.
not_available Did you see anyone downstairs?

not_available That's amazing.
not_available You're going to kill David Palmer? Hey, where's Jack? I don't know.
not_available I thought you were on the phone with him.
not_available No, that was Division.
not_available Really? This is a military organization.
not_available There's a chain of command.
not_available I am your superior.
not_available I tell you what I want and you don't question it, got it? All right.
not_available I can accept that.
not_available Good.
not_available There's something you got to deal with.
not_available Yeah? What? You can boss me around all you want here but when you and I punch out we're something else okay? Okay, Tony.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, we're clear.
not_available Give me your tie.
not_available I want to fix this.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I should've been more careful.
not_available They could have been following Baylor.
not_available This was my fault.
not_available I set it up wrong.
not_available We were sitting ducks.
not_available I'm sorry to put you through this, Jack.
not_available Don't you ever say that to me.
not_available You of all people.
not_available I owe you my life.
not_available Across the mezzanine there's a corridor that leads to a service exit.
not_available We're gonna take that straight to the street.
not_available My car is right there.
not_available You okay? Good.
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available JACK: Take the wall.
not_available Jack! We got to find out who sent these guys.
not_available I'm gonna go ID him.
not_available Hey.
not_available It's okay.
not_available What the hell is this supposed to be? Give him the ID.
not_available It's okay.
not_available This'll be better for both of us.
not_available I figured it out.
not_available No, you don't figure anything out.
not_available This is not your play.
not_available Now, where is the damn ID? It is my play since I'm the only one who knows where the damn ID is.
not_available Go ahead.
not_available I didn't find anything useful in the back.
not_available Work schedule.
not_available Look.
not_available Dan

not_available How would he be able to do that? This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Leave a message.
not_available He turned his cell phone off.
not_available How would your husband be able to help? He works for the government, has access to things.
not_available Hang on.
not_available CTU, Nina Myers.
not_available Hi, Nina, it's Teri Bauer.
not_available Is Jack there? Teri, Jack's not here.
not_available He turned his phone off.
not_available I wonder if you could help me.
not_available Sure, what do you need? I need the name and number of the owner of a furniture store in the Valley in Van Nuys, uh, Paladio's Furniture.
not_available That's not something I should do.
not_available Can I wait 'til I talk to Jack about it? No, not really, um Nina, it's Kim.
not_available She took off with some kids I don't know.
not_available One of the boys, Dan, works here.
not_available I was hoping to contact the owner.
not_available All right, um Give me a minute, I'll see what I can do.
not_available What's your number? Hey! 
not_available Hey.
not_available There you are.
not_available Heard you guys had quite a turnout tonight.

not_available Dad, what are you doing up? 
not_available How you doing? Not enough hours in the day.
not_available Hey, Dad.
not_available How did it go? Mom, it was huge.

not_available Good night.
not_available I love you, honey.
not_available So, how was it? 
not_available Ah, Dad, it was unbelievable.
not_available The chancellor introduces me, right? I'm totally killing.
not_available Just as I'm finishing, Green Day starts to play "Time of Your Life.<br>" 
not_available Mom, it was huge.
not_available Hold on.
not_available The kids were going insane.
not_available Girls were screaming.
not_available Carl? What's the problem? I got a call tonight from Maureen Kingsley.
not_available Yeah, so what? I don't want to talk about it over the phone.
not_available Okay, I'll come by in the morning.
not_available No.
not_available We need to take care of this now.
not_available It's hard to know with teenage girls if they're angry at you or just angry.
not_available I know.
not_available I did feel guilty, though, when Jack and I separated.
not_available Separated? I didn't know.
not_available We're back together.
not_available I admire that.
not_available Trying to work through the problems together.
not_available My ex left and never looked back.
not_available Went home to Australia.
not_available She hasn't spoken with Janet or me for almost 10 years.

not_available I thought he was in there.
not_available Palmer has left.
not_available He's exposed.
not_available Find him.
not_available Tell me what's going on? If he left in one of the vehicles, it'll show up on our GPS.
not_available Would you tell me what's going on? We've been told to add another layer of security around your husband.
not_available Why? We have a very high confidence that there will be an attempt on his life sometime today.
not_available Stay close, Richard.
not_available I'm right behind you.
not_available I'm going to get you out of here.
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack, listen to me.
not_available Take this card and give it to Jamey.
not_available Baylor said that we could trust her.
not_available Richard, don't move.
not_available You'll draw fire.
not_available Take the card, give it to Jamey, she'll match it to a computer.
not_available Find the computer, you've got the dirty agent Richard! Farrell.
not_available Jamey, it's me.
not_available What do you need? Two agency personnel were killed tonight at 2350 Dunlop Plaza.
not_available I need you to phone Division, get their bodies picked up.
not_available Okay.
not_available That's not all.
not_available You know the key cards we use to get in and out of Division? Yeah? 
not_available I've got one.
not_available I need you to pull some data off it for me.
not_available Do you have anything that can read it? Yeah, but if you're in your car you can just send it to me now.
not_available How? 
not_available Use your mobile scanner.
not_available Switch it from optical to magnetic.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I'm sending this to you directly.
not_available You should be able to trace this to the person who encoded it.
not_available Yeah, I can match the electronic signature.
not_available Good, do it.
not_available Come on.
not_available What are you going to do to me? Take you to the prom.
not_available Come on, get out.
not_available Don't worry, it's going to be okay.
not_available Just tell her what you want her to do and then she'll do it.
not_available I said, "Get out!" It's time to call Mommy.
not_available Tell her you're at a party, you're sorry and you'll see her in a couple hours.
not_available Go to hell! Gaines said not to hurt her, remember? Fine.
not_available Call your mom! Hello? KIM: Mom? Kim, is that you? Hello? Mom? Honey, where are you? I'm at a party.
not_available What? I'm at a party.
not_available With Janet York, right? Yeah.

not_available Do you know how worried we were? Can I talk to Janet? Listen, Janet's dad wants to talk to her.
not_available She went for a walk.
not_available She'll call when she gets back.
not_available She went for a walk.
not_available KIM: We're okay and I'm sorry I did this, I mean it.
not_available I'll be home as soon as I get a ride back.
not_available You're not going to wait for a ride back.
not_available We'll come pick you up.
not_available Where are you? I don't even know how we got here.
not_available Kim? Honey, this is not the night you want to shine me on.
not_available I promise you! 
not_available Mom, I got to go.
not_available Kim.
not_available Mom, I love you.
not_available "I love you.<br>" Nice touch.
not_available Get in the van.
not_available What happened? I can't believe it.
not_available She's at this party.
not_available She said she was sorry and that she'd be back.
not_available And what about Janet? 
not_available She's fine.
not_available What's wrong? She said, "I love you.<br>" She never says that.
not_available Ok, Jack, I got a match on the card you sent me.
not_available Need a confidence on this? Yes, my eyes only, send it.
not_available Thanks, Jamey.
not_available You got it.

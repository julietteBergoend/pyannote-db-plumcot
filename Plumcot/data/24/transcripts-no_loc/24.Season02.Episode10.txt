
not_available Six hours ago a cache of weapons
not_available grade plutonium was found in a warehouse.
not_available We also found this.
not_available What do you make of that, guys? 
not_available This is a bill of lading from our company.
not_available For a container sent to Syed Ali.
not_available I can trackthe shipping order.
not_available The database is at the office.
not_available If my father really does work for the government, wouldn't he have known if Reza was doing something illegal? Who are you? My name is Syed Ali.
not_available You were looking in places you do not belong.
not_available I don't know anything! 
not_available Kill her.
not_available No.
not_available We're going down! The pilots don't know what happened.
not_available It felt like an explosion.
not_available They were shot down? By a groundto
not_available air missile.
not_available That's not Search and Rescue.
not_available Are they coming here for you? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Drop it.
not_available I'll tell you where the bomb is in exchange for immunity, for the murder of Jack Bauer.
not_available Someone from CTU is supposed to pick us up.
not_available Captain said it's out of their jurisdiction.
not_available We told you why we can't go backto LA.
not_available Yeah, I know.
not_available The bomb.
not_available Miss Myers, if the information you provide culminates in the interception of the nuclear device, you'll be pardoned in advance for the murder of Jack Bauer.
not_available Mr President, there was only one right choice to make and you made it.
not_available You've been told by a well
not_available respected member of the press, Mr Ron Wieland, that there is an imminent terrorist threat levelled against this country.
not_available That is true, so far as it goes.
not_available Please.
not_available The fact is, we get a dozen such threats every day.
not_available And do I know more about them than I publicly reveal? Of course.
not_available What is released to the public and when is a matter of judgement.
not_available You have elected me to exercise that judgement in the best interests of this country.
not_available That's what I've done since I took office.
not_available That's what I'm doing today.
not_available And I can assure you that we have the situation well under control, and there is no cause for alarm.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Not the Gettysburg Address, but it should buy us time.
not_available It was fine.
not_available What's the situation with Jack Bauer? 
not_available Still being held hostage by Nina Myers.
not_available It didn't have to be like this, Jack.
not_available I never meant for it to be personal.
not_available It felt pretty personal when you killed my wife.
not_available I had to.
not_available Teri overheard something that compromised my escape route.
not_available What about bombing CTU? All those people you used to work with? I didn't bomb CTU.
not_available I just sold the plans.
not_available You believe whatyou have to, butyou killed your friends.
not_available Shut up, Jack! Shut up! Now we are done talking! We're just gonna wait for Palmer to call and then this'll all be over.
not_available You got it? You know what, Nina? You're right.
not_available I don't really wanna just sit here and wait to die.
not_available Don't move, Jack! I mean it! You kill me before they verify the information, you'll be in violation of your agreement.
not_available They'll just slap your ass back in jail.
not_available And you'll be dead.
not_available I'm already dead.
not_available Last warning, Jack.
not_available That's it.
not_available One more step and I'll shoot.
not_available Argh! Move, move, move! 
not_available Secure the weapon.
not_available Got it.
not_available Notify the chopper.
not_available Get her up.
not_available Let's go.
not_available We're not going backto LA.
not_available We've been through this.
not_available I told you before.
not_available I know, the bomb.
not_available Move.
not_available Walk.
not_available Forget about us.
not_available You wanna get blown to pieces? I told you who my dad was.
not_available You thinkthey'd send someone from CTU? 
not_available Get in.
not_available I'm not going backto LA.
not_available Miguel! 
not_available Get down! Get down! Don't move.
not_available I got him.
not_available Miguel! 
not_available Careful.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Get in.
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available Yes, I'll tell him.
not_available It's over.
not_available Is Jack OK? 
not_available They got to Nina before she shot him.
not_available What about her? 
not_available As you requested, she wasn't seriously hurt.
not_available They're awaiting orders.
not_available Do you want her taken to prison? No.
not_available We'll honour our original deal.
not_available I'll pardon her as soon as we confirm her information.
not_available In the meantime, where do you want her? 
not_available Los Angeles.
not_available Let her share the fate of everyone she's endangered.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available That's affirmative.
not_available I'll meet the chopper just south of the gully in the field.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Copy.
not_available Now We're here to find transactions you claim Bob Warner had with Syed Ali.
not_available The sooner we do that, the sooner we're out of here.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available I can't work like this.
not_available I'll be keying the computer.
not_available How do I open the invoice files? What? 
not_available I need to access the invoice files.
not_available File, open, warehouse.
not_available How are they ordered? 
not_available Chronologically, I think.
not_available You think? Look, my fiancée just left me on my wedding day because I'm sending her father to jail.
not_available And since he's my employer, that pretty much means my whole life's in the toilet.
not_available So why don'tyou cut me some slack? There's a nuke somewhere in this city.
not_available And if you don't give me something useful in the next hour, I'll take you backto CTU and chain you to the roof, so you'll have a front row seat when the damn thing goes off.
not_available Do you want to suffer as he did? No, of course not.
not_available Then tell me whatyou've learned from your father's computer files, who you told.
not_available I already told you.
not_available I don't know anything.
not_available Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack? Mr President, the soldiers that attacked us at the crash site, they were Americans, or at least, American trained.
not_available What? One of the soldiers that was killed had a tattoo of a coral snake on his arm.
not_available That's a signature of a group out of Fort Benning.
not_available What sort of group? 
not_available A deep cover special ops unit.
not_available The only reason I know about the tattoos, is because early in my career they tried to recruit me.
not_available Their commander is a Colonel Samuels.
not_available I've never heard of this unit.
not_available No, you wouldn't have.
not_available That's the point.
not_available They'd be buried pretty heavily in NSA's budget.
not_available NSA.
not_available OK.
not_available Even if NSA originally trained him, isn't it possible he's freelancing now? A mercenary? If it was just the tattoo, I'd agree with you.
not_available But the men that attacked us had access to our flight plan.
not_available The only way they could have got that information was from on the inside.
not_available Mr President, I know it sounds very far
not_available fetched that we got attacked by Americans, but that tattoo is very distinctive and very specific.
not_available I appreciate the information.
not_available Where are you now? We're in a chopper.
not_available We're on our way to the address that Nina Meyers provided for us.
not_available We should be touching down soon, sir.
not_available Our ETA is 15 minutes.
not_available Keep me posted, Jack.
not_available Yes, Mr President.
not_available Jack's on his way to the Syed Ali house.
not_available Do you want a feed up here? No.
not_available I assume you have that under control.
not_available Yeah, we do.
not_available Was there something else? I'm sorry.
not_available So what are you gonna do tomorrow? What? 
not_available If the bomb doesn't go off.
not_available Thought about it? No.
not_available You'll probably come backto work here? Of course.
not_available Why wouldn't I? I don't know.
not_available Are you happy in this job? Hm? Believe it or not, I used to want to be a teacher a long time ago.
not_available You know why I didn't? Cos DOD offered me more money.
not_available That's how I made my decision.
not_available So I made myself miserable, and I made everybody else around me miserable for an extra $5,000 a year.
not_available That was my price.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You know, Michelle, I'm not a big advice giver, but under the circumstances Don't wait around for your life to happen to you.
not_available Find something that makes you happy, do it.
not_available Because everything else is all just background noise.
not_available Roger.
not_available Mr President.
not_available Tell me everything you know about Colonel Ron Samuels from Fort Benning.
not_available I don't know anything about Samuels.
not_available What about a special ops units from down there called Coral Snake? No, sir.
not_available Nothing.
not_available How could NSA be funding a paramilitary group and you not know about it? Without knowing specifics, I really can't say for sure.
not_available My guess is that the Department of Defense has used some of their discretionary resources, attached our name for budgetary purposes.
not_available It happens all the time.
not_available That's absurd.
not_available NSA is information gathering only.
not_available They have no military mandate.
not_available I'd assume that this Coral Snake group, like many others that we see, falls under somebody's pet project, gets funded on the sly.
not_available How would you knowthat, Roger? A minute ago you told me you'd never heard of them.
not_available I'm just conjecturing from past experience, Mr President.
not_available I have no concrete information.
not_available Let me look into it.
not_available You do that.
not_available Jack Bauer's plane was shot down by an American military unit.
not_available Jacktold me himself.
not_available I won't go into details, except to say that I believe him.
not_available American military? Why? I just spoke to Roger Stanton.
not_available I think he's hiding something from me.
not_available I'm going to arrest him.
not_available Arrest the head of NSA? Bauer said the unit that attacked his plane is connected to a Colonel Samuels.
not_available Samuels is funded by NSA.
not_available With all due respect, David, that's pretty thin.
not_available By itself, yes.
not_available But the ambassador's chopper crash, the evacuation of military personnel out of LA, Ron Wieland's escape from custody, those things happened after Stanton arrived.
not_available Firing Stanton will cause chaos.
not_available All the agencies report through him.
not_available He's running the search for the bomb, for crying out loud.
not_available If the president's right, he's not running it, he's impeding it.
not_available Why would he do such a thing? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available But if he is, we have a better chance of finding the bomb if we get rid of him.
not_available David you can't do this on a hunch.
not_available If Stanton turns out to be innocent and that bomb goes off, you'll be blamed for the death of millions.
not_available If you do nothing and he is guilty of something, you'll be blamed anyway.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available At the very least, we need to get some kind of proof, some evidence.
not_available You cannot just arrest the head of NSA, David.
not_available Sherry's right, Mike.
not_available We need proof.
not_available Find me a connection between Stanton and this Colonel Samuels.
not_available And find it quickly.
not_available LA County 470, go ahead.
not_available This is Officer Brown with Valley.
not_available I'm trying to reach Detective Bill Gucoff.
not_available Brown.
not_available You're transporting two suspects down to Central? Mm
not_available hm, that's right.
not_available Hold on.
not_available I'll patch you through.
not_available Gucoff here.
not_available Hey, Bill.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available I'm bringing the prisoners down.
not_available All right.
not_available You got everything under control? The guy gave us trouble What? 
not_available Get the bandanna out of my pocket.
not_available Why? 
not_available To start a fire.
not_available What? You're crazy.
not_available He'll have to pull over and stop the car.
not_available And then he'll put it out.
not_available Then what? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe it'll do enough damage and we'll have to go backto the station.
not_available It'll buy us time.
not_available That is just crazy.
not_available Crazier than going to Los Angeles where a nuclear bomb might go off any minute? Hey, listen, this may sound a little crazy, but did you happen to hear anything about some kind of a bomb threat today? What? I can't do this.
not_available You gotta do it.
not_available No.
not_available Kim, you can do it.
not_available You're smaller.
not_available No, I haven't heard anything.
not_available Come on.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It may be nothing, but one of the kids here, apparently her father works for CTU.
not_available He gave her some kind of information about a bomb.
not_available Just check it out for me.
not_available Like I said, it's probably nothing, but No problem.
not_available OK, Gucoff.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I owe you one.
not_available Kim.
not_available Hang on, OK? 
not_available Hello.
not_available Can anyone hear me? 
not_available This is CHP Station Six.
not_available Kim.
not_available Kim.
not_available Don't.
not_available We're on San Fernando, the 118.
not_available There's been an accident.
not_available We need an ambulance.
not_available How's the offiicer? 
not_available Hurt.
not_available So is someone else.
not_available Two injured? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Stay there.
not_available We're sending someone now.
not_available Hang on.
not_available All units.
not_available All units proceed to San Fernando at the 118.
not_available MVA.
not_available Offiicer down.
not_available Offiicer down.
not_available I'm gonna ask you just once more, huh? Who did you tell? No one.
not_available Here's an infrared of the house.
not_available Two people in this room.
not_available We assume one is Ali, but we'll need to take 'em both alive.
not_available Your men in position? 
not_available In 90 seconds.
not_available Good.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available George, it's me.
not_available Where are you? I'm on site.
not_available Syed Ali's in the house.
not_available We're gonna move in a minute.
not_available We need auxiliary teams ready to move as soon as we find out the location of this bomb.
not_available We're already working on it.
not_available I'll get backto you as soon as we get him.
not_available Agent Baker? Let me know when your teams are ready.
not_available This is Bob Warner's access code.
not_available As you can see, he logged on roughly twice as often as I did.
not_available This is a restricted area.
not_available I need to speak with Reza.
not_available I'm afraid I can't do that.
not_available Just a minute.
not_available It's our wedding day.
not_available I realise that.
not_available We're in the middle of an investigation.
not_available Can I talkto him for one minute? Can I talkto Reza for a minute? 
not_available I tried to explain.
not_available Make it fast.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Marie? Hey, what I said before, I didn't mean it.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available This has been such a shock.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available It's all right.
not_available You are the man I'm going to marry.
not_available I know, whatever you're doing, you have to do it.
not_available I love you.
not_available Whatever happens, happens.
not_available My angel.
not_available We have to get backto work.
not_available You can wait in the next room if you'd like.
not_available Thank you.
not_available It was barely a nick, not nearly as bad as it feels.
not_available You don't have to kill me.
not_available Just leave me here.
not_available By the time someone finds me, you'll be 100 miles away.
not_available Something's going to happen, very soon.
not_available Something terrible, which will cause much suffering.
not_available This will be easier.
not_available Take cover! Fall back.
not_available Fall back.
not_available I have here a woman! If you come any closer, I'll kill the woman! 
not_available Bring in the shield now.
not_available We need the body bunker right away.
not_available They don't negotiate.
not_available Yet they do shoot.
not_available It's notyou they want alive, it's me.
not_available I'll try and take him out with a beanbag hit.
not_available Suspect is secure.
not_available You're all right.
not_available You're all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Take a breath.
not_available It's over.
not_available It's over.
not_available OK? 
not_available Jack, he's going into convulsions.
not_available What? Did you see him take anything? 
not_available I was watching him the whole time.
not_available Cyanide.
not_available He must have had it in his mouth.
not_available We need a medic in here now! We need a medic now! Copy that.
not_available Dammit! I want him photographed, fingerprints.
not_available Send it to CTU for analysis.
not_available I want confirmation that that is Syed Ali.
not_available You called them.
not_available You should go.
not_available I'll go when they get here.
not_available It'll be too late.
not_available They'll see you.
not_available I'll be fine.
not_available Thank you so much for everything.
not_available As soon as this is all over, I'm gonna find you.
not_available OK? I promise.
not_available Go.
not_available Notify Dispatch.
not_available 143.
not_available Did you get the area locked down? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available You should drink some water.
not_available Kate, my name is Jack Bauer.
not_available I'm a federal agent.
not_available You've been through an ordeal, but I have to ask you a few questions.
not_available Is that all right? How did you get here? 
not_available Um I was trying to help my sister.
not_available So I hired a private investigator.
not_available Those men thought we knew something Slow down, slow down.
not_available The dead man in the other room was a private investigator? Paul Koplin.
not_available What they did to him They? There was more than one man here? How many men were there? Two.
not_available The other one left before you came.
not_available Did you get his name? 
not_available Syed Ali.
not_available Are you sure? Can you describe him for me? Tall.
not_available Thin.
not_available Do you remember what he was wearing? A black shirt.
not_available With silver buttons down the front.
not_available Black pants.
not_available Do you remember what kind of a car he got into? Do you know where he was going? Excuse me for one moment.
not_available Baker, this is Agent Bauer.
not_available Syed Ali is still alive.
not_available We are looking for a Middle Eastern man, wearing all black.
not_available I didn't get a make on the car.
not_available Send out an APB.
not_available We need to find him now.
not_available Copy.
not_available Kate, you said you came here to help your sister.
not_available Who is she? Marie.
not_available Marie Warner.
not_available She was supposed to get married today.
not_available Tell Mike whatyou told me.
not_available There's a back
not_available channel communications networkthe CIA used to use, called OPCOM.
not_available It's been shut down for over 20 years.
not_available Last month, NSA was given orders to resurrect it.
not_available It was an eyes
not_available only order issued by Roger Stanton.
not_available I'm not sure that's enough.
not_available By itself, it's not.
not_available Unless Stanton used OPCOM to contact Colonel Samuels in the last few hours.
not_available My source is checking on that now.
not_available Mike, call the Attorney General.
not_available Start working on this from the legal side.
not_available If we find this connection, we'll move on it, have Stanton arrested.
not_available I think we got a positive ID.
not_available Cross
not_available reference his prints with the name Paul Koplin.
not_available CTU? 
not_available Bauer.
not_available Put me through to Tony.
not_available Hold, please.
not_available It's Tony.
not_available What's up? 
not_available I'm still at the house.
not_available I just questioned the woman that Ali was torturing for information.
not_available Her name is Kate Warner.
not_available Run a background check.
not_available Did you say Kate Warner? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Why? I had her family picked up this morning.
not_available I was with her hours ago.
not_available What's the connection? 
not_available Reza Naiyeer, her sister's fiancé, had dealings with Syed Ali.
not_available He's denying it.
not_available He says it was the father, Bob Warner.
not_available Richards took Naiyeer to Bob Warner's office to hack into his computer.
not_available I have Warner here with me right now.
not_available Jack, will Kate talkto you? Cos her family's not cooperating.
not_available Yeah.
not_available But I gotta give her time.
not_available She's been through hell.
not_available You should see this place.
not_available Jack, there's one more thing.
not_available What? The father, Bob Warner, he freelances for the CIA.
not_available We're gonna have to start from the beginning.
not_available You'll have to run everything again.
not_available Start connecting the dots.
not_available These people are involved.
not_available You gotta find out how.
not_available Get backto me when you've got anything.
not_available All right, you got it.
not_available Gentlemen, I need you to pack up.
not_available I need the room.
not_available Agent Baker? 
not_available Baker here.
not_available How's Miss Warner doing? 
not_available Not so good.
not_available As soon as you think she's ready, bring her down to the bathroom.
not_available Will do.
not_available Baker out.
not_available Those three dates and anything the following week.
not_available Hold on.
not_available OK.
not_available Good.
not_available Let me know as soon as you find something out.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Sir? What have we got? 
not_available I found a way into the OPCOM channels.
not_available Good.
not_available Tunnel in.
not_available The problem is, the files are pass code protected.
not_available We'll need someone internal to open them.
not_available It'll take time.
not_available Hold.
not_available No, it's not.
not_available I just got the name of a deputy director who's retired, but his code is still active.
not_available We could use that.
not_available Jean, could you hold on for a sec? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Let's see.
not_available Try this.
not_available It should work.
not_available I'm back.
not_available I'll head over to the OC and check it out.
not_available Good.
not_available Oh, that's terrific.
not_available Jean, I'm gonna cross
not_available reference these, but I need you to stay in the office.
not_available No problem.
not_available Right.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Bye.
not_available I'm collecting the dates that Samuels' office logged onto OPCOM.
not_available If Mike can trace Stanton's access, we can look for a match.
not_available That's great.
not_available If we have that, you'll have the proof.
not_available Stanton has a dozen staff who share his code.
not_available How are we gonna pin it on him? There's a four
not_available digit subcode that only belongs to him.
not_available That's the one that'll nail him.
not_available Sherry? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You're doing an incredible job here today.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'd forgotten howtalented you are at all this stuff.
not_available David, I've worked with you for over 25 years.
not_available It had to rub off on me somehow.
not_available I'm glad you're here.
not_available I have always been here.
not_available You remember that.
not_available Yeah.
not_available All right.
not_available Call me if there's anything.
not_available That was Barbara at the Warner office.
not_available What'd they find? Nothing yet.
not_available They're still going through the records.
not_available Reza seems to be cooperating.
not_available This is driving me crazy.
not_available It doesn't make sense that Syed Ali has a connection to this white
not_available bread family.
not_available So you believe Bob Warner? There's nothing in his profile or behaviour that suggests he's involved with terrorists.
not_available I agree.
not_available But look at the facts.
not_available There is a paper trail between Warner Investments and Ali.
not_available Kate Warner was abducted for a reason.
not_available I know.
not_available Look, put together a list of all the managers and directors of Bob Warner's company.
not_available I want to widen the search a notch.
not_available Good idea.
not_available Anything else? Yeah.
not_available I was talking to Mason before, and And? This is hardly the time, but I don't know how much time we have, so I just wanted you to know that if you wanted to go out sometime Michelle 
not_available I just wanted you to know how I felt.
not_available No, Michelle I feel the same way.
not_available I've just been keeping my distance because Because of what happened between you and Nina? Yeah.
not_available So you think I just wantyou for your information? So what are we saying here, then? If we save LA from a nuclear bomb, then you and I can get together for dinner and a movie? Is that it? 
not_available I'll get that list.
not_available Yeah, that's Syed Ali left after he killed Mr Koplin.
not_available They talked for a minute or two.
not_available They looked at me a couple of times.
not_available It was like like I wasn't important any more.
not_available They embraced, and he left.
not_available Did they say anything to each other when he was leaving? Yes, but they spoke so softly.
not_available And mostly in Arabic.
not_available Arabic? How can you be so sure? My family lived in Saudi Arabia when I was younger.
not_available When my sister got engaged to Reza, I picked it up again.
not_available Can you identify any words that they said? Anything at all? Salat.
not_available They said "salat" several times.
not_available It means prayer.
not_available But I couldn't really hear anything.
not_available They were so soft.
not_available Baker, this is Jack.
not_available Get ahold of CTU.
not_available I want a list of every mosque in a 15
not_available mile radius.
not_available Mosques? 
not_available They talked about prayer before Ali left.
not_available The time fits.
not_available Roger that.
not_available Did that help? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Yes, I think it did.
not_available OK.
not_available Kate, the normal protocol would be to transfer you backto CTU for further debriefing.
not_available But the truth is, I don't know what Syed Ali looks like.
not_available No one does, except for you.
not_available I need you to identify him for me.
not_available Stanton.
not_available It's me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available You know better than to call me here.
not_available They know about OPCOM.
not_available How? 
not_available I told them.
not_available What?! 
not_available David had the bit between his teeth.
not_available He was gonna find out one way or another.
not_available This way, I get him trusting me again, little by little.
not_available What do we do now? 
not_available They'll connectyou to the plane.

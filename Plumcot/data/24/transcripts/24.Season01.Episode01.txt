jack_bauer Good .
jack_bauer Tony , I need detailed background on everyone on David Palmer's staff , now .
tony_almeida Why ?
jack_bauer 'Cause
jack_bauer I think this is about him .
jack_bauer I want us to be prepared .
tony_almeida Bad time to play a hunch .
tony_almeida If it leaks out that we're screening him , people might think it's 'cause he's black .
jack_bauer It is because he's black .
jack_bauer It makes him the most likely target .
tony_almeida It might not be interpreted that way on the outside .
jack_bauer I don't care how it's interpreted .
jack_bauer I just gave you an order
jack_bauer and I'd like you to follow it , please .
not_available Good .
jack_bauer Thank you .
jack_bauer Let me know as soon as Walsh gets here .

maureen_kingsley Polls open in less than seven hours here in California .

not_available Yeah .
maureen_kingsley Senator Palmer arrived in Los Angeles this morning and showed a young group of fans .
jack_bauer Frank , it's Jack Bauer , over at CTU .
jack_bauer This is embarrassing , but my daughter snuck out of the house and she's not back yet .
jack_bauer If we sent her vitals over could you guys keep an eye out for her ?
jack_bauer Yeah , no , I'm sure she's okay .
jack_bauer No , that'd be great .
jack_bauer Thanks a lot .
jack_bauer I owe you .
not_available Bye .
jack_bauer Richard .
jack_bauer Everybody's inside .
jack_bauer Come on .
not_available Good .
nina_myers Mr .
nina_myers Walsh .
not_available Hello , Nina Shall we get started ?
richard_walsh Please .
richard_walsh We believe that by the end of the day an attempt will be made on David Palmer's life .
jack_bauer How good's his security ?
richard_walsh Very good .
richard_walsh Maybe not good enough to handle what's coming today
richard_walsh a shooter , well funded , from overseas .
nina_myers What foreign power wants Palmer dead ?
richard_walsh Probably none .
richard_walsh Most likely a domestic hate group hired someone from out of the country .
richard_walsh It's harder to trace .
richard_walsh Check the background of everyone around Palmer .
richard_walsh Cross it with terrorist databases .
richard_walsh Start now .
jack_bauer Okay , we're on it .
jack_bauer Let's go .
not_available Jack .
richard_walsh I'll be right with you .
richard_walsh How you doing ?
jack_bauer I can't complain .
richard_walsh Can't or won't ?
richard_walsh Things better at home ?
not_available Yeah .
jack_bauer We're trying .
richard_walsh What I'm about to tell you doesn't leave this room .
jack_bauer Fine .
richard_walsh There may be an element inside the Agency involved with this hit .
not_available What ?
richard_walsh For the next 24 hours , I want you all over this .
richard_walsh You'll be interfacing with every division in the region .
jack_bauer I am the last person on this planet you want to bring something like this to .
richard_walsh I don't agree .
jack_bauer Richard .
jack_bauer I built a case against three of our own agents and busted them for taking bribes .
jack_bauer If there's a conspiracy in the Agency to kill Palmer , I'll never get near it .
richard_walsh Well , you'll have to , Jack 'cause you're the only guy that I can trust .
richard_walsh If Palmer gets hit the first African American with a real shot at the White House it'll tear this country apart .
jack_bauer I'll look into it .
jack_bauer I'll do the best I can .
not_available Good .
richard_walsh George Mason is coming from Division to give you a detailed briefing on Palmer .
jack_bauer You think I should trust George Mason ?
richard_walsh Until we get a better handle on things don't trust anybody .
richard_walsh Not even your own people .
richard_walsh We got to find the shooter , Jack .
richard_walsh Whatever it takes .
jonathan_matijevich Excuse me .
jonathan_matijevich How much longer till we land in Los Angeles ?
flight_attendant Let's see .
flight_attendant It's 12:20 .

jonathan_matijevich I'll see you then .
patty_brooks Fly safe .
mandy Excuse me .
mandy You know David Palmer ?
jonathan_matijevich Not yet .
jonathan_matijevich I am meeting him tomorrow .

mandy and you never even mentioned it .
jonathan_matijevich I'm going to be taking a few pictures of him .
mandy You're a photographer ?
mandy Have I ever seen one of your photographs ?
nina_myers What's next ?
jack_bauer George Mason will be here in a few minutes and then he's going to brief me .
nina_myers You , not us ?
nina_myers You can't shut me out , Jack .
nina_myers Not here .
not_available It's Walsh .
jack_bauer He wants me to meet Mason alone .
not_available Why ?
jack_bauer He didn't say .
nina_myers You're lying .
jack_bauer Yes , I am , but you're still going to have to trust me .
nina_myers One of these days you're going to ask for too much .
jack_bauer I'm terribly afraid that today's going to be that day .
jack_bauer Yeah ?
teri_bauer Hi , it's me .
jack_bauer Did you hear anything ?
not_available No .
jack_bauer What's wrong ?
teri_bauer I found three joints in her desk .
jack_bauer Terrific .
teri_bauer I know it's not the end of the world , but I don't like it .
jack_bauer I don't either .
jack_bauer Maybe you can get into her e mail check her messages or something .
teri_bauer We gave her her own password to show that we trusted her , remember ?
not_available Yeah .
jack_bauer Honey , I. I'm so sorry that I can't be there with you right now .
not_available Okay .
jack_bauer Okay , bye .
nina_myers Everything
nina_myers okay ?

rick_allen When I got into San Diego State I figured , " What the hell? "
rick_allen " Give college a try.<br
kim_bauer > " Do you live near the beach ?
not_available Yeah .
kim_bauer Do you surf ?
not_available No .
rick_allen Surfing's way too motivated .
rick_allen You got to get wet , there's sharks you got to call everybody " dude.<br>
rick_allen " Why ?
kim_bauer No reason .
kim_bauer My dad surfs .
kim_bauer Surfed .
rick_allen He doesn't anymore ?
rick_allen He's too old ?
kim_bauer My father's dead .
rick_allen Hey , my bad .
kim_bauer It's okay .
kim_bauer He was this really great guy , and then six months ago , he.<br
not_available > .
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available Yeah .
kim_bauer I'm over it .
kim_bauer Getting over it .
kim_bauer It's hard but I am .
not_available Hey .
nina_myers Mason's on his way up .
jack_bauer George .
not_available Jack .
george_mason How's it going ?
jack_bauer Good to see you .
jack_bauer Come on in .
george_mason How much did Walsh tell you down there ?
jack_bauer Not much .
jack_bauer Palmer's the target , shooter's the real deal .
jack_bauer That's about it .
george_mason I can narrow it down for you a bit , if you like .
jack_bauer Please do .
george_mason We think the shooter's European , probably German and that he's either here already or he's coming today .
george_mason This will get you into secured data nationwide .
george_mason See if it clicks with anything you already have .
jack_bauer Who's the source on this ?
george_mason That I can't give you .
jack_bauer Because ?
george_mason Because I'm not authorized to .
jack_bauer How can I cross check the data if I don't know where the original information's coming from ?
george_mason What do you know about Palmer's politics ?
george_mason You know he's no friend to the Agency , right ?
george_mason And if he gets elected , this place gets gutted .
jack_bauer What are you trying to say ?
george_mason I'm not saying anything .
george_mason Saying do your job , and stay out of what doesn't concern you .
jack_bauer Fair enough .
not_available Good .
george_mason Then we're done .
jack_bauer George .
jack_bauer I need a favor .
jack_bauer I need you to call your boss and ask him to give me clearance on the ID of this source .
george_mason I thought we agreed that it didn't matter .
jack_bauer But I still got to call Walsh and tell him that I did everything I could .
jack_bauer I would like to cover my own ass .
george_mason Jack , you're finally learning how to play the game .
george_mason Sure , I'll call Chappelle for you .
george_mason Use your phone ?
jack_bauer Please do .
jack_bauer You want a cup of coffee ?
george_mason No , I'm good .
george_mason Thanks .
jack_bauer I want to hear Mason's call .

not_available What ?
jack_bauer The binder .
not_available Get me the binder At the sound of the tone We need to talk about this ?
ctu_staffer Nina ?
george_mason You can consider your ass officially covered .
george_mason Chappelle said no .
nina_myers You are out of your mind .
jack_bauer Mason's holding something back
jack_bauer I need some bargaining power .
nina_myers How are you going to get it ?
jack_bauer Remember Phillipe Darcet ?
nina_myers Heroin dealer , Barcelona ?
not_available Yeah .
jack_bauer Mason was the point man on his bust last August .
jack_bauer When they rolled up Darcet's assets , $200,000 was missing .
jack_bauer I always thought it fell into Mason's pockets .
jack_bauer Now I need proof .
nina_myers You're going to blackmail a District director ?
jack_bauer I want you to check Darcet's accounts .
jack_bauer You can access them through the secured files .
jack_bauer Use this .
jack_bauer Nina , he's going to wake up in a half an hour or less .
maureen_kingsley Senator Palmer , blending intelligence political courage , hard work , and luck .

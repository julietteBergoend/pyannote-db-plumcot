nina_myers Everyone I'm sorry to tell you that Jamey Farrell tried to commit suicide a few minutes ago .
nina_myers Fortunately , she's still alive and they're doing everything they can to keep her that way .
nina_myers I know it won't be easy to put this out of our minds , but we have no choice .
nina_myers There's still reason to believe Senator Palmer's life is in danger which means we all have to get back to work , now .
not_available You wanna look at this ?
not_available Not now .
nina_myers Call Jamey's mom , explain what happened .
not_available Have her pick up Kyle .
not_available CTU , Myers .

not_available I don't know .
nina_myers She barely had time to say her name before she got disconnected .
not_available What happened ?
nina_myers She didn't call back and when I tried to redial , the number was blocked .
not_available She sounded Okay .
not_available She sounded all right .
jack_bauer The police have thrown a net over this entire area .
jack_bauer There's nothing I can do to help Teri until I get through it .
nina_myers Maybe you should think about turning yourself in .
nina_myers Tell your side of the story .
not_available No .
jack_bauer Gaines will keep Teri and Kim alive as long as he thinks I can be useful to him .
jack_bauer If I'm in custody , I won't be .
jack_bauer Scan the police frequencies , see if you can locate any of these roadblocks for me .
not_available All right .
not_available Just a minute .
not_available Okay .
not_available Jamey give you anything else ?
nina_myers Jack Jamey tried to kill herself .
not_available Jack , did you hear me ?
not_available Jack ?
jack_bauer Yeah , you said she tried ?
nina_myers We sent her to County , but it doesn't look good .
jack_bauer Are you sure it was a suicide attempt ?
nina_myers Yeah , she slit her wrists .
not_available Where was her son Kyle ?
nina_myers He didn't see anything .
nina_myers We've already called Jamey's mom .
not_available She's on her way to pick him up .
jack_bauer Okay , send someone down to County to question Jamey in case she makes it .
jack_bauer Right now she's still our best source of information .
not_available Okay .
jack_bauer Damn it !
nina_myers What's wrong ?
jack_bauer They set up a road block at Montana .
jack_bauer Nina , I could have used the heads up here .
nina_myers I'm sorry , they must have set it up before I started scanning .
not_available Find me another route .
nina_myers All right , give me a second to pull up LA traffic .
not_available You go to the window .
teri_bauer You let me know if somebody comes .
nina_myers Tony , Line 3 , can you get it ?
not_available Almeida .
nina_myers Okay , it looks like roadblocks aren't your only problem .
nina_myers They sent a description of you to all the units in the area .
tony_almeida Nina , it's Teri Bauer .
nina_myers Jack , hold on a minute .
not_available Teri ?
not_available Nina , thank God .
not_available Where are you ?
teri_bauer I don't know , but I got ahold of a phone .

nina_myers Leave the line open as long as you can so we can set up a trace .
not_available Do you understand ?
not_available Yeah .
nina_myers Have Milo set up the trace on Line 3 .
not_available Jack ?
nina_myers I've got Teri .
not_available Patch her through .
not_available Mom , someone's coming .
not_available He's here !
not_available Teri ?
teri_bauer What do you want from us ?
eli_stram I think I left my phone in here .
not_available You seen it ?
kim_bauer No , I haven't .
nina_myers Jack , I've muted our side of the conversation .
jack_bauer Have you set up a trace on the call ?
not_available Yeah .
nina_myers I told Teri to leave the line open .
not_available Good .
not_available Keep our side muted .

eli_stram They moved everything around in here .
not_available Damn it !
not_available Rick , you see it anywhere ?
not_available No .
not_available Got anything on that trace ?
milo_pressman Latitude is somewhere north of the 10 .
milo_pressman I should have a rough longitude in a couple of minutes .
milo_pressman Triangulating the longitude is trickier .
dave_thompson#unknown#24.Season01.Episode10 This is Dave in Jet Copter 3 .
dave_thompson#unknown#24.Season01.Episode10 We're seeing some congestion in North Hollywood at Verdugo around the Grant Street Elementary School .
dave_thompson#unknown#24.Season01.Episode10 Senator Palmer is due to make an appearance there , and it looks like supporters and media are hoping to catch a glimpse of the presidential candidate , who apparently , is not letting this morning's incident interfere with his schedule .
sherry_palmer I don't understand the rationale behind it .
sherry_palmer No , listen to me .
not_available Why ?
sherry_palmer Why defend something that you don't need to defend ?
sherry_palmer Maureen Kingsley is not coming out with the story today .
not_available She will .
not_available We don't know that .
president_david_palmer Look , if not now , tomorrow .
president_david_palmer If not her , someone else .
president_david_palmer Our son is accused of murder .
president_david_palmer The story's too big to hide .
not_available Mike .
mike_novick He's right , Sherry .
mike_novick We need to control when and how this story comes out .
sherry_palmer One hour ago , someone tried to kill my husband .
sherry_palmer That bought us time and we should use it .
mike_novick The assassination attempt might even work for us if we break the story about Keith .
mike_novick It might put the public in a more forgiving frame of mind .
not_available You're making a mistake .
not_available It's my mistake to make .
sherry_palmer No , it isn't , David , because you didn't get here by yourself .
president_david_palmer Do not go against me on this , Sherry !
president_david_palmer Promise me .
sherry_palmer I can't promise you anything .
nina_myers Jack , we've got a preliminary read on the trace .
not_available It's a pretty big area .
jack_bauer I'm listening .
nina_myers North of the 10 , east of the 405 .
nina_myers Did you hear me ?
jack_bauer Yeah , that's a start .
jack_bauer Now get me through these cops .
nina_myers Your best bet is east on Thurston .
nina_myers I don't think you should move yet .
jack_bauer I'll get through the net somehow .
jack_bauer Nina , just stay on that trace and help me find my family , please .
nina_myers Tony , open an extra socket for me on 1 .
nina_myers Did you hear me ?
not_available Come here for a second .
not_available You gotta check this out .
not_available What is it ?
tony_almeida I was checking Jamey's disk to see if I could find any e mails .
tony_almeida She was careful about cleaning up , but she didn't have time for this one .
not_available That's from this morning .
tony_almeida To an anonymous recipient .
not_available What about the encryption ?
not_available I'll get Milo on that .
tony_almeida But you can still see the subject .
nina_myers Ted Cofell .
not_available Find out who he is .
not_available I'm busy .
not_available Yeah ?
tony_almeida I need you to do something for me .
not_available I'm working on this trace .
not_available You'll have to do two things at once .
tony_almeida I need this e mail decrypted , all right ?
not_available CTU , Almeida .
not_available Okay .
not_available Thanks .
tony_almeida Nina , that was the clinic .
tony_almeida Jamey didn't make it .
not_available Mom , it's clear .
not_available They're gone .
not_available Hello , Jack ?
not_available Are you there ?
nina_myers Teri , it's Nina .
not_available You okay to talk ?

not_available Jack , I've got Teri .

jack_bauer I'm on my way to get you out of there ,
not_available sweetheart .
not_available You
not_available okay ?
not_available Yeah , I'm hanging in there .
not_available Good , thank God .
jack_bauer Nina's tracing the cellular signal to your location .
not_available How long will that take ?
not_available Nina ?
not_available Twenty minutes .
nina_myers Milo's narrowed the signal to four repeater antennas which is still about 500 square miles .
not_available Oh , God .
nina_myers Teri , don't worry , we're closing in on it .
not_available Please pull over to the curb .
not_available Jack ?
jack_bauer I'm still here , honey .
jack_bauer Is there anything you can tell us that might help us find you ?
teri_bauer I know we're at least a few miles out of the city .
not_available This is gonna take me about a minute .
not_available Hold on .
not_available Jack , are you all right ?
not_available Jack ?
jack_bauer Yeah , I'm fine .
jack_bauer It would really help us out if you could tell us everything you know about where you are .
not_available I don't know much .
teri_bauer They blindfolded me when they picked me up .
not_available Where was that ?
teri_bauer On Mulholland , near Coldwater .
jack_bauer How long did it take for you to get from there to where you are now ?
not_available I'm not sure .
not_available Half an hour ?
jack_bauer Surface streets or freeways ?
not_available Freeways , I think .
not_available Milo .
not_available Already on it .
jack_bauer Anything else , any sounds or smells ?
jack_bauer Can you hear cars or airplanes ?
not_available Anything ?
teri_bauer No , it's pretty quiet .
teri_bauer There's hills , and some eucalyptus trees .
teri_bauer It may be the North Valley , somewhere inland .
not_available It's pretty remote .
not_available That helps .
milo_pressman I've got it narrowed down to three sectors .
milo_pressman The closer we get , the longer each iteration's gonna take .
not_available What does that mean ?
nina_myers It's just techno talk , Teri .
nina_myers Don't worry , we're making good progress .
not_available Jack , are you there ?
not_available Yeah , baby , I'm still here .
jack_bauer Teri , I'm gonna find you .
not_available I promise .
not_available I know you will .
jack_bauer Nina's tracing the call right now .
jack_bauer We're gonna have your location in a couple of minutes
jack_bauer but it's important you don't hang up that phone , okay ?
jack_bauer Even if you can't talk , don't hang up the phone .
jack_bauer Sweetheart , are you sure you're all right ?
not_available They didn't hurt you , did they ?
not_available I'm fine .
not_available So is Kim .
jack_bauer Is she there with you ?
not_available Yeah , she's right here .

not_available Okay .
not_available Dad ?
not_available Hey , sweetheart .
not_available You
not_available okay ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Who are these guys ?
not_available Why are they doing this ?
jack_bauer I don't know honey , but I'm gonna find out , I promise .
jack_bauer Right now I just want to make sure that you and Mommy get home safely , okay ?
jack_bauer Honey , look I know I haven't always been there when you've needed me .
not_available You don't have to do this .
jack_bauer I want both of you to know that I'm here for you now .
jack_bauer I love you more than anything in the whole world and I promise you , I am gonna get you both out of there ,
not_available okay ?
jack_bauer So no matter what happens , don't give up .

not_available He's coming back .
not_available Who's coming ?
not_available Teri , keep the line open .
not_available Dude , it's just a phone .
eli_stram It's how Gaines gets ahold of me when he needs me .
rick_allen You already looked here .
eli_stram Where is it ?
not_available I told you , I don't know .
not_available Where's my phone ?
not_available She doesn't know either .
teri_bauer Stay away from her .

not_available I don't know where your stupid Don't hurt her .
not_available Come on !
not_available Take it easy !
not_available Nina , what's going on ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available The signal's dying .
eli_stram Who'd you call ?
not_available Who is this ?
jack_bauer I'm the last thing that you'll ever see if anything happens to my wife or my daughter .
not_available Where you going ?
eli_stram To tell Gaines they called for help .
rick_allen What do you think he's gonna do when he finds out they used your phone ?
jack_bauer Jack , get us out of here , please .
not_available Hurry !
jack_bauer Teri , I'm going to find you .
jack_bauer I promise .
not_available Think about it .
rick_allen They called on your phone .
not_available Nina .
jack_bauer Tell me you got that trace .
not_available We didn't get it .
cop We've located Bauer's car .
jack_bauer Nina , it's Jack .
not_available You still there ?
not_available What's happening , Jack ?
not_available I got a car .
jack_bauer How close did Milo get with the trace ?
nina_myers Twenty five mile radius .
not_available Damn it , that's not good enough .
not_available Sorry .
not_available Look , I've gotta do something .
jack_bauer Come on , Nina , anything , please help me out .
not_available What about Jamey ?
nina_myers She didn't make it , Jack .
not_available I don't believe this .
jack_bauer Nina , please , I've got to find them .
not_available Hold on .
nina_myers Did you get anything yet with that email address ?
not_available Yeah , it's coming through now .
not_available Patch into Line 2 .
not_available Hey , Jack , it's Tony .
tony_almeida I found something on Jamey's computer that might be a lead .
not_available What ?
tony_almeida The name , Ted Cofell .
tony_almeida I did a search of LA and found Ted Cofell as a CEO of an investment banking firm in Burbank .
not_available That's it ?
not_available So far.
not_available There's something.
not_available Hold on .
not_available Speak one at a time .
not_available Tony , you go first .
not_available So far that's it .
tony_almeida We have Milo decoding the e mail right now .
not_available Fine .
jack_bauer I'm gonna head to Cofell's office .
not_available What's the address ?
jack_bauer It's 21500 Riverside Drive .
jack_bauer Tony , Gaines is gonna probably try to contact Jamey .
not_available He doesn't know she's dead .
jack_bauer Make sure you keep it that way
not_available , okay ?
jack_bauer Nina , you help me navigate through traffic .
not_available All right .
not_available Gaines .
not_available Hello , Ira .
not_available Mr .
not_available Drazen .
not_available Where are you ?
andre_drazen Flying into Los Angeles .
andre_drazen I'd like to know why the David Palmer situation hasn't been taken care of .
andre_drazen I don't have to tell you , my brother and I are very disappointed .
ira_gaines We had some bad luck , that's all .
andre_drazen Bad luck or bad management , we have every reason to void the contract .
not_available There's no need for that .
andre_drazen To have Jack Bauer and David Palmer in the same city on the same day and let them slip through our fingers would be intolerable .
not_available Don't worry .
ira_gaines Palmer will be dead by the end of the day , just as we agreed .
not_available How ?
ira_gaines We still have Bauer's family as leverage .
ira_gaines We'll find Bauer and use him , just like we did before .
andre_drazen If plan 'A' doesn't work , you should have a plan 'B' .
andre_drazen Not plan 'A' recycled .
ira_gaines Like I said , we still have his family .
ira_gaines If we sit tight , there's a good chance Bauer will find us .
ira_gaines Then we'll make him the scapegoat , just as before .
andre_drazen My brother wants me to assess the situation personally .
andre_drazen I land in half an hour .
andre_drazen I'll join you by 10:30 .
not_available Suit yourself .
andre_drazen If I don't see a substantial improvement in things in the next hour I'm going to ask Mr .
andre_drazen Cofell to empty the accounts .
not_available You will get zero .
not_available Mr .
not_available Drazen
andre_drazen You may be in this for the money , but for my family , it's personal .
not_available I realize that .
andre_drazen Then realize this .
andre_drazen If things continue to go wrong the money isn't all you'll lose .
not_available You understand ?
not_available This is Sherry Palmer .
not_available Hello , Sherry .
sherry_palmer I'm sure you're just as surprised as I am that I'm calling you .
carl_webb I'm only surprised you waited this long .
carl_webb I assume you're calling because David still plans to make the announcement about Keith , and you can't stop him .
carl_webb So , now you want me to stop him ?
sherry_palmer You've lost whatever influence you once had with David
sherry_palmer so I'm sure that's gonna be a problem .
sherry_palmer But you might be able to stop Maureen Kingsley .
not_available How ?
not_available I don't know .
sherry_palmer I'm sure she has a weakness somewhere .
sherry_palmer Look , Carl , you don't need to ask me for any advice on stuff like this .
carl_webb As a matter of fact , I've already taken care of the evidence against Keith .
not_available Taken care of it ?
not_available How ?
not_available That's all you really need to know .
sherry_palmer I'm not sure I'm understanding you .
not_available You don't have to .
carl_webb But if we give David a way out of this , make sure he takes it .
not_available Got it .
not_available Send it to me .
milo_pressman A wire transfer to Ira Gaines at 2:10 this morning from a Swiss account : $1,000,000 .
nina_myers What does Cofell have to do with this ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available Maybe it was his money .
not_available It makes sense .
not_available Cofell's in finance .
jack_bauer Yeah , it's Jack .
nina_myers Jack , looks like we have the right Cofell .
not_available Good .
not_available What have you got on him ?
nina_myers All right .
not_available Born in Philadelphia .
not_available Went to Colgate .
nina_myers MBA from UCLA in '88 .
nina_myers Worked in investment banking , started his own firm about five years ago .
nina_myers Net worth is in excess of $35 million .
jack_bauer Okay , good , patch me through to his office .
nancy Cofell Enterprises .
jack_bauer Hi , is Ted there , please ?
not_available Mr .
not_available Cofell's in a meeting .
not_available May I take a message ?
jack_bauer I'm a friend from business school .
not_available I'm in town today .
jack_bauer I was hoping we could get together .
nancy As soon as he's out of the meeting , he's going out of town .
not_available That's too bad .
jack_bauer How much longer will he be in his office ?
nancy He plans to leave by 10:00 .
not_available Would you like to leave your name ?
not_available Hello ?
nina_myers Tell Milo to be ready in case Teri calls back .
not_available Nina , Division gave me a heads up .
tony_almeida They're sending in a provisional replacement for Jack .
not_available They didn't waste any time , did they ?
not_available Who is it ?
not_available Alberta Green .
tony_almeida Didn't she work for you over at Division ?
not_available Yes , she did .
not_available When's she coming ?
tony_almeida Scheduled to arrive at 9:45 .
not_available Okay .
not_available CTU , Myers .
jack_bauer Cofell's there , but he's leaving at 10:00 .
not_available I'm passing Culver .
jack_bauer What's the traffic like moving east ?
not_available Hang on , I'll check .
not_available Jack , there's another thing .
nina_myers They're bringing in Alberta Green to run things .
nina_myers She's gonna be here in a few minutes .
not_available Damn it !
jack_bauer Whatever , look , we'll deal with it .
jack_bauer Tell me how to get out of this traffic .
nina_myers You'll hit gridlock in about two miles .
not_available How is Riverside ?
not_available It's a little better .
not_available You might want to get off .
jack_bauer I'm getting off at the next exit .
not_available I'm gonna cut over .
kim_bauer Mom , tell me what happened between you and Dad .
not_available Why did he move out ?
teri_bauer Kim , let's not talk about this now .
not_available Why not ?
kim_bauer I mean , we both know there might not be a later .
not_available Kim Please , Mom .
kim_bauer I wanna know .
teri_bauer I think your father is the best man that I've ever known .
teri_bauer But he can be difficult and his job doesn't help .
teri_bauer You remember a couple of years ago , when he went away for a few weeks ?
kim_bauer Yeah , for some training thing .
teri_bauer That's what he told us , but I'm sure it was a mission .
teri_bauer He wouldn't say , and maybe he probably couldn't .
teri_bauer Anyway , when he came back , he was different .
teri_bauer He was distant and preoccupied and other times he was just angry .
teri_bauer He did everything he could to keep it from you
teri_bauer but things between us weren't so great .
teri_bauer I suppose I could have been more patient .
teri_bauer So we decided to try being apart .
not_available But it didn't work .
not_available No .
not_available Good .
kim_bauer I just want us to be together again .
tony_almeida Cofell is taking a private plane and we got a copy of his flight plan from the FAA .
not_available He's going to Denver .
not_available What does that tell us ?
not_available We're not sure .
tony_almeida We're checking people in the Denver area who have known terrorist connections .
tony_almeida So far we haven't got much .
alberta_green Hello , Nina .
not_available Hello , Alberta .
not_available Nice to see you .
not_available You know why I'm here .
not_available Yes .
alberta_green Gather everyone around , will you ?
nina_myers Could everyone stop what they're doing for just a moment ?
not_available I have something to tell you .
nina_myers I'd like to introduce you to Alberta Green .
nina_myers Jack Bauer has been relieved of his duties here indefinitely .
nina_myers In the meantime , Alberta's been appointed Acting Director of CTU .
not_available Good morning .
alberta_green Things have been out of control here today .
alberta_green Starting now , they're back in control .
alberta_green Most of you know an attempt was made on Senator Palmer at 8:00 this morning .
alberta_green You may not know that Jack Bauer was apparently involved in that attempt .
alberta_green The nature of his involvement isn't clear but he has escaped custody , and is considered a fugitive .
alberta_green We therefore have two objectives : Find Jack Bauer , and make a quick and accurate assessment of the threat , if any , facing Senator Palmer .
alberta_green I know most of you have been up more than 24 hours .
not_available Too bad .
alberta_green Nobody so much as yawns until we accomplish our objective .
alberta_green If anyone has a problem with that , now would be a good time to resign .
not_available Good .
not_available Let's get back to work .
alberta_green Specific assignments will be confirmed or revised within the hour .
alberta_green Obviously this is awkward , but we'll get through this .
not_available We're pros .
nina_myers Of course .
not_available We'll talk later .
not_available Hold on a minute .
not_available Is it true
kid you played basketball ?
not_available I sure did .
not_available Georgetown .
kid My daddy says Georgetown sucks !
president_david_palmer I need to have a little talk with your daddy .
kid My daddy also says there will never be a black president in this country .
not_available Ever .
president_david_palmer Would you give your daddy a message for me ?
president_david_palmer You tell him I understand where he's coming from , but he's wrong
president_david_palmer and I'm gonna prove it .
not_available Tell him that
not_available , okay ?
not_available Okay .
mike_novick I have Frank Ames on the phone .
not_available What does he want ?
not_available He wouldn't tell me .
not_available I'll call him back .
not_available He said it was urgent .
mike_novick He's your biggest contributor .
mike_novick You can't just blow him off .
not_available I am very sorry .
president_david_palmer Would you excuse me for a minute ?
not_available Senator .
not_available Frank ?
not_available This is kind of a bad time .
frank_ames Well , it's about to get worse .
not_available What do you mean ?
frank_ames I just got out of a meeting with Carl , Phil Tuttle and Bob Jorgensen .
not_available A meeting about what ?
frank_ames George Ferragamo , your son's therapist .
president_david_palmer I know the three of you have given a lot of money to my campaign but
president_david_palmer that doesn't make my son's therapist your business .
frank_ames It is when he's accusing your son of murder .

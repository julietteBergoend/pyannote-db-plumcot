not_available Right now terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate .
not_available My wife and daughter have been targeted and people that I work with may be involved in both .
not_available I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer and today is the longest day of my life .
not_available We will .
not_available Maybe you're right .
not_available Maybe she drowned .
not_available It does not matter as long as Bauer believes his daughter is here .
not_available Stop !
not_available Stop , please !
not_available At this time , we do not have any information as to the cause of the explosion that killed Senator David Palmer .
not_available Do you have any idea what's going on out there ?
not_available Since no one has seen a body the media is circulating all kinds of rumors .
not_available I will tell them as soon as I have confirmation that Jack Bauer's daughter is safe .
not_available And then what , David ?
not_available You're going to play dead
not_available and I'm supposed to hide here and play the grieving widow ?
not_available Just how long do you think we can keep that charade up ?
not_available For as long as we have to .
not_available That's crazy !
not_available Mike , tell him how crazy it is .
not_available He listens to you .
not_available Don't put me in the middle .
not_available What , isn't that your job , to be in the middle ?
not_available For crying out loud , Mike .
not_available It's your career on the line , too .
not_available You came clean on TV today .
not_available You got lucky .
not_available But it could just as easily have gone the other way .
not_available Testing the public's patience like that ?
not_available You won't be lucky again , David .
not_available Listen to me .
not_available Jack Bauer saved my life today .
not_available Not once , but twice .
not_available I realize that and I am sympathetic to what heI don't think you are !
not_available I am .
not_available Listen to me
not_available No !
not_available I am going to respect his request and so are you .
not_available You will not sacrifice his daughter .
not_available Anything new ?
not_available I'm just going over the intel from Langley .
not_available I mean about Jack .
not_available CTU , Almeida .
not_available I assume you still haven't heard anything from him .
not_available Not yet .
not_available George .
not_available I've got Highway Patrol on Line 7 .
not_available They picked up a girl at the port , says she's Jack's daughter .
not_available Patch it through .
not_available This is George Mason , CTU .
not_available Who am I speaking with ?
not_available Sergeant Devlin , Highway Patrol .
not_available I hear you have a young woman with you .
not_available Claims
not_available she's the daughter of your agent .
not_available Jack Bauer ?
not_available That's right .
not_available Can I speak with her , please ?
not_available Hello ?
not_available Kim , this is George Mason at CTU .
not_available How are you ?
not_available Okay ?
not_available Yes .
not_available Tell my father that I've escaped or he'll go there
not_available and they'll kill him .
not_available Can you tell us where these people are , Kim ?
not_available The port .
not_available I don't know exactly .
not_available May I speak with the Sergeant ?
not_available Okay .
not_available We picked her up near Dock 11 Alpha .
not_available Send two tactical teams .
not_available Highest priority .
not_available Have law enforcement establish a perimeter .
not_available Where are you now , Sergeant ?
not_available North of the harbor .
not_available All right , get Kim over here
not_available ASAP ,
not_available all right ?
not_available We've got to find Jack before he walks into a trap .
not_available We need to coordinate two .
not_available Yes .
not_available What's taking so long ?
not_available I just got here .
not_available Where exactly ?
not_available Don't worry .
not_available I'm close enough .
not_available Where's my daughter ?
not_available She's right here .
not_available Put her on the phone .
not_available Come to the parking lot of the freight office .
not_available I'll come out with her .
not_available Let me speak to her first .
not_available There's been enough talking .
not_available After what's happened today , you expect me to trust you ?
not_available We know you lied about Palmer being dead so don't talk about trust ,
not_available all right ?
not_available Just get down here now
not_available or I'll kill her myself .
not_available Trust that .
not_available I'm not going to show myself until I speak to my daughter first .
not_available Don't test me .
not_available Bauer !
not_available He's not coming .
not_available He's coming .
not_available Nina , what's the ETA on the TAC teams ?
not_available Five on the Alpha , eight on the Beta .
not_available Myers .
not_available Nina , it's me .
not_available Where are you ?
not_available Listen carefully .
not_available I've just confirmed that someone at CTU is feeding the Drazens information .
not_available Based on what ?
not_available They know that Palmer wasn't killed .
not_available Who at CTU had clearance for that kind of intel ?
not_available Besides me , just Tony , Mason and Chappelle .
not_available One of those three is working for them .
not_available You need to find out which one .
not_available Okay .
not_available But Jack , what are you doing ?
not_available Where are you ?
not_available Andre agreed to a trade , me for Kim .
not_available Are you just going to walk right up to them ?
not_available If I can guarantee Kim's safety , yes .
not_available Nina , there's a chance that I won't be able to see this thing through .
not_available Until you know who's giving the Drazens information don't trust anyone .
not_available I've got to go .
not_available I don't think the situation will require much spin as long as you do what you've been doing all along .
not_available Tell me again what I've been doing , Mike ?
not_available Telling the truth .
not_available And tearing my family apart in the process .
not_available As hard as it's been for everyone
not_available I think this last day has been about finding out who you really are not just as a candidate .
not_available Yeah .
not_available Mike , turn on the TV .
not_available What is it , Mike ?
not_available A reliable source from inside Palmer's campaign confirmed just moments ago the Senator was unharmed by the blast .
not_available Damn it !
not_available What is still uncertain is why the Senator has not made a statement .
not_available Sherry .
not_available David .
not_available We have to deal with the press , David .
not_available David !
not_available You couldn't wait to leak it to the press , could you ?
not_available David , I
not_available It was you !
not_available What were you thinking ?
not_available They already knew .
not_available Damn it , Sherry !
not_available The way you keep defying me !
not_available I'm not defying you , I am protecting you !
not_available Protecting me from what ?
not_available Mike !
not_available Back off , David .
not_available I mean it .
not_available Get off me .
not_available I mean it !
not_available Get off me !
not_available Back off !
not_available David !
not_available You have to talk to the press , now .
not_available The longer you take to make a statement , the more control you give up .
not_available Damn it !
not_available If that child dies !
not_available Yes ?
not_available It's me .
not_available I'm busy .
not_available What's happening ?
not_available They found his daughter .
not_available She'll be here within the hour .
not_available Does Bauer know ?
not_available No .
not_available Not yet .
not_available I'm the only one in contact with him .
not_available I've been ordered by CTU to send in two teams .
not_available They're on their way .
not_available All right , hold on .
not_available They found the girl .
not_available Bauer doesn't know .
not_available The CTU people are already on their way .
not_available We have to get you out of here .
not_available He won't come if we can't produce the girl .
not_available He's not stupid .
not_available Father , we barely have time to get to international waters .
not_available I can't risk you getting captured again .
not_available Give me the phone .
not_available Can you contact Bauer ?
not_available Yes .
not_available You tell him his daughter is dead .
not_available Her body was found floating in the harbor .
not_available You think he'll come after you ?
not_available Yes .
not_available You'll have to kill him .
not_available No mistakes .
not_available If he finds out I've lied to him , my cover will be blown .
not_available Of course we will kill him .
not_available That is the point .
not_available He's coming .
not_available Andre ?
not_available No .
not_available It's me .
not_available Come back to CTU .
not_available I can't .
not_available I'm running out of time .
not_available I'm going to get Kim now .
not_available I don't know how to tell you this .
not_available What is it , Nina ?
not_available Coast Guard Cutter answered the APB we put out on Kim .
not_available They found her body , Jack .
not_available What ?
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available She's dead .
not_available No .
not_available I'm so sorry .
not_available Jack ?
not_available What if Bauer doesn't come ?
not_available He may be too crushed by the thought of his daughter's death .
not_available That is exactly why he will come .
not_available Believe me .
not_available I know .
not_available Go !
not_available Hurry , Father , get to the boat .
not_available It has come to my attention that misinformation was given to the press .
not_available And again , I apologize for the misunderstanding .
not_available As you can imagine , this has been a very chaotic situation .
not_available But I appreciate the confidence the voters have continued to show for our campaign .
not_available We regret that false information has been broadcast regarding this incident .
not_available But , thankfully , no one was hurt .
not_available My family and I are safe , and we have no intention of letting this slow us down in any way .
not_available Are you coming here to lecture me , Mike ?
not_available Lecture you on what ?
not_available About how I'm not being supportive enough for David .
not_available Actually , I'm on your side this time .
not_available I think David was hurting himself with this charade .
not_available Maybe it's good you leaked the truth to the press .
not_available I want to know what this entire day has done to his campaign .
not_available I think we should run some focus groups first thing in the morning .
not_available I've already called Robin over at ASl .
not_available Okay , good .
not_available Do you think David should cancel his trip to Dallas , go back to Washington ?
not_available I don't know , Sherry .
not_available I think David should make that call .
not_available No , I don't .
not_available David's in no frame of mind to make critical decisions right now .
not_available It's going to take you
not_available and I
not_available to steer this thing by ourselves ,
not_available okay until he gets his head screwed on right .
not_available Listen , Sherry David wanted to meet with you privately when he finished his statement .
not_available David doesn't need to make an appointment to see me .
not_available I'm right here .
not_available He'll be in the ballroom in five minutes .
not_available I've already called the Secret Service .
not_available What's this all about ?
not_available He didn't say .
not_available If I were you
not_available I'd take it as an opportunity to make the first move .
not_available Patch things up .
not_available Make things right .
not_available Fine , Mike .
not_available That's too much .
not_available Tony , get this .
not_available Okay , I'll call you back .
not_available The TAC team got there , but Jack went in without them .
not_available By himself? .
not_available Evidently .
not_available Is he all right ?
not_available He's alive .
not_available What about the Drazens ?
not_available What are you talking about ?
not_available Dead .
not_available Congratulations , Teri .
not_available Your family's fine .
not_available They're on their way over here now .
not_available Anyway , Karris counts seven down .
not_available Jack's the last man standing .
not_available Want to contact Secret Service .
not_available I'll update Division ?
not_available I talked to Jack an hour ago .
not_available He said Teri , I told you everybody's fine .

not_available Are you sure ?
not_available Positive .
not_available What about the men that were after Kim and me ?

not_available You and Kim are safe .
not_available And so is Jack .
not_available Okay .
not_available I just want us all to be back together again , I guess .
not_available It won't be long .
not_available Thank God .
not_available I'm sorry , I still have a lot of work to do .
not_available So if there's nothing else
not_available There is , actually .
not_available Um This is a little awkward , Nina , but It's my guess that you still have feelings for Jack , and now that we're together again and we're going to have a baby Teri
not_available As soon as this is over , I plan to have myself tranferred out of this office .
not_available Really ?
not_available Yes .

sherry_palmer How did you get past Secret Service ?
not_available Good to see you too , Sherry .
not_available You listen .
sherry_palmer David has to prep for a breakfast meeting .
not_available And the polls are opening in an hour , so whatever you're doing David asked me to come .
not_available Why , Carl ?
not_available I don't know .
sherry_palmer I gotta get ready , and so do you .
carl_webb So , what's the big emergency , David ?
carl_webb Thought we had a game plan .
not_available We did .
president_david_palmer Until I found out that my son lied to me .
president_david_palmer That he's been lying for seven years .
carl_webb What's going on ?
president_david_palmer Why would Maureen Kingsley run a story this big unless it were true ?
carl_webb Are you saying you believe her accusation about Keith ?
president_david_palmer I'm saying , my son was involved in Gibson's death and you covered it up .
president_david_palmer Not only from the law , from me .
not_available David.
president_david_palmer Someone altered the hospital records to make it look like Keith wasn't involved .
president_david_palmer That could only have been you .
president_david_palmer Look me in the eye and tell me what happened .
carl_webb You sure you want to know ?
carl_webb You might not like what you find if you open that door .
not_available It's already open .
not_available I'm listening .
carl_webb The night Gibson raped Nicole while Sherry was still at the hospital and you were flying back
carl_webb Keith went to see Gibson .
not_available How do you know this ?
not_available Keith told me .
carl_webb Your son came to me , David .
carl_webb He said Gibson pulled a knife .
carl_webb I took him at his word .
not_available It was an accident .
not_available He was defending himself .
president_david_palmer So you made it look likeKeith was never there .
carl_webb As far as I was concerned , he never was .
president_david_palmer Why didn't we just go to the police ?
president_david_palmer If it really was self defense , Keith would have been cleared .
not_available Maybe .
carl_webb But your career would have been over .
carl_webb Gibson was white , David .
president_david_palmer I still wouldn't have covered it up .
not_available Are you so sure ?
president_david_palmer It was my decision , not yours .
president_david_palmer I don't want you anywhere near me or my family , ever again .
carl_webb You have never needed me more than you need me now .
not_available Get out .
carl_webb Before you finish crucifying me save some nails for your wife .
president_david_palmer Sherry didn't know anything about this .
not_available No ?
carl_webb How do you think Keith got to me in the first place ?
not_available What are you doing ?
kim_bauer What does it look like ?
rick_allen I said , I don't need.
not_available I heard .
rick_allen You think I wanted to leave Janet there ?
not_available Everything just got so crazy .
rick_allen All we had to do was hang out with you guys .
not_available No one was supposed to get hurt .
rick_allen None of this was supposed to go down .
not_available What did you think was gonna happen ?
rick_allen I don't know .
not_available Smoking that's really gonna help .
rick_allen I can't believe this is happening .
kim_bauer It is , and you can sit there feeling sorry for yourself
kim_bauer or you can get up and help me figure out a way to get us out of here .
not_available West Side .
not_available Copy that .
claude_davenport Claude Davenport , Hospital Security .

jack_bauer When she's up to it , I'm going to need to ask her a few questions .
alan_york Jack , my daughter's been through a lot .
alan_york If the doctor says it's okay .
jack_bauer The guys that Kim and Janet were with tonight Teri told me you didn't know them .

not_available She's my daughter .
jack_bauer But , you don't know who she goes out with on a school night ?
not_available Jack ?
alan_york No , not tonight , I didn't .
alan_york But apparently you didn't either .
not_available What are you doing ?
jack_bauer Trying to find where our daughter is .
teri_bauer By treating Alan as a suspect ?
jack_bauer He can handle a few questions .
not_available Now , you understand that right ?
not_available Our daughter's still missing .
alan_york Of course I do .
teri_bauer Alan , would you excuse us for a minute , please ?
not_available Jack , what's going on ?
teri_bauer I don't know what you've been doing for the last five hours , but Alan was with me tonight .
teri_bauer I'm sorry if that makes you feel bad Hold on one minute .
not_available I'm here to see my brother .
not_available My bag ?
not_available I'm not gonna open my briefcase .

president_david_palmer That he went to Carl to cover up the Gibson boy's death .
not_available Keith was there , wasn't he ?
sherry_palmer Just because Carl wants to feed you
not_available some story doesn't meanAre you sure you're not the one that's feeding me the story ?
president_david_palmer The thing I can't understand , what I keep asking myself is why you hid this from me ?
sherry_palmer I wanted to tell you , David , I.
not_available > .
not_available But you didn't .
not_available Carl said you'd be exposed !
president_david_palmer Don't put this on Carl !
president_david_palmer You keep your own counsel , Sherry .
not_available You always have .
sherry_palmer Nothing I say to you is going to make you feel any better , I know that .
sherry_palmer I did what I thought was right , for our family and for your career .
president_david_palmer What about Nicole ?
not_available Does she know , too ?
sherry_palmer We were protecting you .
not_available Really ?
not_available Yes .
president_david_palmer Or protecting your chance to move into the White House ?
sherry_palmer I am as ambitious as you are , David .
sherry_palmer That's why you married me .
president_david_palmer No , I married you because I loved you .
president_david_palmer I thought we were working towards something together .
not_available We still are .
president_david_palmer It doesn't feel that way .
not_available David .
sherry_palmer David , what are you going to do ?
not_available I don't know .
sherry_palmer David , you can be as angry at me as you want .
sherry_palmer But I'm telling you , we should do everything we can to keep this thing from coming out .
president_david_palmer It's too late for that .
sherry_palmer I'm sorry to hear you say that because you'll lose a lot more than the election if it does .
sherry_palmer Are you prepared to send our son to jail ?
rick_allen Everything was always a game with Dan .
rick_allen He acted like nothing could touch him .
rick_allen And I bought into it .
not_available So did Janet .
rick_allen I'd give anything to turn back the clock .
not_available Me , too .
kim_bauer I spend every day trying to get away from my mother .
kim_bauer Now I can't stop wishing she were here .
not_available God , she must be freaking .
rick_allen Must be nice , having a mom you like .
not_available You don't like yours ?
rick_allen Not all women are meant to be mothers .

not_available Rick .
not_available We've got to get out of here .
not_available Come with me .
not_available Let's go .
ira_gaines Leave the shovel , unless you plan to use it on me .
ira_gaines When I come back , your friend better be in the ground .
not_available Myers .
not_available Any word on the John Doe yet ?
nina_myers Perry estimates the time of death between 11:00 and 12:00 last night .
jack_bauer Before we were tipped on the Palmer hit .
not_available Is he close to making an ID ?
nina_myers We did sent some tissue samples to the lab .
nina_myers They're running his DNA against all databases .
not_available No , that will take too long .
nina_myers We're going as fast as we can , Jack .
jack_bauer Put Jamey on it , we've got to take care of this now .
not_available Did you find Kim ?
not_available No , not yet .
not_available Is her friend all right ?
not_available She will be .
not_available How about Teri ?
not_available How's she holding up ?
not_available She's fine , Nina .
jack_bauer What else is going on over there ?
teri_bauer I think I have to apologize for Jack .
alan_york You don't have to apologize for your husband .
alan_york We're all pretty wound up .
teri_bauer Jack's wound up a little tighter than the rest of us .
not_available No argument here .
teri_bauer I guess I've always accepted it as an occupational hazard .
alan_york I thought you told me that he sat behind a desk .
teri_bauer The truth is , half the time I don't know what he's doing .
teri_bauer He can't tell me .
not_available It's a security thing .
alan_york Must be tough on you .
not_available Sometimes .
alan_york But you deal with it .
teri_bauer Right now , he's just worried about Kim .
alan_york Hopefully , when Janet wakes up , she'll be able to tell us where she is .
not_available Yeah .
not_available Look , I gotta go .
jack_bauer Call me back as soon as you've got anything .
jack_bauer Walk with me for a sec .
not_available What is it , Jack ?
teri_bauer Why is there all this security here ?
teri_bauer Who wants to hurt Janet ?
jack_bauer Today someone is going to try to kill David Palmer .
not_available What ?
jack_bauer That's why I was brought in last night .
teri_bauer Why is Janet in danger ?
jack_bauer Because she was with Kim .
not_available Our daughter's missing .
teri_bauer Are you saying it relates to an assassination attempt ?
jack_bauer They must know that I've been assigned to protect Palmer .
teri_bauer And you think this person kidnapped Kim ?
not_available Oh , my God .
jack_bauer I'm so sorry .
jack_bauer I know this is all happening because of me .
jack_bauer I've tried to keep a wall between my work and my family .
jack_bauer The wall's coming down , and now I don't know what to do .
not_available Okay .
not_available What do they want from you ?
not_available I don't know yet .
teri_bauer What are the police doing ?
not_available I couldn't call them .
not_available I can't without risking Kim's life .
not_available What if it's too late ?
not_available It's not too late .
not_available Kim is okay .
jack_bauer They took her for a reason , and that was not to hurt her .
not_available Okay .
jack_bauer Honey I promise you , we are going to get her back .
not_available I'm so sorry .
not_available I need you in forensics .
jamey_farrell I'm about to crack the outer shell .
nina_myers You said that two hours ago .
jamey_farrell This keycard is our best lead on the Palmer hit .
nina_myers I'm not dropping the keycard .
not_available I've called in Milo .
jamey_farrell Milo's an outside contractor .
nina_myers Which is why we can trust him .
not_available I can do this .
not_available I'm as good as Milo .
nina_myers Not with this kind of thing you're not , and I can't wait .
nina_myers Jack wants you on this .
not_available I'll brief you on the way .
nina_myers He thinks it's a male Caucasian .
not_available Who is it ?
not_available David .
president_david_palmer Sorry to wake you like this , Mike , but something's come up .
president_david_palmer I was hoping to keep you out of it .
mike_novick I'm your Chief of Staff , David .
mike_novick I shouldn't be kept out of anything .
not_available It was a private matter .
not_available You're running for president .
not_available Nothing's private any more .
not_available Where you going ?
alan_york They moved Janet upstairs to the ICU .
not_available She's out of recovery ?
alan_york She's a little groggy , but she's awake .
not_available Alan , that's wonderful .
not_available Yeah , thank you .
not_available Alan , I owe you an apology .
jack_bauer I'm sorry .
not_available You don't need to be .
alan_york I understand exactly what you're going through .
not_available Excuse me .
not_available Bauer .
not_available We found something .
nina_myers X rays show a surgical pin in John Doe's ankle .
not_available Turns out it's not standard .
nina_myers It's custommade , oneofa kind .
jack_bauer That means we can trace it to the surgeon who implanted it .
nina_myers Jamey's searching the AMA database , crosschecking it with the manufacturer .
nina_myers Hopefully , we'll have this guy's name within the hour .
not_available Sooner is better .
not_available I gotta go .
not_available Call me as soon as you've got something .
mike_novick The minute Maureen breaks the story , you'll free fall in the polls .
mike_novick Then the media will start churning this thing , 24/7 .
mike_novick They'll pick you clean , then go to work on the bones .
mike_novick Chances are , the party will try to cut bait .
mike_novick So I'd say you're textbook unelectable .
president_david_palmer So I'm right to withdraw from the race .
mike_novick No , that's the last thing you should do .
president_david_palmer You just got through telling me I can't win .
mike_novick I told you what to expect so you can .
mike_novick If we handle this right , I think you can come back from this .
not_available David .
mike_novick You're the most important presidential candidate this country's had in a long time .
mike_novick Like it or not , fair or not , you're making history .
president_david_palmer My son was involved in another man's death .
not_available It was an accident .
president_david_palmer Okay , then what if some judge rules it was
president_david_palmer How do we justify the cover up ?
president_david_palmer All of them Sherry , Keith , Nicole kept this from the police .
mike_novick I don't want to seem crass , but the important thing is you didn't cover it up .
mike_novick You didn't know .
president_david_palmer What does that say about me ?
president_david_palmer Not knowing the most important things about my family .
mike_novick I'm not saying it's not a hard sell .
mike_novick The election is still six months away .
mike_novick The voters know how to forgive .
mike_novick You just have to know how to ask for it .
mike_novick Do you still want the job , David ?
not_available You know I do .
mike_novick Then you need to come out with the story yourself before Maureen Kingsley .
mike_novick Make it the first thing you say at the breakfast .
president_david_palmer I just don't know how my family's going to feel about that .
mike_novick Find out fast , because you can't do this without them .
mike_novick When you come clean be damned sure your family is standing next to you .
susan_collier I did an extensive neurological exam which showed no spinal injury .
susan_collier She suffered multiple fractures , but nothing she can't recover from .
alan_york What went wrong in surgery ?
susan_collier When they tried to stop internal bleeding , she had a cardiac arrest .
susan_collier It happens sometimes .
not_available But she's okay now ?
susan_collier The next six hours will be critical , but I'm optimistic .
jack_bauer Is it be possible to ask her a few questions ?
not_available When ?
not_available As soon as possible .
teri_bauer Our daughter's missing and Janet was the last person to see her .
susan_collier I'm not comfortable with her being interrogated .
jack_bauer I'm just talking about asking her one or two questions .
susan_collier I'll leave it up to her father .
alan_york Let me go in first , make sure she's up to it .
not_available Thank you .
jack_bauer You know what we should do when this is over ?
not_available Get some sleep ?
jack_bauer We should take that trip we always talked about .

not_available Just the three of us .
teri_bauer That sounds nice .
not_available I'm sorry , Nina's following up a lead .
not_available That was quick .
ira_gaines Do what I tell you , Jack , and you might see your daughter again .
ira_gaines Say yes if you understand me .
not_available Answer me , Jack .
not_available Yes .
ira_gaines Now smile at your wife like nothing's wrong and move away from the doors .
ira_gaines That's right , we're watching you .
ira_gaines Walk away now , or Kimberly gets a bullet in her head .
jack_bauer The reception is really bad here .
teri_bauer I'll be right back .
ira_gaines Now continue down the hall .
ira_gaines Come on Jack , I don't have all day .
jack_bauer What do you want me to do ?
ira_gaines Go out the north entrance .
not_available Left .
ira_gaines Yes , I'm still watching you .
ira_gaines Let's head out the north entrance .

not_available Do you mind ?
not_available Daddy ?
not_available Hello , Janet .
alan_york You've had a rough night , haven't you ?
not_available Who are you ?
not_available Where's my father ?
not_available Where am I going ?
ira_gaines On your left , there's a silver Taurus .
not_available I see it .
not_available Get in .
ira_gaines Open the glove compartment .
jack_bauer First prove to me that my daughter is still alive .
not_available Daddy ?
not_available Kimberly ?
not_available Are you okay ?
kim_bauer Yeah , they haven't hurt me , but I'm
ira_gaines There's a metal box inside the glove compartment .
not_available Take it out .
not_available Tuck it in your ear .
not_available Now say something .
jack_bauer If you hurt my daughter , I will kill you .
not_available Good .
ira_gaines There's a nice , clear signal .

not_available Lose it out the window .

teri_bauer Jack , where are you ?
not_available Sorry .

not_available He went to take a call I need to talk to him .
teri_bauer Why , what did Janet say ?
not_available Does she know something ?
not_available They were trying to escape .
not_available Escape from whom ?
alan_york A couple of boys who got too aggressive .
alan_york She doesn't know if Kim got away .
teri_bauer Kim would have called if she did .
alan_york Janet says that they were being held in a house up in Bel Air .
not_available That's the address ?
not_available We should give it to the police .
teri_bauer Jack is the police .
teri_bauer Jack , pick up .
jack_bauer This is Jack Bauer .
not_available Leave a message .
not_available He's not answering .
teri_bauer Jack , listen , it's me again .
teri_bauer Janet may know where Kimberly is .
teri_bauer Would you please call me as soon as you get this , okay ?
not_available Jack ?
not_available He was just here .
teri_bauer He promised me he wouldn't leave .
alan_york Keep trying him on his cell .
not_available I'll call the police .
not_available No , I have to get there .
alan_york If you want , I'll take you .
not_available Well , what about Janet ?
not_available She's sleeping .

not_available How ?
not_available Gaines put me on the phone with him .

not_available He'll find us .
not_available What's up , Milo ?
milo_pressman Did you try using an S box inversion on that keycard ?
not_available No .
not_available Why ?
milo_pressman I don't know , it's just the fastest way into a file that size .

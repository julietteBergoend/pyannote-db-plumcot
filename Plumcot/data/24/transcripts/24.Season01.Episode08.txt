
not_available Right now, terrorists are plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate.
not_available My teenage daughter is missing.
not_available And people that I work with may be involved in both.
not_available I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.
not_available Today is going to be the longest day of my life.
not_available It is just after 7:00 a.<br>m.
not_available on the West Coast and the California Primary is now officially underway.
not_available We're here outside the San Clarita Power Plant in Los Angeles where Senator David Palmer will be addressing local labor leaders and some members of the state energy council.
not_available The senator has pledged support for renovations that would advance this power plant to production.
not_available Yeah? Bauer's on his way.
not_available Are you in yet? 
not_available Just about.
not_available Good.
not_available create thousands of new jobs.
not_available This promises to be a landmark day as it is expected that Senator Palmer will get the delegates he needs to become the first African
not_available American presidential candidate of a major political party.
not_available Of the 11 states that will be looking for delegates today California is expected to be crucial.
not_available And most of the polls say that David Palmer will win by a decisive margin.
not_available Have you decided? I've rewritten the speech I was going to give this morning.
not_available I'm going to tell them about Keith.
not_available What are you going to say? The truth.
not_available That seven years ago he was involved in an accidental death.
not_available I need you to stand by me, Sherry.
not_available It's the only way to protect Keith.
not_available For the man seen as the best hope for their country's financial future.
not_available I will never forgive you if something bad happens to my son.
not_available He's my son, too.
not_available We'll get through this.
not_available I hope so, David.
not_available We caught up with some voters who started lining up at 6:00 a.
not_available m.
not_available Hey, ma.
not_available Good morning, honey.
not_available Where's your sister? Oh, she changed her mind.
not_available She's not going.
not_available Really? Yeah, she went to the airport to pick up Susie and Rachel instead.
not_available Oh, that's right.
not_available The Brenner girls are flying in.
not_available So, uh.
not_available what's gonna to happen this morning? We have to put this thing behind us, Keith.
not_available By me being in prison and you in the Oval Office? Is that how we're going to put it behind us? You're not going to prison.
not_available You didn't do anything wrong.
not_available That's not how a jury will see it.
not_available Why don't you just have a little faith in the system? What's this fairy tale that you're living in? The world's going to believe that I killed a white kid who raped my sister.
not_available Do you think that anyone will believe it was an accident? Yes, I do.
not_available Then you're a fool.
not_available Keith, no.
not_available No, that's all right.
not_available You talk about fairy tales.
not_available You think you can run from this? You think it's going to make things better? I'm not running anywhere.
not_available I'd just rather not spend my last hour of freedom with you.
not_available Let's go and get this over with.
not_available Martin Belkin? Yes.
not_available Hi, I'm Jessica Abrams.
not_available I work for Senator Palmer.
not_available Hi.
not_available Pleasure to meet you.
not_available Can I help you with.<br>.
not_available I got it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Great.
not_available Follow me.
not_available Is the senator here yet? Not yet, but he is on his way.
not_available Great.
not_available I am a huge fan of your work.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Right this way, please.
not_available Hi.
not_available I'm going to be taking some photographs of the senator.
not_available I need a check on a Belkin: BELKI
not_available N.

not_available Clear on Belkin.
not_available All right, copy that.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You can go in.
not_available Turn right at the light.
not_available You see the bus stop on your left? Yes.
not_available Pull over to it.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available How are you doing? Don't touch it until I tell you to.
not_available Now, go.
not_available I'm not going anywhere until I can talk to my wife and my daughter.
not_available Oh, you'll do this, because it really isn't an inconvenience for me to hurt your daughter.
not_available Or your wife, for that matter.
not_available In fact, here she is.
not_available Would you like to speak to your husband? Say anything you want.
not_available Tell him you love him.
not_available Jack.
not_available Teri? I don't know where I am yet, and I haven't seen Kimberly
not_available You were saying, Jack, you're not sure you wanted to do this? That's what I thought.
not_available San Clarita Power Station.
not_available This is only temporary, Mrs.
not_available Bauer.
not_available If Jack follows instructions, you'll be released within the hour.
not_available Where's my daughter? She's here and she's safe.
not_available Could you take me to her, please? 
not_available Hey.
not_available What, Milo? What happened to Nina? 
not_available She got called out.
not_available What am I supposed to do about this keycard? Because this was supposed to be the most important thing we're doing.
not_available They brought me in here on the highest priority and now I'm just sitting around.
not_available I think Nina's got some new intel that preempts this.
not_available That's why she had to run out.
not_available So, what should I be doing? Why don't you help me format some files? They didn't bring me in here at 5:00 a.<br>m.
not_available to format files! Does this kid Milo know he's working on the wrong keycard? Is this going to be a problem? Nina Myers is dead.
not_available Make up a story for why she's not there.
not_available Mom! 
not_available Kimberly! It's okay.
not_available It's okay, honey.
not_available Where's Dad? I don't know.
not_available He knows we're in trouble? Yeah, he does.
not_available He's doing everything he can, baby.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available No, no, no, no.
not_available it's not your fault.
not_available It's not your fault, honey.
not_available Why don't you tell me about these boys? I met them through Janet, and She started dating this guy, Dan and his friend Rick came into town and we just hang out and oh, God.
not_available They kept you here the whole time? Yes.
not_available Janet was hit by a car.
not_available I know.
not_available You do? We are going to get through this.
not_available I promise you.
not_available Hello? Come on, Jamey! Pick up! 
not_available Almeida.
not_available Tony.
not_available Nina, where've you been? I can't get into it.
not_available Well, force yourself.
not_available Where are you? Just east of downtown.
not_available What are you doing there? Tony, you have to listen to me carefully.
not_available No one at CTU can know I'm alive.
not_available Who would think you were dead? I can't tell you any more right now.
not_available Where's Jamey? She's working with Milo.
not_available Get her for me.
not_available No, not until you tell me what's going on.
not_available Please, Tony.
not_available This is an order.
not_available I need your help.
not_available All right.
not_available Threatening emails, hate mail for Palmer.
not_available This is a giant waste of time.
not_available When is Nina coming back? Probably not for a couple of hours.
not_available What makes you say that? I just talked to her.
not_available When? A couple minutes ago.
not_available She's at Division.
not_available It's possible she'll be there all day.
not_available What do you need? Never mind.
not_available Look, if somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now.<br>.
not_available I'm going to Chapelle.
not_available I told you, I have to speak to Jamey.
not_available Yes, and I just heard her tell Milo that you'll be at Division all day.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What? 
not_available Who did she hear that from? She said she talked to you minutes ago.
not_available Nina, what is going on? We can't trust Jamey.
not_available Jack said CTU had been infiltrated.
not_available Are you saying Jamey's a spy? Why else would she lie? She must think I'm dead.
not_available Why would she think that? I'll explain later.
not_available You have to bring me back in now.
not_available Okay, I'll come get you.
not_available No, stay there.
not_available Act as if everything is all right.
not_available Jack was behaving very strangely back at CTU.
not_available These people must be watching us.
not_available I don't know, probably through our own surveillance.
not_available All right, look.
not_available I'll send a car.
not_available What's your address? Senator.
not_available How are you? Copy that.
not_available GAll you have to do now Jack, is get through security.
not_available Jack Bauer, CTU.
not_available I've been cleared by Frank Simes.
not_available All right, I'll need you to open the case.
not_available Sure.
not_available What do you need a laptop for? Everything that we've compiled on Palmer over the last eight hours is in there.
not_available You want to lift that up, please? Turn it on.
not_available Press any two buttons.
not_available All right, go ahead.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Where is Senator Palmer now? He's on his way up.
not_available Good.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Jack Bauer? Jessica Abrams? Yeah, Hi.
not_available What are you doing here? I'm working security.
not_available How many years has it been? Since high school? Yes.
not_available I'm sorry, I've got to get going.
not_available Are you still racing motorcycles? Keep moving, Jack.
not_available Not since my daughter was born.
not_available I'd like to catch up.
not_available Maybe later.
not_available I've just got to get going.
not_available Great, I'll be here.
not_available Okay.
not_available What do I do now? You'll hand the briefcase to one of our people.
not_available Who? I'll tell you when it's time.
not_available Go wait by the buffet table.
not_available But now our election coverage shifts to the polls.
not_available Back east, we've had some interesting developments.
not_available Good to see you.
not_available Senator, I'd like you to meet Martin Belkin.
not_available Good you could make it, Martin.
not_available Jessica says you're the best.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I look forward to working with you.
not_available Honey, you're so tired.
not_available Hi.
not_available I brought you some breakfast.
not_available Is Kim okay? Who are you? Rick.
not_available You kidnapped my daughter.
not_available I didn't know.
not_available How could you not know? I tried to help her get out, okay? Gaines wants to go over some things with us.
not_available What's going on here, Rick? Nothing.
not_available Don't make friends.
not_available I wasn't.
not_available Good, they ain't gonna be around much longer.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Move it.
not_available Okay, time to move, Jack.
not_available Head across the floor.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Okay, Jack, head towards the south wall.
not_available Hello, Jack.
not_available Hello, Jess.
not_available Do you remember Tracy Zigler? Yes.
not_available I just saw her last winter.
not_available Well, we keep in touch and she said you and Teri got divorced.
not_available Get out of there.
not_available No, we just got separated.
not_available Jared, take care of this.
not_available If you want to get in touch, reach me at this number here.
not_available Are you all right? I'm fine.
not_available Sorry.
not_available No, it's fine.
not_available You sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He's heading across now.
not_available Make a left in front of the turbines.
not_available Show him your ID.
not_available Jack Bauer, CTU.
not_available That's my boy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Go to the end.
not_available On the left is Medical Station 3.
not_available I'm here.
not_available It's where I want you.
not_available Go in and wait.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What happened to you? I'm okay.
not_available You don't look okay.
not_available Is it safe to come in here? Yeah, I looped the cameras.
not_available They can't see us.
not_available Why is Jack doing all this? They've kidnapped his wife and daughter.
not_available How long have you known this? Not long.
not_available You chose not to tell me.
not_available That's right.
not_available I was acting on orders.
not_available Screw orders! Tony, I'm sorry.
not_available Where's Jamey? She's still working with Milo.
not_available So what do you want to do? Restrain her and call in Division? No, we can't call anyone yet.
not_available We've gotta do something.
not_available I know.
not_available This whole thing must be about Palmer.
not_available They're using Jack to stop the investigation? Maybe.
not_available Hang on.
not_available We've got to do something.
not_available You sure this room is dark? I checked the log.
not_available There are no active cameras.
not_available We've got to call Secret Service.
not_available No.
not_available The people holding Teri and Kim will think Jack gave the order.
not_available I hate to say it, but it's not our problem.
not_available We have to protect Palmer.
not_available We got to make the call now.
not_available Wait.
not_available Jack wouldn't put Palmer's life in danger.
not_available Let's try to find out more before we do anything.
not_available Are you ordering me not to call Secret Service? No, you're right.
not_available Hi, it's Tony.
not_available Can you get me Agent Pierce's number? Assemble it.
not_available You want my prints on this weapon? Do you really think that anybody's going to believe that I shot David Palmer? You better put that away.
not_available Somebody might get hurt.
not_available We're watching the Senator work the room before he gives the speech.
not_available Milo, come here.
not_available You were right.
not_available About what? The keycard was a forgery.
not_available We found the original.
not_available Where? 
not_available Jack's office.
not_available Why did he swap it out? It doesn't matter.
not_available I sent it to Archiving to make a backup of all the data.
not_available Then, it's going straight to you.
not_available You'll have to work quickly.
not_available Just get it to me.
not_available A forged keycard? What's that about? I have no idea.
not_available She's squirming.
not_available Almeida.
not_available This is Pierce from Secret Service.
not_available I called because we have some new information you should know about.
not_available One of our agents, Jack Bauer, might be there today.
not_available Yes, he's here.
not_available I cleared him.
not_available We learned that he may have been compromised.
not_available He may not be acting to protect the senator.
not_available Are you saying he's a threat? Yeah.
not_available Take the appropriate actions.
not_available She's on the move.
not_available Okay, ladies restroom.
not_available Second to last stall.
not_available The cameras are on a 20
not_available second loop.
not_available Am I clear? No, not yet.
not_available Go.
not_available Got 20 seconds.
not_available Get out! Now! Grab it! All of it.
not_available Go! Can you tell if expectations are high in the party for the speech? I got to keep you guys working.
not_available The fatter your paycheck, the more taxes you can afford.
not_available That's right, Senator.
not_available Excuse me, guys.
not_available What's up? I just got a call from CTU.
not_available We need to get you out, sir.
not_available Why? There's a problem with one of their agents.
not_available What kind of problem? He could be a threat to you.
not_available If he's one of ours, why don't you find him and take care of this quietly? We are trying, sir.
not_available I'll tell you what.
not_available I'll lose the face time, but the speech stays.
not_available There's something I have to say this morning.
not_available With all due respect, I think it's a mistake, sir.
not_available This information comes directly from CTU headquarters.
not_available I am sure your people will take care of this.
not_available All Right! Everyone on the floor, listen up.
not_available This is Pierce.
not_available Palmer has decided to proceed.
not_available I repeat, Palmer will remain.
not_available We need to locate and detain a suspect whose name is Jack Bauer.
not_available Bauer is 5'11".
not_available Blond hair, 160 pounds.
not_available He is wearing a dark brown jacket that may display CTU ID.
not_available This is Hayes.
not_available Spotting is possible on Bauer.
not_available How would you like me to proceed? All right.
not_available Hold your position.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Copy.
not_available Hi, Jamey.
not_available What's this all about? Why don't you tell us? I have no idea what you're talking about.
not_available Who were you contacting in the bathroom? None of your business.
not_available It was personal.
not_available Are they the same people who set me up to be killed? Set you up to be killed? What are you talking about? We don't have time for this.
not_available Talk to us, Jamey.
not_available Who's got Jack's wife and daughter? What are they making Jack do? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Richard Walsh is dead.
not_available So is Scott Baylor.
not_available You'll be charged with murder and treason.
not_available I suggest you start telling me what's going on.
not_available They said no one would get hurt.
not_available Who are they? I can't tell you.
not_available Tell us everything you know! It's your only way out! Do you understand! I was just supposed to tap into the surveillance of all the security cameras.
not_available Then they asked me to send messages from inside.
not_available What messages? What messages! Mostly about Jack.
not_available Then about the keycard.
not_available I didn't know this was going to happen.
not_available You have to believe that.
not_available Fine, we do.
not_available But now you need to help us.
not_available Who were you doing all this for? No.
not_available I have to talk to someone first.
not_available What? No! There is no time, Jamey.
not_available Palmer is exposed.
not_available Jack's family is in danger.
not_available You have to start talking to us now! All right, Jamey.
not_available I'll make sure they cut you a deal, okay? No.
not_available I'm not saying anything, not until I get Agency counsel Sit! As Mayor of LA, I'm often given the opportunity to meet some truly remarkable people.
not_available People that strive for the greater unity.
not_available People that work to make our world a better place.
not_available One of those people is here today.
not_available And "remarkable" only begins to describe this man.
not_available Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States and my good friend, David Palmer.
not_available I love you, Kimberly.
not_available You know that? Yeah.
not_available Good.
not_available It's important that you know that.
not_available Mom, if you're feeling guilty about our fight yesterday I'm over it.
not_available I just want to get home.
not_available It's not why I'm saying that.
not_available We're stuck in this awful place and I just want you to know that you're not alone.
not_available Mom, you're scaring me.
not_available Sounds like you're saying this 'cause something bad will happen.
not_available TERI: No, no.
not_available It's just.
not_available I'm trying to explain to you what a simple, powerful thing my love for you is.
not_available So, no matter how bad things get or how good they get, that's not going to change.
not_available I just don't know how to do anything but love you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you very much.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Thank you, Mayor Nelson.
not_available And thank you, kind citizens of Los Angeles.
not_available Identification, please.
not_available You know, this country depends on a healthy economy in California.
not_available And the nucleus of that economy is energy.
not_available All right, Jack.
not_available Step out.
not_available We're ready for you.
not_available To do what? Relax.
not_available It will be over in five minutes.
not_available is standing right here in this room today.
not_available It's you! Do you see the photographer? The men and women who serve this industry.
not_available Yes.
not_available Go over and join him.
not_available After he shoots Palmer, he will hand you his weapon.
not_available You've got to be kidding me.
not_available I know you'll be tempted to intervene but you must believe me, Jack if you do, your family dies and we'll get Palmer anyway.
not_available I understand.
not_available When I started my campaign, over a year ago I made a promise to you who've supported me.
not_available That my campaign would be built on integrity, commitment and above all, honor.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Palmer! Thank you.
not_available Integrity, commitment, honor.
not_available Anything less would be unacceptable.
not_available Agent Bauer.
not_available Alan Hayes, Secret Service.
not_available I need you to come with me.
not_available What's the matter? 
not_available No problem.
not_available Just come with me.
not_available Seven years ago.
not_available Gun! Blanket Palmer.
not_available Get him out of here.
not_available Get Sherry.
not_available I can't see exactly.
not_available Palmer's being shielded.
not_available But why? Bauer? Bauer? What's happening? Did you screw me? I didn't do this.
not_available Do you understand? Please, don't hurt my family.
not_available Don't hurt my family.
not_available I'll help.
not_available I promise.
not_available Please! That's it, we're done.
not_available Kill the wife and kid! Get out of here! I don't have time for this.
not_available Hello? 
not_available What do you want? Division picked up Bauer at the power plant.
not_available They've been looking for him all night.
not_available Why? He's been breaking protocol since you got to him.
not_available Damn it! Take me! No! No! Mom! No! No! Don't! Please don't.
not_available Eli.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I still need them alive.
not_available Both of them? Yes.
not_available Take them back.
not_available KIM: No! No!

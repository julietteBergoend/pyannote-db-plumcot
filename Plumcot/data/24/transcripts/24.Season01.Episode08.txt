not_available They've kidnapped his wife and daughter .
not_available How long have you known this ?
not_available Not long .
not_available You chose not to tell me .
not_available That's right .
not_available I was acting on orders .

not_available Where's Jamey ?
not_available She's still working with Milo .
not_available So what do you want to do ?
not_available Restrain her and call in Division ?
not_available No , we can't call anyone yet .

not_available This whole thing must be about Palmer .
not_available They're using Jack to stop the investigation ?
not_available Maybe .
not_available Hang on .
not_available We've got to do something .
not_available You sure this room is dark ?
not_available I checked the log .
not_available There are no active cameras .
not_available We've got to call Secret Service .
not_available No .
not_available The people holding Teri and Kim will think Jack gave the order .
not_available I hate to say it , but it's not our problem .
not_available We have to protect Palmer .
not_available We got to make the call now .
not_available Wait .
not_available Jack wouldn't put Palmer's life in danger .
not_available Let's try to find out more before we do anything .
not_available Are you ordering me not to call Secret Service ?
not_available No , you're right .
not_available Hi , it's Tony .
not_available Can you get me Agent Pierce's number ?
not_available Assemble it .
not_available You want my prints on this weapon ?
not_available Do you really think that anybody's going to believe that I shot David Palmer ?
not_available You better put that away .
not_available Somebody might get hurt .
not_available We're watching the Senator work the room before he gives the speech .
not_available Milo , come here .
not_available You were right .
not_available About what ?
not_available The keycard was a forgery .
not_available We found the original .
not_available Where ?
not_available Jack's office .
not_available Why did he swap it out ?
not_available It doesn't matter .
not_available I sent it to Archiving to make a backup of all the data .
not_available Then , it's going straight to you .
not_available You'll have to work quickly .
not_available Just get it to me .
not_available A forged keycard ?
not_available What's that about ?
not_available I have no idea .
not_available She's squirming .
not_available Almeida .
not_available This is Pierce from Secret Service .
not_available I called because we have some new information you should know about .
not_available One of our agents , Jack Bauer , might be there today .
not_available Yes , he's here .
not_available I cleared him .
not_available We learned that he may have been compromised .
not_available He may not be acting to protect the senator .

not_available Yeah .
not_available Take the appropriate actions .
not_available She's on the move .

not_available We need to get you out , sir .
not_available Why ?
not_available There's a problem with one of their agents .
not_available What kind of problem ?
not_available He could be a threat to you .
not_available If he's one of ours , why don't you find him and take care of this quietly ?
not_available We are trying , sir .
not_available I'll tell you what .
not_available I'll lose the face time , but the speech stays .
not_available There's something I have to say this morning .
not_available With all due respect , I think it's a mistake , sir .
not_available This information comes directly from CTU headquarters .
not_available I am sure your people will take care of this .
not_available All Right !
not_available Everyone on the floor , listen up .
not_available This is Pierce .
not_available Palmer has decided to proceed .
not_available I repeat , Palmer will remain .
not_available We need to locate and detain a suspect whose name is Jack Bauer .
not_available Bauer is 5'11 " .
not_available Blond hair , 160 pounds .
not_available He is wearing a dark brown jacket that may display CTU ID .
not_available This is Hayes .
not_available Spotting is possible on Bauer .

not_available Hold your position .
not_available I'll be right there .
not_available Copy .


not_available The President's down! We need medical assistance.
not_available Help! Three years later.
not_available The following takes place between 1:00 pm and 2:00 pm.
not_available Events occur in real time.
not_available This is security, I need help here at the ramp.
not_available Officers, main blocks are in lockdown.
not_available Stand by Go, sir.
not_available Right hand on the screen.
not_available It's clear.
not_available Step over there please.
not_available I'll give back your IDs.
not_available Open 1.
not_available You're ok, Jack? I'll feel ok until we get this thing signed.
not_available That's not what I meant.
not_available Ok, we are here.
not_available What kind of change is we're talking about? 
not_available Don't worry, Jack.
not_available They're not deal breakers.
not_available He's still gonna give a part of terrorist cells he deals with.
not_available He just want to go to a classe 2 detention.
not_available Not maximum security.
not_available And you're gonna give it to him, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available My client's not happy that you won't hold him in Florida.
not_available He's getting Minnesota, that's the deal.
not_available Give him Florida, it doesn't make a difference.
not_available I let you two do your jobs, why won't let you do mine? Because we don't want this thing going south over small detail.
not_available Salazar is instable, we can't predict what's gonna push his buttons and to be frank: there's too much in stake.
not_available Listen Jack, I know you two spend last year getting Salazar and I respect that but there's a protocol that I have to follow 
not_available Luis, come here for a second.
not_available Putting him away, it's not the point here.
not_available If he doesn't talk, we haven't accomplished anything.
not_available I didn't lose a year of my life to arrest some drug dealer.
not_available Salazar does business with terrorist cells around the world.
not_available Bringing them down is our only objective, are we clear? 
not_available I understand.
not_available But if you give Salazar everything he asked for, he's just gonna want more.
not_available This is the deal and he's going to take it.
not_available You'd better be right.
not_available Is that my life you're holding in your hand? It's ready to be signed.
not_available Are you in there, Jack? Forget about Bauer.
not_available How can I forget about the man who put me here? Pretended to be my friend? Im concerned about you, Jack.
not_available The things you did to get me here I wouldn't wish on anyone.
not_available Let's face it, you'll never be the same.
not_available Hey! Neither will I.
not_available So, I guess we are in the same boat.
not_available I'm about to name names, Jack.
not_available This is a big moment for both of us.
not_available That makes me happy, because you see, we are connected now.
not_available I don't know, maybe we always have been? 
not_available I've marked the changes.
not_available I don't need to see the changes, but I do need a pen.
not_available Unless you want me to sign it with my own blood.
not_available It's kind of funny.
not_available My own blood.
not_available Where do I sign this? Right here.
not_available You've done a good job as my counsellor.
not_available In a go
not_available to guy, as they like to say here in States.
not_available I think that I own to you but I don't think you have what it takes to keep your mouth shut.
not_available What do you mean? Son of a bitch! Open the door! Open the door! Do it! Now! Get a medic in here! This is your fault, Jack.
not_available And what happens next is on you too.
not_available Is that a threat? Is that a threat? Son of a bitch! Back off! 
not_available Take a walk! Did you hear me? Did you hear me? What happens next is on you, Jack.
not_available It's on you! Dr Macer? We isolated the body like you asked.
not_available You said my name was on it? 
not_available Yes, it's on his chest.
not_available Spread a full panel of tests just to be sure but I think we're dealing with a new immuno
not_available virus type 3.
not_available Type 3? Isn't that the virus group your team's been doing simulations on? Yeah, I think that's why this was addressed to me.
not_available Has CTU been contacted again? No, we're been waiting for you.
not_available Go ahead and start the preliminary tests, I'll call Director Almeida.
not_available All right.
not_available Hey! the President arrived at SC yet? Just about.
not_available We're swapping at some of our people now and the secret service is in place.
not_available They're waiting for your resource assessment.
not_available Alright, I'll call him.
not_available I've had it Tony, I swear to God! 
not_available What's the problem, Adam? Chloe O'Brian does not touch my data.
not_available If field ops wants something, she asks Jack or talks to you, and you tell me.
not_available Did she damage anything? 
not_available That's not the point.
not_available The reason my department has zero down time is because of the procedures I put in place.
not_available Did she damage anything? No, she didn't but I will 
not_available Go.
not_available Look, Jack's got his department, I got mine.
not_available We are all in the same roof, understood? Good.
not_available Now lighten up.
not_available Don't drive yourself and the rest of us crazy.
not_available All right, hold on.
not_available Sony Macer from Health services is on the line.
not_available By the way, have you heard from Hertzog? No, not yet.
not_available Relax, Michelle, you're gonna get the job.
not_available It had better, you're not going in Langley without me.
not_available Hey! Sunny, what's up? 
not_available This is what I'm really sorry to be right about.
not_available What are you talking about? Cordella virus, it's a type 3 immuno
not_available virus.
not_available Remember last month at the conference, I raised the possibility a strain could be out there.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Well, it is.
not_available Someone just dropped out a dead body infected with a virus.
not_available Tony, these guys are serious.
not_available They blew a hole in the door to get our attention.
not_available This is obviously some kind of message.
not_available A message? What? That somebody's got the virus and is willing to release it? 
not_available Yeah, exactly.
not_available Do we need to issue a quarantine adviser? 
not_available No, once the host is dead, he's not contagious.
not_available Right, do me a favour, call the other county facilities and see if there's anymore cases.
not_available I will.
not_available What about the ID on the John Doe? Send everything you have over here.
not_available We'll work it up.
not_available It's on its way.
not_available Yeah, thanks Sunny.
not_available What is it? Initiate the level 1 setting protocol.
not_available And I don't think you have what it takes to keep your mouth shut.
not_available What do you mean? Salazar wanted to kill Shaye.
not_available He could have done any time in the last 
not_available He's cutting his deal.
not_available Maybe, but I don't think so.
not_available This is your fault, Jack.
not_available And what happens next is on you too.
not_available What happens next? CTU.
not_available This is Bauer, patch me through to Almeida.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available Tony, is there anything going on over there? We just had a major protocol come in, possible bio
not_available threat on the city.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available Well, a dead body infected with the Cordella virus was left at the Health Services.
not_available We figure it's just a first shoe dropping, we're waiting for somebody to take responsibility.
not_available Jack? Yeah.
not_available Do you think that this is connected to Salazar? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I don't know.
not_available Maybe.
not_available Look, I'll get back to you.
not_available I need copies of all four images.
not_available Right away.
not_available Hello, Mr President.
not_available Wayne, are we ready for the run
not_available through? Yeah, almost.
not_available The events team dropped the ball so we can't get in there for a few minutes.
not_available That's fine.
not_available No, no, it's not fine, David, I fired Judy, it was her fault.
not_available She's done some good work for, hasn't she? 
not_available Listen, tonight's debate is critical.
not_available and she should have had every single base covered but she didn't.
not_available Mr President, how do you feel about tonight's debate with senator Keeler? Confident, ready to go.
not_available Sir, this is your first come back to Los Angeles since the attempt on your life.
not_available Were you uneasy about coming back? 
not_available Not at all! Los Angeles is a great city.
not_available We'd be back here sooner if events had allowed it.
not_available What is important, is that we're here now, looking to the future.
not_available Thank you, that's all for now, a formal Q&amp;A; later this afternoon, you'll be briefed.
not_available David, we've gotta talk about those GAO numbers.
not_available I mean Keeler is gonna break it up tonight.
not_available You know who he is, and I'm just not really David, you're all right? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available Let me call one of the resident doctors.
not_available No, it's all right.
not_available I'll wait for Anne.
not_available Where you're going Jack? We have to talk about this.
not_available Not now! Then when? 
not_available Call me.
not_available Right now, we've gotta get back to CTU.
not_available Why? Salazar killed Shaye for a reason.
not_available He picked today to do it.
not_available We've gotta find out why.
not_available Fine, let's just go back in here and put the squeeze on Salazar? You think he's gonna talk to us after all we just watched him do? Not a chance.
not_available Come on, let's go! Jack! Just call me.
not_available Right, so, what else did Almeida say about this dead body? Jack! 
not_available What? I asked you about Tony.
not_available What else did he say? He said the body was dropped to Health Services, they're trying to ID it.
not_available You know, you never answered me before About how you're doing? What are you talking about? 
not_available You know what I'm talking about.
not_available This is Bauer.
not_available Jack, it's Chloe.
not_available I have Kate Warner for you, should I put her through? Yeah, put her me through.
not_available Jack? 
not_available Hi, Kate.
not_available I just wanted you to let you know I found out that leather jacket you thought you'd lost.
not_available Oh! Ok, great.
not_available So, what do you wanna do? I can bring it over or send it.
not_available No, you don't have to do that.
not_available Look, I'll just send someone over to pick it up.
not_available You're sure? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Ok, then.
not_available Kate, how are you? You know, it's hard.
not_available I miss you.
not_available I'm really, really sorry.
not_available Don't be.
not_available Take care of yourself, Kate.
not_available Bye.
not_available How's Kate? 
not_available She's all right.
not_available So you guys are still talking? 
not_available No, not really.
not_available All right.
not_available None of my business.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't mean it like that, she's just trying to return a couple thing of mine.
not_available That's all.
not_available I need water.
not_available I talked to Sony.
not_available She's gonna check with other facilities to see if there're anymore cases.
not_available If there are, find out where.
not_available Also let's take regional cells that they have bio
not_available terrorists capabilities and put them in the high speed cash.
not_available Ok.
not_available Tony, it's Larry Hertzog from Langley on line 2.
not_available Hey, Larry.
not_available Yeah, we are.
not_available Yeah, I will.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Is that about me? Yeah.
not_available He doesn't have a job for you right now.
not_available There's no new fund until the end of the election.
not_available I see.
not_available AlsoLarry told me that he needs an answer from me by the end of the day.
not_available Turner hurried the field post.
not_available You both know you can pass this up, it's major career move Call him and tell him it's yes.
not_available And you'll come along as the wife? Without a job I'd go anywhere with you.
not_available As so long as I don't have to cook.
not_available Sweetheart, if you promise not to cook, I will take you with me anywhere.
not_available But, if they don't have a job for you, I'm not interested.
not_available Tony, homeland security on line 1.
not_available We'll talk about it later.
not_available Pretty much, I just have to refresh the data on my panel.
not_available Hey! Kim? 
not_available Yes, Michelle.
not_available Have you ever done a capability search? A couple weeks ago, I had to do one for Tony.
not_available East european cells? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Good.
not_available This one it's different.
not_available It's gonna be global.
not_available Here is my access codes.
not_available I'll be right on it.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hey Adam! Does the link 4 have a DES encryptions? No, it's 2 key.
not_available Why is the filter on? 
not_available It's 2 to 7.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Está ***.
not_available Sí.
not_available Puede ser que no está listo.
not_available Sí.
not_available Está listo.
not_available Se le ve en los ojos.
not_available Me recuerda a ti, chiquitita.
not_available Are you saying you had to break me? No, mi ángel, it was you who break me.
not_available ¿Que más? Tienen el cuerpo.
not_available ¿Y saben con quién están tratando? 
not_available Creo que sí.
not_available Seguro.
not_available Pare 10 minutos por que entre al systema.
not_available Luego haces tu llamada.
not_available Sí señor.
not_available Ok, it's coming up now.
not_available Thanks, Chris.
not_available Adam, I'm piping this over to your system.
not_available What is it? Frags on the body that was dropped off at the Health Services.
not_available We're doing an ID analysis.
not_available Kim, where are you on the capability search? It's still running, it's gonna be another 15 minutes.
not_available So, you're open? Yeah, what do you need? Adam is gonna break up a part of an ID.
not_available We need a name.
not_available Give her the DNA file.
not_available Michelle, I don't need her help.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available This is urgent.
not_available I'm ready, Adam, send the file.
not_available I'm open, Adam, send me the file.
not_available No.
not_available Michelle just told you.
not_available I don't need anyone doing my work for me.
not_available What is your problem? 
not_available My problem is that everyone in this place earned their job.
not_available You got it because of your dad.
not_available What the hell is this? Tracy, is your system locked? 
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Ok, thanks.
not_available You know, it could be that you forgot to set the group permission someone who knows the structure and changed the ownership.
not_available That wouldn't be, because I'm incompetent and I only got this job because of my dad.
not_available Change the ownership back, Kim.
not_available Send the data fork.
not_available It's your ass Michelle is waiting.
not_available Fine, I send it.
not_available Just unlock my system.
not_available No problem.
not_available Hey Jack, I'll be up in a minute.
not_available Ok.
not_available Chloe, give me what you got.
not_available Are we in sync with other systems downstairs? Everything Health Services sent on the body is in volume one and I've reprieved all the Salazar information you wanted.
not_available Where are the date keys? 
not_available I couldn't get those for you.
not_available Why not? You'll have to talk to Tony, so that Tony can tell Adam, and Adam can give them to me.
not_available You're kidding me, right? 
not_available No, Adam's completely anal about that kind of stuff, and he hates women.
not_available Chloe, just get it for me, ok? Please.
not_available And close my door.
not_available Jack, it's Michelle.
not_available The teleconference with Health Services is about to start, you might come down.
not_available No, I'm gonna stay up here.
not_available Just pass them through, ok? 
not_available Ok.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You scared me! What are you doing in here? 
not_available Iam refreshing a drive.
not_available What's going on with Salazar? You were there when it happened? YeahYeah, it's been crazy.
not_available How's my dad taking it? He's ok.
not_available Good.
not_available Then, I was thinking about talking to him today.
not_available Ok, today might not be the best day.
not_available Chase, no day is a good day.
not_available We said it that we would tell him if we were still together after two months.
not_available It's almost three.
not_available Why don't we just tell him and get it over with? All right.
not_available But I'll do it.
not_available Ok? Are you sure? 
not_available Yes, I'm sure.
not_available Really? Really? Ok, look, you can't put the drive in there, what I need you to do is look under 6, right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available We just received results of more tests, Tony.
not_available Unfortunately, the news isn't good.
not_available This is a weaponized strain.
not_available The virus has been engineered to kill more rapidly.
not_available How rapidly? It's a bit of a guess, but based on the autopsy if infection starts at t = 0 hours, there's a non
not_available contagiously latency period of 14 hours.
not_available After 14, it presents.
not_available After 20, the host is incapacitated.
not_available By 24, the host is dead.
not_available What are the epidemiological consequences? 
not_available If the virus initiates in a single location, there will be a couple hundred cases by the end of the day 1.
not_available By the end of the day 2, there could be in the thousands.
not_available But, from there, it's easier to talk about it in percentage of population.
not_available By the end of the first week, 9% of Los Angeles county would be infected.
not_available That's over 1 million people.
not_available And those people will die within 24 hours of infection.
not_available Right, tell me, if someone is gonna try to release this virus in the general population, how would they do it? 
not_available That's a $1 million question.
not_available It could come from anywhere.
not_available We don't know who has it.
not_available There's no way to know where they've planned to release it.
not_available We don't even know what form it's in.
not_available Kyle? Yeah, 'ma.
not_available Tim wants you to know that he's down at the pool.
not_available Can you take me to the doctor later on this afternoon? What's dad doing? 
not_available On a job interview.
not_available Fingers crossed.
not_available Can aunt Norma take you? What? What's so important that you can't take me? I mean, it's just that I've got a bunch of stuff to do today, 'ma.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Fine, I'll call Norma.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Love you, 'ma.
not_available Mr.
not_available President, the country was in shock after the attempt on your life.
not_available But his prayers were answered when it was clear that you would survived.
not_available That said, many americans have expressed concerns that you are not fully recovered and may not be strong enough to serve for 4 more years.
not_available How do you respond to those who make such claims? I wake up every morning at 5 am.
not_available I spend the first hour in the wait room.
not_available While I'm exercising, I'm preparing for my morning meetings.
not_available And then, I could in a 16hours 
not_available Hold down! Could you pause the video please? Get ready to play it back.
not_available Sorry, Chuck.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Don't dignify that question with a defensive response.
not_available I didn't realize that stating the facts was being defensive.
not_available They bring up this assassination attempt, fine.
not_available Let them.
not_available You remind everyone that it was your administration that had only arrested the man behind the attempt on your life but you also exposed his organisation and put a stop to your people way as well.
not_available All this while you're in this so called "weakened state".
not_available And Keeler would be lucky to have a fraction of your energy! That's what you tell them.
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available Go ahead, Chuck.
not_available And mum called him "the timid brother".
not_available Ah! There is my doctor.
not_available How are you? 
not_available Mr.
not_available President.
not_available All right everyone.
not_available Let's break for a few minutes please.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available How's he been? He seems a little tired 
not_available I am not tired.
not_available Just a little joggled.
not_available How's this going? I'm definately winning the runthrough! 
not_available 130/80.
not_available Good.
not_available This is Wayne Palmer.
not_available How tired? 
not_available I'm fine.
not_available We haven't done a work upon you in a while and I'd really like NoNoNoNo tests.
not_available You start looking for something, and you don't stop until you find it.
not_available I'm fine, Anne.
not_available Ok, but when you get back to D.
not_available C., I want you to have a complete physical.
not_available Doctor's orders.
not_available Yes, ma'am.
not_available Anne, I need him alone for a minute.
not_available So, he's all yours.
not_available What is it? 
not_available I just received a very disturbing phone call from Health Services.
not_available It seems they found a body here in Los Angeles that's been infected with an extremely contagious and deadly virus.
not_available Now there's concerns this is not just a random occurrence.
not_available Meaning what? Meaning CTU is looking for the possibility that this could be a criminal action.
not_available Criminal action? Based on this one death? I don't know the details David but it has to do with the circumstances in which the body was found.
not_available Keep your eye on this one.
not_available Ok.
not_available Chuck, can we go on the question number 7 please about homeland security? 
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Chloe? Yes? 
not_available Where is the transcript of Salazar and the D.
not_available A.? I sent them to your system, it's in your directory.
not_available Damn it, I didn't want it in my directory, I wanted it stored with the rest of the files from Salazar! Ok, I'll do it.
not_available Chloe, listen to me.
not_available If you can't start getting things right the first time, just let me know because I can get someone else who can.
not_available I did do it right.
not_available If you wanted it with the other files, you should have said so that it isn't standard so I wouldn't think of doing it in that way, would I? Just do it that way from now on! Ok? I can read minds, Jack, you've just gonna have to spell it out for me, otherwise this relationship won't Damn it, Chloe! Just do it now! Fine.
not_available Hey Jack.
not_available What? What was that about? 
not_available I need you to replace Chloe for me.
not_available Replace her? But she's the best analyst we got.
not_available No, she's not.
not_available She's slow.
not_available She's not slow.
not_available I mean, she may be a little weird but she knows her stuff.
not_available You look like hell.
not_available What did you say to me? Well, we're in actif protocol, ok? And I need to know if you're up for it or not.
not_available I like you Chase, you're a nice kid.
not_available But don't you ever come in my office and talk to me like that again.
not_available Do you understand me? I'm just saying you're on edge.
not_available Ok? I mean, come on man, you're about to fire Chloe for no reason.
not_available I'm sorry I took your head off.
not_available I was just in a bad mood.
not_available Ok? You're happy? Look Jack, there's one more thing I've gotta talk to you about.
not_available Ok, we'll be right down.
not_available They got something on Salazar.
not_available What do you wanna tell me? Nothing.
not_available It will hold.
not_available Good.
not_available So, in order tu plug any possible security breaches, we're doing day checks from now on.
not_available Break your logs into 8 hours or less Did you tell him? 
not_available No, there's a lot going on right now.
not_available It will happen, I promise.
not_available An anonymous phone call just came in FBI by 10 minutes ago.
not_available We're getting into this right now.
not_available Did you hear it? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Ok, it's ready.
not_available Bring it up.
not_available I know you received our package and realize we're in possession of a type 3 pulmonary immuno
not_available virus.
not_available Listen very carefully to these instructions.
not_available Our demand is very simple.
not_available We want the release of Ramón Salazar in the next 6 hours.
not_available If you refuse to comply, the virus will be unleashed to the general population.
not_available As your experts will tell you, you would not have time to stop its spread.
not_available Details how Ramón is to be delivering will follow.
not_available That's it.
not_available Do we know where the phone call originated from? We don't know yet.
not_available It came from a scrambled satellites, you know.
not_available We're trying to narrow it down.
not_available Jack, you know Salazar better than anybody else here.
not_available Who do you think we're dealing with? Without a doubt his brother.
not_available Hector was next in command.
not_available He went underground the second Ramón was taken into custody.
not_available Now look, I know for a fact that the Salazars own multiple properties in South America and Mexico registered under dummy corporations.
not_available Unfortunately, right now, the Mexican government, it seems they can't locate them.
not_available So we've gonna to throw out a pretty large net to try and trace the origin of that call.
not_available Right, we'll work on it.
not_available Ok.
not_available How are we doing with the ID on the dead body? 
not_available Michelle is working on the DNA.
not_available Ok.
not_available What about prints and dental? 
not_available No teeth, no finger tips.
not_available Ok.
not_available Look, we need this ID.
not_available This's the only hook we've got into their operation.
not_available What about questionning Salazar? 
not_available Complete waste of time.
not_available This is a man without vulnerability.
not_available He doesn't respond to physical interrogation, and he doesn't care about another living soul including his own children.
not_available Tony, we've a match on John Doe.
not_available Michelle, what did you get? The dead body is a David Goss.
not_available He's a street dealer in east L.
not_available A., also an informant.
not_available It looks like he flips sides some many times DEA stopped working for over more a year ago.
not_available Do we have a last known address? 
not_available We're working on it.
not_available Ok.
not_available We're gonna need to know who infected Goss.
not_available You've gonna to work up a list of everyone who's being involved in this life over the last weeks.
not_available All right.
not_available We'll pull together everything we got hands on.
not_available Ok, but work it from the other side as well, go through Salazar network.
not_available See if you can find this supplier who sold to Goss.
not_available Good work.
not_available Chase, come with me.
not_available We'll see if anything is coming on Hector.
not_available Que es eso? Los que no se usamos.
not_available ¿Y no va afectar mi tierra? 
not_available No! No, no.
not_available La tierra va a quedar bien, señor.
not_available ¿Entonces, asegura que no se note nada? 
not_available Sí, señor.

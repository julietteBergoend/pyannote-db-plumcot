not_available Walsh isn't answering .
not_available As soon as you reach him , you find me .
not_available Is this the crew list from the 747 ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Should I get a maintenance history on the plane ?
not_available No .
not_available For now , let's just assume this was not an accident .
not_available Why ?
not_available It originated out of Berlin .
not_available It's where Walsh said the shooter was coming from .
not_available Break down the crew and passenger list.
not_available political affiliation , criminal record.
not_available country of origin and residence .
not_available Jack .
not_available What ?
not_available You want to tell me what's going on here tonight ?
not_available What's going on ?
not_available Besides a 747 falling out of the sky and a threat on a presidential candidate's life ?
not_available That's right .
not_available Besides that .
not_available Look , George Mason comes in here disappears up in your office for a half an hour , then he limps out .
not_available What's that all about ?
not_available Tell him , Jack .
not_available Fine , then I will .
not_available Nina .
not_available The three agents that Jack brought down on bribery charges were close friends of Mason .
not_available He's been looking for payback ever since .
not_available He chose tonight to make some pretty nasty accusations about Jack as well as some other people in this office .
not_available In case you haven't noticed , Jack doesn't have a lot of tolerance for criticism .
not_available I need that right away .
not_available I'll get you that list within the hour .
not_available Thank you .
not_available That was quite a story .
not_available It's better than the truth .
not_available Did you get the ID ?
not_available Yes .
not_available It's funny .
not_available When you came to Jack's rescue back there with your little performance.
not_available it reminded me of something .
not_available Yeah , what ?
not_available Remember that time we came into work together about a month ago ?
not_available Lisa made some wisecrack remark and you came up with this really great
not_available story an early breakfast meeting with District Three .
not_available I was really impressed with how convincing a liar you are .
not_available What's your point , Tony ?
not_available I want to know what happened up there between Jack and Mason .
not_available I already told you .
not_available And I don't believe you .
not_available Maybe I should ask Mason .
not_available A presidential candidate's life is at stake .
not_available Maybe you should get back to work .
not_available I think we need to turn right here .
not_available There it is .
not_available Janet ?
not_available Janet ?
not_available Hello ?
not_available Hey , sweetheart .
not_available Have you found the girls yet ?
not_available No .
not_available We just got here .
not_available Janet's car is parked out front .
not_available I just got here .
not_available All right .
not_available I'll wait 'til you check it out .
not_available No , let me call you back .
not_available I'll hold .
not_available Kim ?
not_available Teri ?
not_available Kim ?
not_available They were here .
not_available What did you give her ?
not_available Nothing she didn't want .
not_available Look , my dad is a government agent .
not_available I thought you said your dad was dead .
not_available He's not .
not_available If I'm not home in the next half hour he's going to be all over this .
not_available Told you , you should have given her a roofie .
not_available I'm serious .
not_available You two are toast .
not_available She's giving me a headache , dude .
not_available Just chill , okay ?
not_available You chill .
not_available Walsh .
not_available Did anyone see you come in ?
not_available No .
not_available You weren't followed ?
not_available Take it easy .
not_available No , I'm not going to take it easy .
not_available I'm not .
not_available I should never have called you .
not_available If you have evidence that someone inside the agency is involved in a plot against David Palmer then you had no choice .
not_available Here .
not_available It's all yours .
not_available I'm out of this .
not_available Wait .
not_available A keycard ?
not_available Yeah , it's just a simple keycard .
not_available The kind we use to get in and out of the building .
not_available I don't get it .
not_available Normally , the magnetic stripe has just an access code on it .
not_available But the stripe can hold a ton of data .
not_available On this one , I found a file filled with references to Palmer .
not_available What's the point ?
not_available To smuggle confidential information .
not_available These get in and out of restricted areas without any scrutiny .
not_available I need you to be reachable throughout the day .
not_available You said after tonight I'm done .
not_available I can't help it , Scott .
not_available Until we defuse this situation , I need to be able to find you .
not_available I find out there's an agency conspiracy to kill David Palmer .
not_available The moment I realized what I stumbled onto , I put my wife and kid on a plane .
not_available I couldn't even tell them why .
not_available I've been here long enough to know what I'm dealing with .
not_available It's your thing now .
not_available I'm out .
not_available Scott .
not_available What you did took a lot of courage .
not_available I'm asking you to hang in there with me a little longer .
not_available I did my part .
not_available Get someone else .
not_available There is no one else .
not_available You got me for another 24 hours .
not_available Then I'm joining my family .
not_available Yes , I know Palmer gets a lot of death threats , but this one's got some weight .
not_available We're overloaded .
not_available We'll deal with it
not_available No , you're gonna have to make some adjustments in your schedule .
not_available You're gonna have to notify his advance team , tighten up security on your end .
not_available I understand Yes .
not_available I've gotta go .
not_available I'll update you in an hour .
not_available You'll updateOne hour ?
not_available Yes .
not_available Fine .
not_available Teri ?
not_available Jack .
not_available I need you .
not_available Richard ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available I'm at 2350 Dunlop Plaza .
not_available I got two shooters trying to hit me and an agent down .
not_available Richard , what's going on ?
not_available I've got hard information on who is behind the Palmer hit .
not_available Isley can get there before me .
not_available He's in the area .
not_available No , don't call anyone .
not_available We still don't know who we can trust .
not_available Just get me out of here .
not_available I'll be there in 10 minutes .
not_available I'll be on the roof .
not_available Richard ?
not_available Richard ?
not_available Hello ?
not_available Hey , It's Me .
not_available What's going on ?
not_available Is Kim at the store ?
not_available No , she's not here .
not_available I thought you said you saw their car .
not_available We think she left with the boys .
not_available This guy you're with ,
not_available York does he know either of these boys ?
not_available No , but one of them , Dan , works here .
not_available I'm starting to worry a little bit .
not_available Can't you get over here ?
not_available I can't .
not_available I don't have time to explain , but some bad things are happening tonight .
not_available Our daughter's missing
not_available I think that's bad , don't you ?
not_available Teri , she's not missing .
not_available She's partying .
not_available Kim's smart enough to know her limits .
not_available Yeah ?
not_available Maybe you should come over here and see what those limits are , Jack .
not_available What's that supposed to mean ?
not_available Nothing .
not_available We're going to wait here for them to come back for the car .
not_available Call me when you're done with your emergency , okay ?
not_available I will .
not_available I'm sorry ,
not_available okay ?
not_available I'll call you as soon as I can .
not_available Bye .
not_available Look , I know it seems like we're these really bad guys
not_available but we're cool , I swear .
not_available There's just some stuff we got to do .
not_available Go along with it , and you guys won't get hurt .
not_available I don't even know what you want me to go along with .
not_available Is this some sort of fraternity stunt or something ?
not_available Something like that .
not_available Fine .
not_available Whatever .
not_available I'll tell your friends whatever you want me to just let us go .
not_available It's not that simple .
not_available These people
not_available What people ?
not_available Dan , pull over .
not_available She's choking .
not_available It's okay .
not_available She's not breathing ,
not_available you idiot !
not_available I don't care .
not_available Stop .
not_available Get back !
not_available Don't be a moron !
not_available Don't be a bitch .
not_available Brush fires set off by the wreckage are making the prospect of locating possible survivors of Flight 221 virtually impossible .

not_available Let me know as soon as he does .
not_available Okay .
not_available It's twenty after one .

not_available You seen this ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available It's horrible .
not_available I'm sorry I walked away before .
not_available What did Maureen Kingsley say to you on the phone ?
not_available It's nothing serious .
not_available I'm overreacting to everything right now .
not_available Today is going to be the second most important day of my life .
not_available And what would the first one be ?
not_available I think you know .
not_available I still like to hear you say it .
not_available All right .

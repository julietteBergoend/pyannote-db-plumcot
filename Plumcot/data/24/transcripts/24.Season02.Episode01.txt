
not_available When? Today.

not_available I wish Nicole could have come.
not_available She loves it out here.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What do you wanna do tonight? I don't know.
not_available Get a movie? You came all this way to watch a video? How's your mom? Who knows? She puts on a happy face for everyone, but I know she's hurtin'.
not_available Yeah.
not_available OK.
not_available Copy that.
not_available What is it, Rosser? 
not_available There's a situation, Mr President.
not_available OK, try and find me! Excuse me.
not_available What are you doing in my bed? Sh.
not_available I'm hiding from Daddy.
not_available What? 
not_available Oh, hi.
not_available Hey, Kim.
not_available You haven't seen Megan around, have you? What does she look like? 
not_available Big wart on the tip of her nose.
not_available I do not! 
not_available There you are.
not_available Now I'm gonna getyou.
not_available Let me go! 
not_available I'm gonna getyou now.
not_available I'm going to hide again.
not_available How do you keep up with her all day? It's not easy.
not_available Dad, I'm hiding! Try to find me! Here I come! Rayburn is waiting for us.
not_available I'll see you back at the retreat.
not_available Look, son 
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Don't be.
not_available It's notyour fault.
not_available I just miss hanging out with you.
not_available I know.
not_available We'll get there.
not_available See you later.
not_available All right.
not_available I know you wanna spend time with him.
not_available I'm sorry, sir.
not_available How bad is the situation? 
not_available I don't know, but I don't have a good feeling.
not_available To my knowledge, no president's been rerouted by NSA on a morning off.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I didn't know how you liked intel presented at impromtus, if you like it chronologically with an alphabetical key, or if you just like separate folders with access tabs.
not_available I don't really care.
not_available I did it both ways, so you can choose.
not_available Thanks, Paula.
not_available George.
not_available Hi, Mr Mason.
not_available Yeah? I ordered upgrades on all the SIM software.
not_available I hope you don't mind.
not_available They just went to production and I thoughtyou'd Paula, stop.
not_available Right.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What do you need? 
not_available Division want a meeting next month.
not_available For what? They wanna see our proposal for the LAX security upgrades.
not_available Tony, if I'm still here this time nextyear, take me out to the woodshed and shoot me.
not_available I should be in DC, not chasing old ladies who set off metal detectors with knitting needles.
not_available The morning of the 15th? That's fine.
not_available Mr Mason.
not_available What? I just got off the phone with Eric Rayburn's office at NSA.
not_available They've a request, sir.
not_available They wantyou to take care of it right away.
not_available This can't be right.
not_available Eileen, get me Rayburn.
not_available I think he's up in Oregon with the president.
not_available Put it in my office.
not_available What was that about? NSA wants us to bring in Jack Bauer.
not_available What? What for? I don't know.
not_available That's all they said.
not_available Isn't Bauer inactive? Yeah, he's inactive.
not_available We'll have to reschedule our day.
not_available What do we have? National Wildlife benefit at one, a tour of the new Nike Campus, and your speech tonight.
not_available OK.
not_available Cancel whatyou have to, but I wanna give that speech, announce the new clean
not_available energy proposal.
not_available I'm not sure you'll have time for any of that.
not_available Eric.
not_available I'll take care of it.
not_available Thanks, Jenny.
not_available What's this about, Eric? 
not_available We have a domestic terrorist alert.
not_available How serious? 
not_available Very.
not_available Has Lynne been informed? 
not_available She's here.
not_available Who else? Representatives from all branches of the military, some FBI and the CIA.
not_available Mr President, I've called Mike Novick.
not_available He's getting on a plane right away.
not_available Good.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Gentlemen.
not_available Lynne.
not_available Morning, Mr President.
not_available What I'm about to tell you, Mr President, is triple
not_available sourced.
not_available While crucial details are still unknown, we believe this intel to have high credibility.
not_available Go on.
not_available There's a nuclear device, under terrorist control, that's on US soil.
not_available My God! Where? 
not_available Los Angeles.
not_available It gets worse.
not_available This bomb is going to go off today.
not_available How do we knowthis? This suicide bomber is Mamud Rashed Faheen, a suspected terrorist who we believe has been associated with fundamentalist groups.
not_available This is the Valentine's Day bombing in the West Bank? This particular attack resulted in 13 fatalities, 26 injured.
not_available We discovered that the secondary purpose of this incident was to create the impression Faheen was killed.
not_available He wasn't? 
not_available No.
not_available This was taken five days ago at a small airport outside Léon, France.
not_available We had the man on the left, Jason Park, under surveillance.
not_available It was just a coincidence that we caught the very much alive Faheen in the photo.
not_available We grabbed Park and tried to extract everything we could out of him.
not_available and confessed that for the last two years Faheen has been preparing for today's attack on Los Angeles.
not_available Why didn'tyou pick up Faheen? This picture wasn't analysed until after the two had separated.
not_available I've contacted Defense, CIA, FBI and local jurisdictions.
not_available Everything will be run through NSA.
not_available Who controls Faheen? Relatively new splinter group that goes by the name of Second Wave.
not_available Government affiliation? Officially not recognised by any Middle Eastern state.
not_available Unofficially? 
not_available Get me their prime minister.
not_available Right away.
not_available Gary, your breakfast is ready.
not_available Don't let it get cold.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available I won't be backtill this afternoon.
not_available I'm expecting a package.
not_available Keep an eye out for it? Sure.
not_available Mom, I'm going skateboarding.
not_available And what does that mean? I know 
not_available I have to put on my helmet and my elbow and knee pads.
not_available And stay close to Kim.
not_available Love you.
not_available What about Kim? She's the best nanny ever.
not_available You off? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Coffee's ready, I cutyour grapefruit and I bought some scones.
not_available Blueberry? 
not_available Of course.
not_available You look good today.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I'll see you tonight, OK? 
not_available OK.
not_available You know, Kim, you've got a great body.
not_available You work out? Not really.
not_available I like to swim.
not_available Yes.
not_available I have the prime minister on the phone for you.
not_available Mr Prime Minister.
not_available Mr President.
not_available I was told you need to speak to me.
not_available What can you tell me about a terrorist organisation known as Second Wave? I've heard of them, but my government firmly rejects its tenets and its methods.
not_available In fact, we've recently arrested several of its members.
not_available How do you account for three Second Wave camps operating unimpeded in your country? There are no camps in my country.
not_available Mr Prime Minister, I knowtwo things.
not_available One: Second Wave is planning an attack against one of my cities today.
not_available Two: your government supports Second Wave.
not_available I would appreciate it if you would stop using my people and my country as a source for every threat levelled at the United States.
not_available What I'm saying is not meant to be a threat, simply a statement of fact.
not_available If a bomb goes off on US soil today, I will have no choice but to retaliate, with immediate and decisive force, againstyour government.
not_available This is an insult.
not_available We are not planning to attackthe United States.
not_available Insult or not, if you care about the lives of your citizens, you need to hear me loud and clear.
not_available Mr Prime Minister, if a bomb goes off today, it will hurt us, but it will destroy you.
not_available Then, Mr President, you will have created an enemy of over one third of the world's population.
not_available Proceed carefully.
not_available You as well, sir.
not_available You wanna try it again? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Don't fall.
not_available You can do it, though.
not_available All right.
not_available Slow 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mr Bauer? Who is this? 
not_available I have George Mason from CTU on the line.
not_available I don't work for CTU any more.
not_available He said that I'm in the middle of something right now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I'm so proud of you.
not_available You did so good.
not_available Is there any blood? 
not_available Let me see.
not_available No, no blood.
not_available You're perfect.
not_available OK.
not_available I wanna go again.
not_available All right.
not_available Let's go, tough guy.
not_available Hey! I'm not a guy.
not_available You know what? Why don'tyou go play in the back yard.
not_available I'll meetyou there.
not_available See you in a bit.
not_available Hey, sweetheart.
not_available Dad, what are you doing here? 
not_available I just wanted to say hi.
not_available You haven't been returning my calls.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I didn't come to ask you for lunch or hang out.
not_available I know you just started this job, but I just wanted to see you.
not_available I miss you.
not_available I know.
not_available I miss you too.
not_available Then why won'tyou 
not_available Every time I see you, I think of Mom.
not_available No, honey, please 
not_available Yes, I do.
not_available If you wanna know, I'm telling you, it's too hard for me right now.
not_available All I ever wanted was the three of us to be together.
not_available It wasn'tyour fault.
not_available It just happened.
not_available Of course it was my fault.
not_available Dad.
not_available I'm so sorry, honey.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I love you.
not_available I'm just still not ready yet.
not_available Then when? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available Hey, Kim.
not_available Come on.
not_available I gotta go.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Come in, Eric.
not_available Mr President, you wanted to see me.
not_available Yes.
not_available This report seems to be missing a casualty assessment.
not_available I'm having those figures compiled right now.
not_available They'll be ready in about 10 minutes.
not_available Thank you, Eric.
not_available Mr President, if I may I think you need to have a serious conversation with the Pentagon.
not_available They need to know howto proceed.
not_available It's too early to discuss a response.
not_available We don't even know who to retaliate against.
not_available You knowthe prime minister was lying.
not_available He was lying about the terrorist camps.
not_available But that doesn't mean his government is responsible for this threat.
not_available Mr President, I think 
not_available Eric, enough.
not_available Right now, my only concern is protecting Americans.
not_available Somewhere in Los Angeles, there is a terrorist with his finger on the trigger.
not_available We've got to get him.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Hi, sweetheart.
not_available Hey, you two! Cut it out.
not_available What? I can't kiss my own wife? She's notyour wife for at least another 10 hours.
not_available Andre is on the phone.
not_available Is there a problem with the flowers? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available God! 
not_available Sorry.
not_available So where are the tables? They're not even here yet.
not_available I don't know how they're gonna get everything set up in time.
not_available I thoughtyou were picking your cousin up.
not_available I sent a car.
not_available Cab? No, the company car.
not_available Hey, Bob.
not_available How you doin'? 
not_available There's the groom.
not_available Let me get that for you.
not_available I'm fine.
not_available I told Marie I'd help her fix the fountain.
not_available Best get to it.
not_available Luis.
not_available Dad, did you tell Reza he could use the company car to pick up his cousin? Kate, honey, please.
not_available Not today.
not_available If it were every now and then, fine, but there's the condo in Palm Springs, the days off Why is ityou can't trust Reza? I can't believe it's because he's from the Middle East Dad, please.
not_available You brought me up better than that.
not_available I don't know.
not_available It's something else.
not_available What? I don't know.
not_available Maybe I'm just having a hard time letting go of my little sister.
not_available I do miss your mother so much today.
not_available She'd be so proud of both of you.
not_available Rayburn.
not_available Eric, it's George again.
not_available What have you got? 
not_available Not a lot.
not_available Haven't reached Bauer.
not_available What's this about? 
not_available Your office will be briefed.
not_available Just find him and bring him in.
not_available We're doing everything we can.
not_available I don't think he wants to be found.
not_available In his condition, I don't think he'll be worth a damn anyway.
not_available I'm not asking for your opinion.
not_available I need this guy now.
not_available I refuse to believe that given your resources you can't bring in one former agent.
not_available I'll tell you how you can get hold of Bauer, butyou're not gonna like it.
not_available I'm listening.
not_available You're with the president right now, correct? Yeah, I am.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Leave your message after the beep.
not_available Hi, Jack.
not_available It's Tony Almeida at CTU.
not_available I've left messages for you everywhere.
not_available Could you please give us a call? It's very important.
not_available This is Jack Bauer.
not_available Leave your message after the beep.
not_available Hello, Mr Bauer.
not_available I'm calling on behalf of President Palmer.
not_available The president needs to speak to you on an urgent matter.
not_available Please call us back Hello? 
not_available Mr Bauer? Please holdfor the president.
not_available Sir, I have Jack Bauer.
not_available Jack? 
not_available Mr President.
not_available You've been avoiding CTU's calls this morning.
not_available I don't work for them any more, sir.
not_available So I hear.
not_available How's it all going, Jack? 
not_available It's been difficult, sir.
not_available I'm sure it has.
not_available I've thought a lot aboutyou this pastyear.
not_available Thank you, Mr President.
not_available I knowthis is a bad time, but I need your help.
not_available I've been inactive for over a year.
not_available I can't see how I'd be of any help to anyone.
not_available We are in a grave situation that requires the attention of all branches of our national security.
not_available My advisors are convinced that you can play an important part in this effort.
not_available I'm sorry, but I'm in no condition 
not_available Jack, listen to me.
not_available I know you suffered a loss, I know it's hard, but this is not a routine request.
not_available Go to CTU, listen to what's happening, and then make your decision.
not_available Jack You saved my life.
not_available I trustyou as much as I trust anyone, and now I need your help.
not_available When do they need me? Now.
not_available Carla, why'd you come back? I was supposed to wrap a gift for Gary to take to his assistant today.
not_available I can do it.
not_available No.
not_available I have to do it.
not_available Why? Because Gary likes these things done in a very specific way.
not_available It would take too long to explain it.
not_available OK.
not_available Kim I'm sorry.
not_available Will you take Megan upstairs to play? Sure.
not_available Have you looked atyour system? No.
not_available What's up? Langley issued an information flow advisory.
not_available Whatever's going on will be inter
not_available agency.
not_available All right.
not_available Call Lindauer and Grothy and tell them they don't have a day off after all.
not_available And start filtering anything that comes in.
not_available Hey.
not_available Something's going on, isn't it? 
not_available We're not sure.
not_available I could do those redundancies.
not_available It's OK.
not_available I've studied the protocols.
not_available Paula, you're trying too hard.
not_available Just do your job.
not_available Everything's gonna be fine.
not_available Sorry.
not_available I waited to get assigned here for two years.
not_available I just Heads up.
not_available I need all department heads over here right now.
not_available We've an active priority.
not_available I just got off a conference call with NSA and Division.
not_available It appears there's a nuclear bomb, under terrorist control, somewhere here in Los Angeles, set to go off at some point in the course of the day, so From this moment on, we do not communicate with anybody outside of our secured envelope.
not_available That means we don't call home, we don't talkto friends, we don't call relatives.
not_available Our job is to find this device and stop it.
not_available We do not want to create panic.
not_available I knowthis isn't very pleasant, but this is our job, this is what we do.
not_available So let's do it.
not_available George.
not_available I still haven't been able to reach Jack.
not_available NSA got hold of him.
not_available Is this why they wanted him? I mean, he's been out of play for over a year.
not_available I'm guessing it has something to do with one of his previous covers.
not_available In this scenario, immediate loss of life would be in the lowthousands, relatively small.
not_available But the dispersal of radioactive debris from a dirty bomb is unpredictable and could multiply that figure many times over.
not_available I understand that we don't know whether this is a dirty bomb or something bigger.
not_available Give me the worst
not_available case scenario.
not_available All right.
not_available Worst
not_available case scenario.
not_available Stolen Soviet nuclear warhead, a properly configured trigger detonated 500 feet above the city.
not_available Approximately 100 square miles would be irradiated within seconds.
not_available Apart from the loss of life, this kind of blow would have global repercussions that would last for years.
not_available Thank you, Eric.
not_available What would you like to do about the Joint Chiefs, sir? They're waiting to hear from you.
not_available I'm not ready to speakto them yet.
not_available Mr President, if I could suggest thatyou at least start the dialogue.
not_available At this point, this is not a military operation.
not_available It is a potential terrorist attack, and that's the way I'm going to approach it.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Thank you, everybody.
not_available Paula, I need you to open up another socket for me.
not_available And Mason wants to see you in the conference room.
not_available Paula? 
not_available I don't know if I can do this.
not_available Of course you can do it.
not_available No, I'm just a programmer and I don't think I work very well under this kind of pressure, so maybe they just wanna bring somebody else in.
not_available Look, Paula, there is no one else.
not_available You're the best at whatyou do.
not_available You know the system inside out.
not_available That's why you're here.
not_available Just take it one task at a time.
not_available Right now all I need you to do is open up a couple of sockets.
not_available And then get to the conference room, all right? OK? OK.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, Jack.
not_available Hi, Tony.
not_available How you doing? 
not_available Fine.
not_available How you been? I've been all right.
not_available Where's George? He's waiting for you in the conference room.
not_available You've been briefed? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Jack.
not_available Jack Bauer, Michelle Dessler 
not_available What am I doing here, George? There's a rogue nuclear weapon here in Los Angeles, Jack.
not_available Intel says it's going off today.
not_available How good's your intel? 
not_available Very.
not_available NSA have high
not_available probability leads on regional cells that might be involved.
not_available How close are you to IDing a prime suspect? Not close at all.
not_available That's whatyou're here for.
not_available Where are you going, Jack? Jack? George, let me talkto him.
not_available Jack.
not_available Just give me a second, Tony.
not_available Hello? 
not_available It's me.
not_available Listen.
not_available This is really important.
not_available Dad, I told you today, I'm not ready.
not_available Kim, this is not about us.
not_available What's it about? I'm at CTU.
not_available They gave me some information.
not_available You and I have to leave Los Angeles together now.
not_available No, Dad.
not_available If you're going backto work, fine, butyou're not dragging me into it.
not_available I'm not trying to get backto work.
not_available Kim, don't hang up on me.
not_available Hi, this is Kim.
not_available Leave a message.
not_available Honey, it's me.
not_available If you don't wanna leave with me, fine, butyou've got to get out of Los Angeles.
not_available It's not safe for you here.
not_available Don't talk to anybody.
not_available Just go to Aunt Carol's.
not_available I'm gonna call her now and tell her thatyou're coming.
not_available When you get there, phone me.
not_available Sweetheart, please, just do this for me.
not_available Please.
not_available Jack, wait a minute.
not_available I don't have time.
not_available You were called in because it's a background match.
not_available You're the only one that can run with this.
not_available I don't care.
not_available It's not like before.
not_available We can get to Kim, get her out of the city, keep her safe.
not_available I promise you.
not_available The best thing you can do now is help us find that bomb.
not_available I trusted everybody here at CTU to protect my wife and I lost her.
not_available Tony, I'm not gonna lose my daughter.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I know, Jack.
not_available I was there.
not_available Tony, look, I know you did everything you could.
not_available I do.
not_available I just can't lose my daughter.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Carol, it's Jack.
not_available I wanted Kim to get out of the city and come visityou.
not_available I'll explain as soon as I talkto you.
not_available Could you do me a huge favour? As soon as she gets there, call me and let me know she's safe.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Great, Almeida.
not_available Now what? 
not_available Back off, George.
not_available I did the best I could.
not_available I guess your best isn't very good, then.
not_available Maybe there's another way to find Wald.
not_available Why didn't I think of that? I bet NSA had us bring in a burnt
not_available out agent for the challenge.
not_available Anyone could have done the job.
not_available Settle down, George, all right? Let's sit down, regroup and figure out what we're gonna do.
not_available What we're gonna do? We're gonna call NSA.
not_available Now.
not_available Here's the deal.
not_available I want Knoll or Grothy to pick up my daughter and take her a safe distance outside of this city.
not_available Done.
not_available I wanna be kept up to date on their status by Tony.
not_available Sorry, George.
not_available I don't trustyou.
not_available You're gonna have to start.
not_available What we're up against today none of us can walk away from.
not_available Tony and I'll both take care of Kim.
not_available I'll do it now.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Tell me about the regional cells.
not_available The most promising one's headed by Joseph Wald.
not_available Joseph Wald? Wald's been linked to a terror group called Second Wave.
not_available That's why it had to be you.
not_available You put in time undercover with him.
not_available I put him in jail, George.
not_available He's out on appeal.
not_available And he's actually awaiting trial right now on new charges.
not_available If he's convicted, he goes away for life.
not_available What's Wald's connection? NSA established meetings between him and the group behind the threat.
not_available Why didn'tyou pick Wald up? 
not_available We haven't tracked him down yet.
not_available He's not at any of the addresses in his file.
not_available Are there are key witnesses against Wald in his upcoming trial? 
not_available There's one.
not_available Marshall Goren.
not_available Apparently without him there's no case.
not_available Good.
not_available Bring him in.
not_available Here? What for? You want me to reestablish my cover with Wald.
not_available It takes at least six weeks.
not_available You want me to do this in under two hours.
not_available Where's the FBI holding Goren? Downtown, right here in protective custody.
not_available Good.
not_available Bring him in.
not_available Now.
not_available Scott's coming to the wedding? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available He called.
not_available I thoughtyou knew he wouldn't come.
not_available I dated him six years ago, honey.
not_available He's more like a brother to me.
not_available Is the groom jealous? Jealous? It's not a question of jealousy.
not_available It's a question of what I'm comfortable with.
not_available My brothers married women that had never been with another man.
not_available That's what my family expects of us all.
not_available I see.
not_available So, instead, they have to settle for Marie, who's what 
not_available damaged goods? All right, don't let him baityou.
not_available He's just trying to push our buttons.
not_available I've got this guy wrapped around my little finger and he knows it.
not_available Kate.
not_available Teléfono.
not_available I'll show you the seating chart.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Hello? 
not_available This is Ralph Burton.
not_available Is this a bad time? No, Ralph.
not_available Can you hold on a second? Sorry, Ralph.
not_available What's up? Didn'tyou get my cheque? Yes.
not_available That's not why I'm calling.
not_available When you askedfor a background on Reza Naiyeer, you were worried about his financial integrity.
not_available The reportyou showed me said I had nothing to worry about.
not_available Has something changed? Not exactly.
not_available He's done nothing wrong atyour father's company, and his financial dealings in the past have been legitimate.
not_available Great.
not_available So what's the problem? I was proofing a file on another individual.
not_available Reza's name came up.
not_available Yeah, so? There's a man named Syed Ali.
not_available He's an internationalfinancier with ties to several terrorist organisations.
not_available What are you saying? Reza knows this guy Ali? Well, according to this file, they've had dealings.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available It's possible that Reza's business with Ali was legitimate, that Reza didn't even know aboutAli's terrorist connection.
not_available But if you wanna knowfor sure, I'm gonna need your help.
not_available What do you need me to do? Let's not waste time.
not_available I don't want my decisions based on speculation.
not_available Before I read any of the reports, I want the sources and their reliability double
not_available checked.
not_available Excuse me.

milo_pressman l may be close to finding your assassin .
not_available You got a name ?
not_available Almost .
milo_pressman This is a scrambled medical file listing a series of plastic surgeries .
milo_pressman The shooter's probably trying to hide his identity .
not_available Or assume someone else's .
not_available To get close to Palmer .
not_available Mm hm .
not_available Call me when you get a name .
not_available Right .
not_available Pull over .

not_available Our side ?
president_david_palmer Before Maureen Kingsley can put it out , spin it the wrong way .
keith_palmer lt won't matter how the story comes out .
keith_palmer Everyone will still think l went to kill Gibson .
not_available Who's gonna believe it was an accident ?
president_david_palmer l believe you , son , if you say so .
president_david_palmer Look , when your mother and l go to this breakfast in an hour , we want you and Nicole to come with us .
not_available Why ?
keith_palmer So you can save your campaign by sacrificing me to CNN ?
president_david_palmer So l can stand by you , as your father .
keith_palmer lt's a little late for that .
president_david_palmer You never gave me a chance to help you .
not_available How could l ?
not_available You weren't there !
keith_palmer You you can tell yourself whatever you want , but your career always came first .
keith_palmer For you to expect me to stand up in front of everyone now and act like we're this family
president_david_palmer We are a family , Keith .
not_available Keith !
kim_bauer You missed a spot , right here on your neck .
kim_bauer Rick , help me get out of here .
not_available How ?
not_available This place is like a prison .
kim_bauer People break out of prison all the time .
rick_allen Look , Gaines said he'd let me go after l'd buried Dan .
rick_allen Now , once l'm out of here , l'll call your dad and tell him where you are .
kim_bauer Great plan , except you're not gonna get out .
kim_bauer Gaines won't let you go .
rick_allen He's got no reason to stop me .
not_available He doesn't need me any more .
not_available Exactly .
not_available What do you want me to do here ?
ira_gaines Replace the key card we gave you with the one your people are trying to decrypt .
jack_bauer Because we're getting too close ?
ira_gaines Just do it , Jack .
ira_gaines Remember , Jack , l can hear everything .
nina_myers l've been trying to reach you .
not_available What is going on ?
not_available My cellphone battery died .
nina_myers What happened at the hospital ?
not_available Did you find Kim ?
not_available Everything's fine .
not_available She was just at a party .
not_available That's good .
nina_myers Did Teri give you my message ?
not_available No .
nina_myers We lD'd the corpse you brought in .
not_available His name is Alan York .
not_available What ?
nina_myers He's an accountant from the valley .
nina_myers We still don't know how he's connected to this .
nina_myers But we did have a breakthrough in the key card .
not_available Give me one minute .
jack_bauer lf Alan York is dead , who is the man with my wife ?
ira_gaines He's not an accountant from the valley
not_available , that's for sure .
jack_bauer lf you harm my daughter or my wife
jack_bauer , l will kill you , you son of a bitch .
not_available Oh , my God !
not_available What have you done ?
not_available What have you done? !
ira_gaines Everything's fine , Jack .
ira_gaines But that will be the last sound your wife and daughter hear unless you get hold of yourself
ira_gaines and you do as you're told .
not_available l'll do what you want .
not_available That's the spirit .
not_available Now , the key card .
ira_gaines l want you to replace it with the one you took from the car .
not_available That won't be easy .
ira_gaines Well , l'm sure you'll find a way .
jack_bauer Not without attracting attention .
ira_gaines That would be unacceptable .
ira_gaines You implicate yourself , you cease to be useful and so does your family .
ira_gaines As l said , Jack , find a way .
not_available Fine .
not_available OK .
not_available The cellular customeryou are trying to reach is currently out of range .
not_available Please leave a message at the tone .
not_available Kevin .

not_available Be careful .
not_available You OK ?
not_available l feel a little woozy .

not_available Yeah ,
not_available l know what l said .
rick_allen Well , if it's a problem , pay me whenever .
ira_gaines Oh , that's very kind of you , Rick .
rick_allen But l should probably go , get out of everyone's way .
ira_gaines l didn't realise you were in anyone's way .
rick_allen Well , l'm not , it's just l did everything you wanted me to do , so there's no reason for me to be here .
not_available Tell you what .
ira_gaines l've got a couple more things for you to do , and then we can talk about when you can go .
ira_gaines This is taking too long , Jack .
jack_bauer l can't just switch the cards .
jack_bauer lt'll attract attention that'll be bad for us both .
ira_gaines You've got three minutes to make this happen .
not_available Fine , l'll do it .
jack_bauer l just need to make it look natural when l go down to the work station .
ira_gaines Drop the pen and shred the paper .
ira_gaines That's right , Jack .
ira_gaines l'm watching you .
ira_gaines Shred the note now or your daughter dies .
not_available What happened ?
nina_myers l was telling you something important
not_available and you just walk away .
not_available l'm sorry .
not_available What did you wanna tell me ?
nina_myers l think Milo's about to identify the shooter .
not_available That's great .
nina_myers We just need a few minutes with the card .
not_available Switch it , Jack .
ira_gaines No more excuses .
jack_bauer Um Look , that's terrific .
jack_bauer Uh Tell Milo to wait until l get down there .

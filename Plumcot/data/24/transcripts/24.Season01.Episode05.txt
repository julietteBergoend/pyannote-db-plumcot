not_available Why? Because the press is gonna get a hold of this, whether it's today, tomorrow or next week.
not_available Nicole should be prepared.
not_available l thought you said Carl would take care of it.
not_available He'll do what he can, but l don't want her to suddenly hear something on the news.
not_available She'd be devastated.
not_available She's so happy right now, David.
not_available We've gotta take it one step at a time.
not_available Dad, it's ready.
not_available Dad, l've figured it all out.

not_available Actually, tonight.
not_available Ah, that's great.
not_available What were you gonna say? Nothin'.
not_available CTU, this is Myers.
not_available Mason looking overyour shoulder? No.
not_available He ended the lockdown as soon as he found out where you were.
not_available Be careful.
not_available He'll come after you.
not_available l'm at the precinct.
not_available They've got a ring around the suspect.
not_available l need help.
not_available Get Ryan Sealey over at District.
not_available Say it's about Palmer and l need an override.
not_available OK.
not_available l'll take care of it.
not_available Damn it.
not_available Tony, l'm still off the net.
not_available l need a contact number for Ryan Sealey at District Two.
not_available Sure.
not_available You still pissed off about the lockdown? Jack's never gonna trust you again, and l'm not sure l will either.
not_available You don't trust me, but you trust Jack? Come on, Nina.
not_available He's been lying.
not_available He's been hiding things from us.
not_available lt may be OK for you, but it's not OK for me.
not_available Do you have the number? Thank you.
not_available Sorry, but this guy killed a cop.
not_available l won't interfere with booking protocol.
not_available l told you 
not_available you'll get a call from Ryan Sealey, our liaison to the PD's office.
not_available Until then, you can have my badge, my gun, and l will not interfere.
not_available But l need to see that man now.
not_available What can l tell you? 
not_available Fine.
not_available Where's your lieutenant? 
not_available He checked out.
not_available Midnight.
not_available But if he was here, he'd tell you the same thing.
not_available Sergeant, the cop that was killed tonight, Officer Hampton.
not_available Did you know her? 
not_available l knew her.
not_available l'm investigating a federal case.
not_available She was helping me.
not_available Do you want her death to be in vain? Please forget about the damn chain of command.
not_available l need to see this man now.
not_available Just for a few minutes.
not_available Please.
not_available Where's the suspect? Move him to room two.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Follow me.
not_available Hold it, Sergeant.
not_available This man's under my authority.
not_available We shouldn't have let him take her! There's two of us, one of him, and we got a gun.
not_available You don't wanna pull a piece on Mr Gaines.
not_available No? Just on girls? lf you had the hots for her, then you should have done something.
not_available l just don't want her to get hurt.
not_available Get real, dude.
not_available She saw our faces.
not_available She saw his face.
not_available She's not walking.
not_available She never was.
not_available You think he's gonna kill her? 
not_available Maybe he already has.
not_available Rick.
not_available Dude.
not_available Come on.
not_available lt's ten grand apiece.
not_available All right? We just wanna get paid and get going.
not_available Forget Kimberly, man.
not_available She's history.
not_available Listen, till you can tell me what you were doing at Dunlop Plaza with Richard Walsh, 
not_available l'm treating you as a prime suspect.
not_available Why would l kill my only ally at the agency? You tell me.
not_available Why'd you blow the whistle on your own agents, and try to blackmail me? Because you were with holding vital information.
not_available l was following orders.
not_available l realise that's a concept you may be unfamiliar with, Jack, but it's something that some of us actually do take seriously.
not_available Through there is a suspect who is connected with the people who want Palmer dead.
not_available How do you know? Walsh and Baylor died because they got information that led me to him.
not_available And if you interfere now and something happens to Palmer, you'll be seen as impeding this investigation cos of a grudge against me, so cut the crap.
not_available How do you wanna play this? 
not_available l'll talk to him myself.
not_available Look, you're lucky l haven't already put you in cuffs.
not_available Just sit down.
not_available Gaines.
not_available Have you heard from him? No.
not_available l'm gonna be calling him in about l've got the girl and we're on our way to the compound right now.
not_available Gotta go.
not_available Stop, please.
not_available Listen, l don't have time for this, you understand? 
not_available Maureen, it's David Palmer.
not_available Senator? 
not_available l'm sorry to wake you.
not_available Oh, no, no, that's OK.
not_available What's up? 
not_available The matter you called about earlier.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available We need to talk about it.
not_available OK.
not_available Um let's talk.
not_available Since we're just a few floors apart, l was thinking maybe we could get together.
not_available OK.
not_available How about l meetyou in the lobby? 
not_available No, no.
not_available The lobby's too public.
not_available The conference room on the third floor 
not_available l'll have it opened.
not_available ljust need about ten minutes to get dressed.
not_available How does that sound? 
not_available Yeah, that's good.
not_available l'll see you in ten.
not_available Thanks, Maureen.
not_available Sure.
not_available And those are the only places you know they were? Yes.
not_available What about this boy, uh, Dan, who works at the furniture store? We don't know anything about him, but the store owner's a Mr Nowrasteh.
not_available l have his number in here somewhere.
not_available Here you are.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Hello? 
not_available Hey, it's me.
not_available ls Janet out of surgery yet? Yeah.
not_available The police showed up.
not_available We're talking to them now.

not_available No.
not_available How about you? l'm at the Van Nuys police station.
not_available Someone here knows where the girls were tonight.
not_available You mean one of the police officers? 
not_available No.
not_available They picked him up in North Hollywood.
not_available l think he saw Kim.
not_available Who? 
not_available l don't know.
not_available A man.
not_available Well, what did he say? l'm waiting to talk to him.
not_available You've gotta talk to Janet as soon as she gets out of surgery, OK? l know.
not_available l know, l know.
not_available l'll call you as soon as l can.
not_available l gotta go.
not_available Bye.
not_available So what did he say? 
not_available He says he won't talk to anybody except you.
not_available So, can l go in? Yeah.
not_available Thank you.
not_available My colleague said you only wanted to speak to me.
not_available Well, here l am.
not_available And guess what? 
not_available Right now, you're speaking to everyone.
not_available What the hell is he doing? 
not_available l thought we were going to talk alone.
not_available You killed a cop.
not_available What you need to do right now is start telling me the truth.
not_available lt was self
not_available defence.
not_available You were chasing me.
not_available What's he saying? Go to hell! l'm done talking.
not_available Get this guy outta my face! 
not_available You've got nothing.
not_available l want my lawyer! 
not_available Settle down.
not_available l'll take him.
not_available Come on.
not_available l want my phone call.
not_available You've got nothing! l want my phone call, now! 
not_available Jack.
not_available Great job.
not_available He knows something.
not_available So are you gonna beat it out of him? What's the plan, Jack? Hm? What's the plan? Take a walk.
not_available Bauer.
not_available ls this line safe? 
not_available Tell me about my daughter.
not_available Not till you get me out.
not_available How do you know where she is? 
not_available l heard some guys talking.
not_available Guys l work with.
not_available What guys? 
not_available All you need to know is they have her.
not_available They're gonna call me in 20 minutes.
not_available Where? 
not_available Back where you first saw me.
not_available San Fernando Road? Yeah.
not_available But if l don't answer, they'll know something's wrong, so get me out.
not_available l don't know if l can.
not_available l'm the one chance you got to find her.
not_available l'm not there for that call, the chance is over.
not_available Better think of something fast.
not_available CTU.
not_available This is Myers.
not_available Hey.
not_available lt's Jack.
not_available The suspect's name is Penticoff.
not_available He's expecting a call in 20 minutes at 18166 San Fernando Road.
not_available l need you to trace all available public lines.
not_available l see water lines, utilities, no phone lines.
not_available Keep looking.
not_available He said he'd get the call there.
not_available Wait.
not_available There's a pay phone halfway down the block.
not_available And it's in service.
not_available Set up a trace.
not_available There's not enough time for a warrant.
not_available Forget the warrant! lf they're expecting Penticoff, they'll hang up when they hear your voice.
not_available They won't.
not_available They'll hear Penticoff's.
not_available Did Mason get him out? 
not_available No.
not_available So what are you planning? A jailbreak? Jack? Set up the trace.
not_available Bauer's behaviour is far from representative of this agency's work.
not_available Whether you like it or not, we have to be involved, because this is bigger than Hey.
not_available Are you the officer that interviewed Penticoff? 
not_available No, l just transferred him to a holding cell.
not_available l still need to see him.
not_available You Bauer from CTU? 
not_available Yeah, that's right.
not_available Look, the cop that he killed, she was my partner, you understand? 
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available l heard you went off on him before.
not_available l want him to go down for it, which means a clean bust.
not_available No more extracurricular activities.
not_available Understood.
not_available All right.
not_available But l've got the access card.
not_available Now, you can go in with me or you don't go in.
not_available l'm fine with that.
not_available Keep him away from me.
not_available Just a few more questions.
not_available No more questions without my lawyer.
not_available Who are you working for? 
not_available Are you deaf? l said no questions without my lawyer.
not_available Your lawyer can kiss my ass.
not_available Oh, yeah? Who do you work for? Hey, hey! Back off! 
not_available Get your hands off of me.
not_available He killed my partner! 
not_available l know.
not_available l was there.
not_available Where were you? What? Where were you when your partner really needed you? Hey! Get him outta here! What the hell's the matter with you? 
not_available He's crazy.
not_available l'm filing charges.
not_available You oughta get yourself under control, Bauer.
not_available What's going on? l'll take care of it.
not_available Paediatric resident to Labour and Delivery.
not_available Paediatric resident to Labour and Delivery.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available l l didn't mean to wake you.
not_available l wasn't asleep.
not_available l thought you might like some coffee.
not_available Thank you.
not_available She'll turn up.
not_available How's Janet? Um They're relieving some pressure on her spine.
not_available But she's gonna be OK.
not_available At least, that's what they say.
not_available Of course she will.
not_available Any news from Jack? No.
not_available As far as l know, he's still out looking for Kim.
not_available Well, that's good.
not_available You said he has resources the police don't have, right? Even so, um l imagine you wish he were here.
not_available Hands out, please.
not_available Turn around.
not_available Oh, enough.
not_available Maureen's an old friend.
not_available lt's all right.
not_available He's just doing his job.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Your lD, ma'am.
not_available Would you excuse us? How long have we known each other, Maureen? Come on, Senator.
not_available That's not fair.
not_available No, l'm just saying.
not_available You, me, my family.
not_available We made a journey together, from local politics to where we are now.
not_available We helped each other along, because we cared about the same things.
not_available l know that.
not_available Have l ever lied to you? 
not_available No.
not_available Embarrassed you? 
not_available No.
not_available Then why are you doing this? Senator, l wish to God that l didn't get this information.
not_available But we're talking about murder.
not_available A rumour.
not_available Started by my enemies, of whom, as you well know, l have many.
not_available That's what l thought too, at first.
not_available But Please.
not_available Go on.
not_available You know l can't tell you my sources.
not_available Come on, Maureen.
not_available We're not in court here.
not_available l'm just an old friend, with a career and family that you just may destroy.
not_available You owe me that much, at least.
not_available OK.
not_available Two sources.
not_available One, a man named George Ferragamo.
not_available He was your son's therapist for four years.
not_available He came to me with the story.
not_available And the second source? The boy who raped your daughter, then threw himself off the balcony 
not_available Lyle Gibson? His autopsy showed that he had cuts and scratches that pointed to ''a violent struggle''.
not_available Nicole tried to fight him off.
not_available Yes, that was the explanation.
not_available But an hour later, an African
not_available American teenage boy went to an emergency room, one block away, with similar injuries.
not_available The name here says Edward Johnson.
not_available The handwriting where he filled out the form and signed his name? l had it analysed by an expert.
not_available lt's your son's.
not_available l don't give a damn about your expert.
not_available My son never killed anybody.
not_available Senator, l would never 
not_available You do what you have to do, Maureen.
not_available Just be prepared to accept the consequences.
not_available .<br>.<br>truth in the rumour that the Pentagon wastefully dumped military supplies costing millions, perhaps billions, of taxpayer dollars in the years since the Vietnam War started.
not_available The spokesman, who declined to be interviewed on camera, states only that ''in the hurly
not_available burly of war and the constant movement of perimeters and people, one must expect that there would be a certain amount of acceptable loss of supplies and armaments.<br>'' Hey, Dad.
not_available Somethin' wrong? l guess you'll have to tell me.
not_available The night your sister was raped, did you have any contact with the boy who raped her? What? 
not_available You heard me.
not_available l l don't believe this.
not_available l mean What brought this up all of a sudden? l mean, let's just leave that all in the past where it belongs.
not_available l'd like to, believe me.
not_available But, as it happens, l can't.
not_available What did you do that night, after you found out that Nicole had been attacked? The truth, now.
not_available All of it.
not_available l don't think you have a right to ask me that.
not_available You don't think l have the right? 
not_available No, l don't.
not_available See, this thing happened.
not_available Somebody had to deal with it.
not_available But you were in Chicago givin' a speech, or New York We'll deal with my shortcomings as a father later.
not_available Now l wanna know what you did after you found out your sister had been raped.
not_available And l told you.
not_available l'm not gonna answer.
not_available You will answer me! l apologise about Bauer.
not_available But l'd really appreciate it if we could handle this internally.
not_available l got no problem with that.
not_available Sergeant, excuse me, but if our federal colleagues are through with Penticoff, 
not_available l'd like to process him into the system.
not_available Why are you here? l thought you left.
not_available l'm not leaving till Penticoff is behind bars without bail.
not_available The computer says you left five minutes ago.
not_available All right, guys, we're on the move.
not_available Damn it! l got this notice in the mail this afternoon.
not_available Actually, it was yesterday afternoon.
not_available Kimberly was failing algebra.
not_available lt was the second notice.
not_available She intercepted the first one and threw it away.
not_available When she got home, l was so mad at her.
not_available l guess l accused her, and l l said things to her l shouldn't have said.
not_available There isn't a parent in the world who hasn't been there.
not_available Last night, when l told her good night, she wouldn't even acknowledge me.
not_available l actually had the thought that l'd be l'd be so glad when she got out of the house.
not_available When Janet wakes up, she'll know where Kim is and then we'll find her.
not_available l just hope it'll be that easy.
not_available lt will.
not_available But why wasn't she with Janet? lt doesn't make any sense.
not_available Maybe she got freaked out by the accident.
not_available We should've waited.
not_available We should've waited.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available We were right to come here.
not_available All we had to go on was the ambulance.
not_available We had to follow up on it.
not_available Listen, whatever happens, l'm gonna stay with you until we find Kim.
not_available You have my promise.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Come on, Davis, we need that uplink.
not_available He says we oughta have a picture by now.
not_available W
not_available 7 satellite was in the southwest sector when Bauer helped Penticoff escape, so, with luck, we'll be able to pull up some visuals that'll help us pinpoint his location.
not_available That's it.
not_available Here we go.
not_available All right.
not_available Davis, the link's up.
not_available Now l gotta get a back trace.
not_available This is the roof of the building from 200 miles up.
not_available About how long would you say since they got out? l don't know.
not_available Seven or eight minutes? OK.
not_available Davis? l wanna go back ten minutes, and give me stills at 30
not_available second intervals.
not_available Look for two men exiting the building together.
not_available As often minutes ago 30 
not_available There they are.
not_available OK, you can speed it up.
not_available All right.
not_available Speeding up.
not_available Slow it down now.
not_available You got it.
not_available You got a mark on that car? 
not_available Coming to you now.
not_available All right.
not_available Where are you headed, Jack? All set? 
not_available All set.
not_available How much time do you need? 
not_available A few seconds.
not_available Who are these guys? 
not_available l told you.
not_available l don't know.
not_available They tell me what to do.
not_available l do it, they pay me.
not_available That's it.
not_available lt's ringing.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available l'm not showing anything.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available lt's a cellphone.
not_available We're screwed.
not_available l don't know the frequency.
not_available l'll get back to you.
not_available Jack? Yeah? 
not_available lt's Gaines.
not_available There's a change of plan.
not_available Nothing you can't handle.
not_available Taped to the back of the phone is a set of keys with a remote.
not_available Got 'em.
not_available lt's for a parked car on Avenue 26.
not_available Nevada plates, 782NOF.
not_available Find it with the remote.
not_available There's a body in the trunk.
not_available Get rid of it.

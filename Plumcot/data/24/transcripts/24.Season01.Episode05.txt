not_available Fine .
not_available Where's your lieutenant ?
not_available He checked out .

not_available Sergeant , the cop that was killed tonight , Officer Hampton .
not_available Did you know her ?
not_available l knew her .
not_available l'm investigating a federal case .
not_available She was helping me .
not_available Do you want her death to be in vain ?
not_available Please forget about the damn chain of command .
not_available l need to see this man now .
not_available Just for a few minutes .
not_available Please .
not_available Where's the suspect ?
not_available Move him to room two .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Follow me .
not_available Hold it , Sergeant .
not_available This man's under my authority .

not_available You don't wanna pull a piece on Mr Gaines .
not_available No ?
not_available Just on girls ?
not_available lf you had the hots for her , then you should have done something .
not_available l
not_available just don't want her to get hurt .
not_available Get real , dude .
not_available She saw our faces .
not_available She saw his face .
not_available She's not walking .
not_available She never was .
not_available You think he's gonna kill her ?

not_available Rick .
not_available Dude .
not_available Come on .
not_available lt's ten grand apiece .
not_available All right ?
not_available We just wanna get paid and get going .
not_available Forget Kimberly , man .
not_available She's history .
not_available Listen , till you can tell me what you were doing at Dunlop Plaza with Richard Walsh , l'm treating you as a prime suspect .
not_available Why would l kill my only ally at the agency ?
not_available You tell me .
not_available Why'd you blow the whistle on your own agents , and try to blackmail me ?
not_available Because you were with holding vital information .
not_available l was following orders .
not_available l realise
not_available that's a concept you may be unfamiliar with , Jack , but it's something that some of us actually do take seriously .
not_available Through there is a suspect who is connected with the people who want Palmer dead .
not_available How do you know ?
not_available Walsh and Baylor died because they got information that led me to him .
not_available And if you interfere now and something happens to Palmer , you'll be seen as impeding this investigation cos of a grudge against me , so cut the crap .
not_available How do you wanna play this ?
not_available l'll talk to him myself .
not_available Look , you're lucky l haven't already put you in cuffs .
not_available Just sit down .
not_available Gaines .
not_available Have you heard from him ?
not_available No .
not_available l'm gonna be calling him in about l've
not_available got the girl
not_available and we're on our way to the compound right now .

not_available A jailbreak ?
not_available Jack ?

not_available Bauer's behaviour is far from representative of this agency's work .

not_available No , l just transferred him to a holding cell .
not_available l still need to see him .
not_available You Bauer from CTU ?

not_available Come on , Senator .
not_available That's not fair .
not_available No , l'm just saying .
not_available You , me , my family .
not_available We made a journey together , from local politics to where we are now .
not_available We helped each other along , because we cared about the same things .
not_available l know that .
not_available Have l ever lied to you ?
not_available No .
not_available Embarrassed you ?
not_available No .
not_available Then why are you doing this ?
not_available Senator , l wish to God that l didn't get this information .
not_available But we're talking about murder .
not_available A rumour .
not_available Started by my enemies , of whom , as you well know , l have many .
not_available That's what l thought too , at first .
not_available But Please .
not_available Go on .
not_available You know l can't tell you my sources .
not_available Come on , Maureen .
not_available We're not in court here .
not_available l'm just an old friend , with a career and family that you just may destroy .
not_available You owe me that much , at least .
not_available OK .
not_available Two sources .
not_available One , a man named George Ferragamo .
not_available He was your son's therapist for four years .
not_available He came to me with the story .
not_available And the second source ?
not_available The boy who raped your daughter , then threw himself off the balcony Lyle Gibson ?
not_available His autopsy showed that he had cuts and scratches that pointed to ''a violent struggle'' .
not_available Nicole tried to fight him off .
not_available Yes , that was the explanation .
not_available But an hour later , an African American teenage boy went to an emergency room , one block away , with similar injuries .
not_available The name here says Edward Johnson .
not_available The handwriting where he filled out the form and signed his name ?
not_available l had it analysed by an expert .
not_available lt's your son's .
not_available l don't give a damn about your expert .
not_available My son never killed anybody .
not_available Senator , l would never You do what you have to do , Maureen .
not_available Just be prepared to accept the consequences .
not_available .<br>.<br
not_available >truth in the rumour that the Pentagon wastefully dumped military supplies costing millions , perhaps billions , of taxpayer dollars in the years since the Vietnam War started .
not_available The spokesman , who declined to be interviewed on camera , states only that ''in the hurly burly of war and the constant movement of perimeters and people , one must expect that there would be a certain amount of acceptable loss of supplies and armaments.<br>''
not_available Hey , Dad .
not_available Somethin' wrong ?
not_available l guess you'll have to tell me .
not_available The night your sister was raped , did you have any contact with the boy who raped her ?
not_available What ?
not_available You heard me .
not_available l l don't believe this .
not_available l mean
not_available What brought this up all of a sudden ?
not_available l mean , let's just leave that all in the past where it belongs .
not_available l'd like to , believe me .
not_available But , as it happens , l can't .
not_available What did you do that night , after you found out that Nicole had been attacked ?
not_available The truth , now .
not_available All of it .
not_available l don't think you have a right to ask me that .
not_available You don't think l have the right ?
not_available No , l don't .
not_available See , this thing happened .
not_available Somebody had to deal with it .
not_available But you were in Chicago givin' a speech , or New York
not_available We'll deal with my shortcomings as a father later .
not_available Now l wanna know what you did after you found out your sister had been raped .
not_available And l told you .
not_available l'm not gonna answer .
not_available You will answer me !
not_available l apologise about Bauer .
not_available But l'd really appreciate it if we could handle this internally .
not_available l got no problem with that .
not_available Sergeant , excuse me , but if our federal colleagues are through with Penticoff , l'd like to process him into the system .
not_available Why are you here ?
not_available l thought you left .
not_available l'm not leaving till Penticoff is behind bars without bail .
not_available The computer says you left five minutes ago .
not_available All right , guys , we're on the move .
not_available Damn it !
not_available l got this notice in the mail this afternoon .
not_available Actually , it was yesterday afternoon .
not_available Kimberly was failing algebra .
not_available lt was the second notice .
not_available She intercepted the first one and threw it away .
not_available When she got home , l was so mad at her .
not_available l guess l accused her , and l l said things to her l
not_available shouldn't have said .
not_available There isn't a parent in the world who hasn't been there .
not_available Last night , when l told her good night , she wouldn't even acknowledge me .
not_available l actually had the thought that l'd be l'd be so glad when she got out of the house .
not_available When Janet wakes up , she'll know where Kim is
not_available and then we'll find her .
not_available l just hope it'll be that easy .
not_available lt will .
not_available But why wasn't she with Janet ?
not_available lt doesn't make any sense .
not_available Maybe she got freaked out by the accident .
not_available We should've waited .
not_available We should've waited .
not_available No , no , no .
not_available We were right to come here .
not_available All we had to go on was the ambulance .
not_available We had to follow up on it .
not_available Listen , whatever happens , l'm gonna stay with you until we find Kim .
not_available You have my promise .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Come on , Davis , we need that uplink .
not_available He says we oughta have a picture by now .
not_available W 7 satellite was in the southwest sector when Bauer helped Penticoff escape , so , with luck , we'll be able to pull up some visuals that'll help us pinpoint his location .
not_available That's it .
not_available Here we go .
not_available All right .
not_available Davis , the link's up .
not_available Now l gotta get a back trace .
not_available This is the roof of the building from 200 miles up .
not_available About how long would you say since they got out ?
not_available l don't know .
not_available Seven or eight minutes ?
not_available OK .
not_available Davis ?
not_available l wanna go back ten minutes , and give me stills at 30 second intervals .
not_available Look for two men exiting the building together .
not_available As often minutes ago 30 There they are .
not_available OK , you can speed it up .

not_available Slow it down now .
not_available You got it .

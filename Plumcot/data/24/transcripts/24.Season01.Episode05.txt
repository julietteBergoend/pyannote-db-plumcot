george_mason that's a concept you may be unfamiliar with , Jack , but it's something that some of us actually do take seriously .
jack_bauer Through there is a suspect who is connected with the people who want Palmer dead .
not_available How do you know ?
jack_bauer Walsh and Baylor died because they got information that led me to him .
jack_bauer And if you interfere now and something happens to Palmer , you'll be seen as impeding this investigation cos of a grudge against me , so cut the crap .

not_available But Please .
president_david_palmer Go on .
maureen_kingsley You know l can't tell you my sources .
not_available Come on , Maureen .
not_available We're not in court here .
president_david_palmer l'm just an old friend , with a career and family that you just may destroy .
president_david_palmer You owe me that much , at least .
not_available OK .
not_available Two sources .
maureen_kingsley One , a man named George Ferragamo .
maureen_kingsley He was your son's therapist for four years .
maureen_kingsley He came to me with the story .
president_david_palmer And the second source ?
maureen_kingsley The boy who raped your daughter , then threw himself off the balcony Lyle Gibson ?
maureen_kingsley His autopsy showed that he had cuts and scratches that pointed to ''a violent struggle'' .
not_available Nicole tried to fight him off .
maureen_kingsley Yes , that was the explanation .
maureen_kingsley But an hour later , an African American teenage boy went to an emergency room , one block away , with similar injuries .
president_david_palmer The name here says Edward Johnson .
maureen_kingsley The handwriting where he filled out the form and signed his name ?
maureen_kingsley l had it analysed by an expert .
not_available lt's your son's .
president_david_palmer l don't give a damn about your expert .
president_david_palmer My son never killed anybody .
maureen_kingsley Senator , l would never You do what you have to do , Maureen .
president_david_palmer Just be prepared to accept the consequences .
maureen_kingsley truth in the rumour that the Pentagon wastefully dumped military supplies costing millions , perhaps billions , of taxpayer dollars in the years since the Vietnam War started .
maureen_kingsley The spokesman , who declined to be interviewed on camera , states only that ''in the hurly burly of war and the constant movement of perimeters and people , one must expect that there would be a certain amount of acceptable loss of supplies and armaments.
not_available Hey , Dad .
not_available Somethin' wrong ?
president_david_palmer l guess you'll have to tell me .

president_david_palmer But , as it happens , l can't .
president_david_palmer What did you do that night , after you found out that Nicole had been attacked ?
not_available The truth , now .
keith_palmer All of it .
keith_palmer l don't think you have a right to ask me that .
president_david_palmer You don't think l have the right ?
not_available No , l don't .
not_available See , this thing happened .
keith_palmer Somebody had to deal with it .
keith_palmer But you were in Chicago givin' a speech , or New York

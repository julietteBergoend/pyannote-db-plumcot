jack_bauer Richard Walsh is dead .
not_available What ?
not_available He was shot .

not_available You trust Jamey ?
not_available He did .
not_available I trust you .

george_mason You know what your reputation is now ?
not_available Jack's flunky .
not_available His lap dog .
george_mason This is your chance to get back on track , Nina .
not_available He's a loose cannon .
george_mason Rules don't apply to Jack Bauer .
george_mason He does what he wants , when he wants
george_mason and he doesn't care whose life it affects .
george_mason He shot me with a tranq gun here in the office , for God's sakes .
nina_myers That's because you withheld crucial information .
not_available I was following orders .
nina_myers Maybe he's following orders .
nina_myers Orders you don't know about .
george_mason He violated lockdown and left you holding the bag .
george_mason If he cared about you , he wouldn't have put you in that position .
not_available Let me ask you
not_available would you have done that to him ?
george_mason The fact is , I'm just asking you to do your job and tell me where he is .
not_available I don't know .

sherry_palmer I'd call this unprofessional .
sherry_palmer David you can't seriously think that our son might be a killer ?

not_available Of course not .

not_available Please ?
not_available was placed at that location , approximately 30 minutes ago .

george_mason Don't be naive .
not_available Sit .
george_mason Let me tell you how the game is played .
george_mason First thing they do is to tell you that you're the only one they can trust .
george_mason That's flattering and it makes you trust them in return .
not_available Right ?
george_mason Then they get you to do something you shouldn't .
george_mason Say you don't know where Jack went , for example .
george_mason Then the next thing you know , Jack's gone Nina's stonewalling , and you're in the hot seat .
not_available Sound familiar ?
not_available You're being used .
george_mason I've seen it a million times .
george_mason If you help me out , I'll help you out .

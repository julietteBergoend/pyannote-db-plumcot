NARRATOR Previously on Battlestar Galactica .
N .
HELO What the hell is going on ?
HELO You killed her .
not_available We gotta go .
not_available Right now .
BILLY That's Tom Zarek .
DUALLA The terrorist ?
BILLY He's a prisoner of conscience .
DUALLA He's a butcher .
not_available He blew up a government building , there is no excuse for that .
not_available I thought you said you respected me .
not_available That was before you resorted to violence and hostage taking .
ZAREK I demand the immediate resignation of Laura Roslin and her ministers .
not_available I demand free and open elections to choose a new leadership .
not_available If you let the rest of these hostages go , we will leave this ship in your hands .
McMANUS Got it ?
MAN Test .
not_available There .
McMANUS Are we on ?
MAN Frack , we're on .
not_available Go .
McMANUS Live from Cloud Nine , the most luxurious ship in the fleet
McMANUS it's The Colonial Gang .
not_available It's a new talk show that brings you the inside scoop on the fleet .
not_available I'm James McManus , formerly of the Caprica Times .
not_available With me are two of the only remaining legitimate journalists left .
not_available Playa Palacios , veteran commentator for the Picon Star Tribune .
not_available Welcome .
not_available And my wingman , Sekou Hamilton , former editor of the Aerilon Gazette .
not_available As most people know Cloud Nine was damaged during a Cylon attack and had to be evacuated .
not_available With repairs now complete , President Roslin has picked it as the site for an historic gathering .
not_available It's the first meeting of the Interim Quorum of 12 which will coincide with Colonial Day the 52nd anniversary of the signing of the Articles of Colonisation .
not_available Playa , why don't you weigh in ?
not_available Laura Roslin should be applauded for restoring the system of checks and balances .
McMANUS Every delegate chosen so far has been a Roslin crony .
not_available It's a puppet Quorum , okay ?
not_available That will rubberstamp every edict this powermad schoolteacher will try How can you say that when half the Quorum hasn't even been selected ?
McMANUS I predict every one of them will be a Roslin lackey hand
not_available picked by the power behind the throne , Presidential Advisor , Wallace Gray .
not_available Don't you see , Gray orchestrated this whole publicity stunt .
not_available Come on , Jim .
not_available Wallace Gray is no prince of darkness .
not_available I disagree .
not_available He's helped Roslin regulate the internal economy made sure vital food and medical supplies
not_available were fairly distributed He's a gasbag who's made a fortune through deals Quorum members have profited from .
ROSLIN Freedom of the press .
McMANUS As we speak Madam President , the fatuous gasbag would like 5 minutes of your time .
not_available Wally .
ROSLIN How does it feel to be a celebrity ?
GRAY Well , I love it .
not_available They'll probably be calling me a fascist next .
not_available No , I'm the fascist .
not_available You stick with being the gasbag .
not_available Madam President , excuse me , you're going to want to hear this .
McMANUS Sagittaron have chosen their delegate for the Interim Quorum of 12 .
not_available Who would've guessed it ?
not_available Tom Zarek .
not_available Oh , my gods .
not_available He's got quite a following out there .
not_available I should have seen this coming .
not_available He's a terrorist .
not_available Who are they kidding ?
McMANUS a ruthless terrorist .
HAMILTON Tom Zarek incited a prison riot that resulted in kidnapping , attempted rape .
not_available He blew up a government building and now he's gonna sit on the Quorum of 12 ?
McMANUS Wrong .
not_available The government trumped up charges to discredit a man who's dedicated his life for the disenfranchised .
not_available Yes ?
not_available Just a moment .
not_available Commander Adama .
not_available Why am I not surprised ?
ROSLIN Hello , Commander .
ADAMA Are you listening to this ?
not_available Indeed .
not_available Can't allow a terrorist to sit in government .
ROSLIN My hands are tied .
not_available I don't want to turn him into a martyr .
not_available Sagittaron law allows a prisoner to regain his citizenship once he's served his time .
not_available Tom Zarek represents a danger to the entire fleet .
not_available I can bar him from travelling to Cloud Nine on that basis alone .
not_available I perfectly understand the threat Tom Zarek represents .
not_available But the last thing I need is for you to start acting like my own personal goon squad .
not_available We need to let this play out .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Hold onto your shorts .
not_available There's another story .
not_available We're getting a live feed from the Astral Queen .
not_available Tom Zarek is about to make a statement .
ZAREK Citizens of the 12 Colonies , I am humbled and moved by this great honour .
not_available I will be a voice for those who have gone too long unheard by a government that serves only the privileged and the powerful that turns a blind eye to the needs of the weak and the poor .
not_available But Roslin and her confederates will no longer be able to ignore us .
not_available People of the fleet , look up .
not_available The winds of change are blowing .
not_available A new era is about to dawn .
not_available Hey , Doc .
not_available Lt .
not_available Thrace , to what do I owe this honour ?
not_available Our shuttle leaves for Cloud Nine at 05:12 tomorrow , so don't be late .
not_available " Our " shuttle ?
not_available A surprise getaway ?
not_available Just the two of you ?
not_available I'm going to be handling your security .
not_available Please don't touch that .
not_available Thank you .
BALTAR Security for what ?
STARBUCK You haven't heard ?
STARBUCK It's all over talk wireless .
not_available When would I have the chance to listen to talk wireless ?
not_available I have 60 years of work in front of me .
not_available Anyway , talk wireless is just an excuse for lowbrow rabble rousing .
not_available You've been selected as Caprica's delegate to the Quorum of 12 .
not_available Me ?
not_available Is this some kind of joke ?
not_available Guess you got the super genius vote .
not_available No accounting for taste .
STARBUCK Congratulations , Doctor .
BALTAR Thank you .
not_available Politics is the only thing more boring than blood samples .
not_available All those interminable speeches .
not_available All that dreary pomp .
not_available Parties full of young women drawn to men of power .
not_available But when the people call , you must serve .
APOLLO I can't remember the last time I felt the sunlight on my face .
not_available Sure feels good .
not_available Almost like the real thing .
STARBUCK They could've done a better job with the horizon , though .
not_available Security's going to be a bitch .
not_available A thousand different places for a sniper to hide .
not_available How many people are we dealing with ?
APOLLO Five hundred plus .
APOLLO Each colony's sending a delegation of leading citizens .
not_available Great .
not_available Herds of lookie loos , any one of whom could be a Cylon .
APOLLO Toasters aren't our only problem .
not_available Don't you pay any attention to politics ?
not_available No .
not_available A lot of unrest out there .
not_available So why is Roslin insisting on letting so many people come ?
not_available I guess she thinks it's important to them to be able to observe how their government works .
not_available So basically , she's already running for re election .
APOLLO No , Kara .
APOLLO Kara , give me that .
AGENT Thank you , sir .
not_available Enjoy your day .
PALACIOS The atmosphere is electric as Quorum members arrive with their delegations .
not_available I'm outside the Cloud Nine Ballroom where the reception of the new Quorum of 12 will take place .
not_available The question is , will President Roslin shake the hand of the man many still regard as a terrorist or will she snub him , and by extension , all the people of Sagittaron ?
not_available Col . Tigh .
not_available My wife Ellen .
not_available Welcome aboard .
not_available Kill me now .
not_available Col . Tigh .
APOLLO Starbuck , Apollo .
not_available Zarek's here .
STARBUCK Copy .
STARBUCK Don't worry .
not_available This guy's mine the second he makes a wrong move .
not_available Yeah ?
not_available Well , you'll have to beat me to him .
not_available Murderer .
not_available You don't belong here , Zarek .
not_available Go back .
GRIMES What did you say ?
GRIMES He's not a murderer , he's a freedom fighter .
GRIMES All right ?
APOLLO Excuse me .
not_available May I see your security pass , sir ?
not_available Not a problem .
not_available I'm a citizen of Sagittaron .
not_available I've got every legal right to be here .
not_available Your rights don't extend to roughing people up .
not_available Lay a hand on anyone else
not_available and you'll be getting to know Galactica's brig .
APOLLO Well , everything's in order .
not_available Enjoy your stay on Cloud Nine .
not_available Oh , I will .
ZAREK Tom Zarek .
TIGH Col .
not_available Tigh , Battlestar Galactica .
not_available I see .
not_available My wife .
not_available Does she have a name ?
not_available Ellen .
ZAREK Call me Tom .
not_available I don't like to stand on ceremony .
not_available I'm the same way .
not_available All this pretension makes me sick .
not_available You're holding up the line .
not_available Thank you for making me feel welcome , Ellen .
not_available I hope to see you again .
not_available Why did you do that ?
not_available To get our picture on the front page of every newsletter and photo service in the fleet .
not_available I don't need my picture taken with a terrorist .
not_available Wake up , Saul .
not_available Look at these cameras .
not_available Roslin's the past , Zarek's the future .
not_available A blind man can see that .
ZAREK Madam President .
ROSLIN Mr .
not_available Zarek .
not_available If I were to offer you my hand in friendship would you take it ?
not_available Well , there's only one way to find out .
ZAREK That was nicely played .
ROSLIN Thank you .
not_available Just remember , I'm not your enemy , Madam President .
ROSLIN And I know today's agenda is rather large
ROSLIN but I think that if you'll look at the scheduled meetings you'll see that they concern issues vital to the fleet .
not_available In some cases , existing policies regarding matters such as the distribution of medical supplies
not_available NO .
6 You're missing an intriguing opportunity .
not_available Playa's not wearing any underwear .
not_available Don't be absurd .
not_available Really ?
not_available She's been eyeing you all afternoon .
not_available She's certainly human .
not_available You're not jealous ?
not_available NO .
6 Love isn't about sex , Gaius .
not_available That's an enlightened point of view .
not_available I've been thinking as far as I'm concerned you can have any woman you want .
not_available But always remember I have your heart .
not_available Yes .
not_available Of course you do .
not_available I can always rip it out of your chest if I need to .
ROSLIN So if there are no objections the Chair will entertain motions to accept today's agenda as proposed .
not_available I have an objection .
not_available The chair recognises Sagittaron .
not_available All the items on your agenda are important , I agree .
not_available Ration distribution , education , medical services , all very important .
not_available But I'm frankly shocked to discover the most critical issue of all is nowhere to be found .
not_available Really ?
not_available Well , perhaps Mr . Zarek could enlighten us ?
not_available The election of a vice president .
not_available lf , gods forbid , anything should happen to you ,
not_available Madam President we have no designated successor .
not_available The civilian branch of our government would be paralysed leaving the door wide open for a military dictatorship .
not_available Sagittaron moves that the first item on the Quorum's agenda should be nominations for vice president .
not_available Second .
not_available Second .
not_available Second .
not_available Caprica seconds for various reasons which are far too obvious and numerous to go into right now .
not_available But certainly , I think we can all agree that it'd be a good idea to have a successor .
not_available The motion has been moved and seconded .
not_available All those in favour of opening nominations for the vice presidency , say aye .
ALL Aye .
not_available Aye .
ROSLIN The ayes have it .
not_available The floor is now open for nominations .
not_available The chair recognises Virgon .
not_available Now , there is only one man here who is willing to work for the betterment of people in this fleet .
not_available When I asked for his help he sent a crew to fix the air filtration system on my ship and , hell , they were finished and gone while I was still waiting for the President's office to return my call .
not_available I nominate Tom Zarek .
not_available Thanks .
not_available Is there a second ?
not_available Gemenon seconds the nomination .
not_available The nomination of Tom Zarek for the vice presidency has been accepted .
not_available The Chair will remain open for 72 hours for nominations .
not_available The session is now adjourned .
ROSLIN Thomas Zarek is not going to be my vice
not_available president .
not_available Six months until the presidential election .
not_available We could've handpicked a candidate .
not_available It didn't shock me when Bagot nominated him .
not_available But Porter , that was surprising .
not_available Not really .
not_available The Gemenon ships use more water per capita than any other ship .
not_available She wanted more rations , I said no .
not_available Zarek may have made some friends in the last few weeks
not_available but there are still plenty who hate him .
not_available Don't underestimate Zarek .
not_available He's charismatic and knows what buttons to push .
not_available Frankly , Madam President , I am concerned about the security aboard Cloud Nine .
ROSLIN I want you leaning forward on this , Captain .
ROSLIN If they even sneeze , they better have a handkerchief .
not_available Understood .
not_available We need a candidate .
not_available Someone who will quickly win the delegates' support .
not_available An established name .
not_available I'm not a politician .
ROSLIN But you know how to get things done .
not_available You've kept this fleet functioning all this time .
not_available No .
not_available Thanks , but I can't allow Tom Zarek to be one heartbeat away from the presidency , Wally .
ROSLIN I need you .
not_available You've got me , Madam President .
not_available How can you reassure people that you're looking out for their interests as opposed to the rehabilitation of Tom Zarek ?
not_available That's a great question , Playa .
not_available This is how I see it .
not_available We're facing a situation so unique , so specific that I believe we need not only new leadership but a whole new way of thinking .
not_available Like blowing up a building or two ?
ZAREK If things weren't so serious , I'd say that was funny .
not_available Look , there's no economy .
not_available There's no market .
not_available No industry .
not_available No capital .
not_available Money is worthless .
not_available And yet , we're all held hostage by the idea of the way things used to be .
ZAREK Look where we are .
ZAREK This man wakes up every morning tugs on his boots and goes to work in this garden .
not_available Why ?
not_available Because it's his job ?
not_available What job ?
not_available He labours , but he gets no benefit from his labour .
not_available He's not the only one .
not_available Many of us are just still going through the motions of our old lives .
not_available The lawyers still act like lawyers , but they have no clients .
not_available Businessmen still act like businessmen , but have no business .
not_available President Roslin and her policies are all about holding on to a fantasy .
not_available If we want to survive , we need to completely restructure our lives .
not_available We need to think about the community of citizens .
not_available The group , not the individual .
not_available We need to completely free ourselves of the past and operate as a collective .
not_available You're not interested in the citizens .
not_available You just want power .
not_available Turn that crap off .
not_available I was listening to that broadcast .
APOLLO You again ?
APOLLO That's a shame .
not_available They want to hear Mr .
not_available Zarek speak , too .
not_available Don't you , buddy ?
not_available See ?
not_available He wants to hear Mr . Zarek .
not_available How about you ?
not_available You want to hear what Mr . Zarek has to say ?
not_available I don't mind one way or the other .
not_available Well , I take that as a yes .
not_available So turn it on .
not_available Now .
not_available Leave it .
not_available Mr .
not_available Zarek is a representative of the people and we are the people .
not_available Well , you're people .
not_available Sort of .
not_available You know , I don't like your tone , flyboy
not_available so why don't you just move along out of here and go enjoy the imitation weather ?
not_available I'd be happy to , after you leave .
not_available the hell .
not_available Telamon Building's still standing .
not_available infiltrate the most heavily fortified military hub on this planet
not_available hope the Cylons haven't completely wasted the spaceport steal a ship , locate Galactica and fly to her without getting shot to hell .
not_available out of the two women we saw with the Cylons .
not_available That's too weird .
not_available Cloning people or something ?
not_available us by surprise .
not_available laying the groundwork for the surprise attack .
not_available that means they're capable of complex emotions , maybe even love .
not_available Cylons , just like the rest of them .
not_available Why circle every public appearance by President Roslin ?
not_available Falsebottom with anechoic coating to absorb
not_available x Your friend Zarek pointed that out . .
not_available us your executioners .
not_available just came over here for the booze and the food .
not_available what ?
not_available Frack you !
not_available as employment , housing and education Latest vote colonies till they vote tomorrow .
not_available Can I get you something ?
not_available So you work here now ?
not_available Why should I ask the bartender to get me a drink ?
not_available What's in it for him ?
not_available on ?
not_available So , are you worried about Wallace Gray ?
not_available I hear he's ahead in the vote count .
not_available well .
not_available and my husband's place in the future .
not_available or is there hope of resuscitating it ?
not_available Gaius ?
not_available His wrists were slashed with broken glass from the room .
not_available Zarek had him killed .
not_available events .
not_available never shouldered any real responsibility in your life .
not_available To be fair to Tom , he's been in prison for the last 20 years .
not_available no nothing .
not_available What I have to say is , we must survive .
not_available through the values that have made our colonies great .
not_available to make tomorrow better .
not_available but for our children .
not_available What am I supposed to say ?
not_available I watched you working with Adar .
not_available so dignified .
not_available wrong .
not_available .
not_available I heard you on the wireless .
not_available for politics .
not_available A man who uses his intelligence and resources to blow up buildings doesn't get my vote , no .
not_available Now I'm going to give you an exclusive .
not_available Zarek's too smart to take another shot at the President during the summit .
not_available when everyone's forgotten about Valance .
not_available Well , let me know when it's one of those times .
not_available Gaius Baltar .
not_available to the scientific genius a man who is credited with saving the fleet on numerous occasions .
not_available Zarek .
not_available I give you your new vice I never aspired to power .
not_available Of course you didn't , Gaius .
not_available we're on a first name basis now .
not_available me .
not_available that bum knee of yours is looking pretty good .
not_available , if you want to ask me to dance , just ask .
not_available in a dress is a onceina opportunity .
not_available I won't be kissing you today .
not_available months .
not_available then .
not_available know .
not_available Valance .
not_available good evening .
not_available these things .
not_available I'm a patriot .
not_available the devil you know .
not_available you only get killed once .
not_available over .
not_available in a luxury suite aboard the Rising Star as something to be worried about .
not_available ?
not_available I have my ways .
not_available to give you the day off . .
not_available If anything happens You don't have to say anything .
not_available We're still alive .
not_available Helo .

president_laura_roslin I can assure you , the fuel shortage is our number one priority .
president_laura_roslin Galactica has ships scouring the nearby star systems and we can anticipate they will soon find tylium .
president_laura_roslin Hamilton .
Hamilton#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Madam President , tylium ore is extremely rare .
Hamilton#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 If we dont find any , how long before the fleet runs out of fuel ?
president_laura_roslin That all depends on how well we conserve .
playa_palacios Isnt it a fact , Madam President that we only have enough for two more jumps ?
president_laura_roslin Yes , that is correct .
playa_palacios Do we have a contingency plan if we run out of tylium ?
president_laura_roslin If-- if that were to happen , we would use our last fuel to jump to the nearest planetary system .
playa_palacios And pray were lucky enough to find a habitable planet .
playa_palacios hissing Madam President , without fuel to take even the most basic evasive maneuver--
president_laura_roslin No-- uh. .
playa_palacios Wouldnt we be like ducks in a Cylon shooting gallery ?
president_laura_roslin Yes , we would .
president_laura_roslin Im--
president_laura_roslin I
president_laura_roslin m sorry .
president_laura_roslin Uh , that is all for now .
crashdown Commencing sweep 87 of asteroid field .
lt_sharon_valerii Any luck ?
crashdown How many times you gonna ask me that , Boomer ?
lt_sharon_valerii Well , until you find some tylium ore .
lt_sharon_valerii Or dont you want to be a hero to Ensign Davis , hmm ?
lt_sharon_valerii Oh , you havent noticed how she always sits next to you in the mess ?
lt_sharon_valerii Hows it going , Crash ?
lt_sharon_valerii Oh , youre so cute .
crashdown Damn it , theres so much debris in this system
crashdown , the dradis is useless , this is gonna take 100 years .
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah , I heard about how you found water , how you saved the whole fleet ...
crashdown Come on !
crashdown Jackpot , Boomer !
crashdown That asteroid dead ahead is a mountain of tylium !
lt_sharon_valerii Holy !
crashdown Check it !
lt_sharon_valerii Ahh , thank the gods !
lt_sharon_valerii Were heroes !
lt_sharon_valerii Yea !
crashdown Were heroes ?
crashdown Never fails-- great , Boomer the second that I score , the bus driver jumps in and takes the credit .
lt_sharon_valerii Okay , so , whos the one that we suggested--
crashdown What , what ?
lt_sharon_valerii The Cylons .
lt_sharon_valerii The rocks crawling with them .
crashdown We are well and truly fraked .
crashdown The only tylium within 12 light-years and we gotta kiss it goodbye .
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah , along with our asses if we dont get out of here , fast .
colonel_saul_tigh It figures the Cylons would be sitting on the only source of fuel within our reach .
lt_felix_gaeta Yeah , still staking out every water hole in the desert .
colonel_saul_tigh Only this time its a lake with enough tylium to last us a couple years .
cpt_lee_adama This must be some kind of conveyor belt , to get the ore from the mine , here into this cracking plant here .
lt_felix_gaeta A refinery , this far from their homeworld ?
cpt_lee_adama Why not ?
cpt_lee_adama They need fuel as much as we do .
lt_felix_gaeta Now theyve got it .
colonel_saul_tigh And enough firepower to keep it .
cpt_lee_adama All right , so we forget this asteroid , find another source .
colonel_saul_tigh You can bet your ass
colonel_saul_tigh the Cylons will be guarding that one too .
colonel_saul_tigh So we send the raptors out farther , 10 , 15 jumps .
colonel_saul_tigh Find a source they havent reached yet .
colonel_saul_tigh And use up all our fuel doing it .
colonel_saul_tigh How are we gonna get our refinery
colonel_saul_tigh ship--
admiral_william_adama We take the tylium from the Cylons .
colonel_saul_tigh With all respect , this is hardly the time to attack a superior force .
admiral_william_adama This is exactly the time .
admiral_william_adama We know where they are , they dont know where we are .
admiral_william_adama Catch them with their pants down .
cpt_lee_adama If we fail ?
colonel_saul_tigh End of game .
admiral_william_adama So we dont fail .
captain_kara_thrace When the missile gets close enough , youll be pulling maybe seven gs but to catch you , the bastards gonna have to pile on 40 to 60 .
captain_kara_thrace Its guidance system cant hack it , and itll miss ...
captain_kara_thrace most of the time .
chuckles Exactly how often is most of the time .
captain_kara_thrace It depends on your judgment and how well you pray .
captain_kara_thrace Attention on deck !
admiral_william_adama As you were .
admiral_william_adama Lt .
admiral_william_adama Thrace , can I have a word ?
captain_kara_thrace Of course .
captain_kara_thrace Take five , guys .
captain_kara_thrace Whats up ?
admiral_william_adama How they doing ?
captain_kara_thrace Wobbly as newborn colts
captain_kara_thrace but , uh , theyre getting stronger .
admiral_william_adama Thats good .
captain_kara_thrace Mm .
admiral_william_adama Got a job for you .
captain_kara_thrace Rumor mill has it that youre planning an op .
admiral_william_adama Rumor mills right , for a change .
admiral_william_adama Captain Adama and Col . Tigh are working up a plan now and I need some serious out-of-the-box thinking .
captain_kara_thrace Out of the box is where I live .
president_laura_roslin Ive been taking chamalla for a medical condition .
elosha So what have you seen ?
president_laura_roslin It started out as dreams of the Cylon that we had executed
president_laura_roslin but I had the dreams before we captured him .
president_laura_roslin The images were ...
elosha Prescient ?
president_laura_roslin Uncanny .
president_laura_roslin And now Im seeing things while Im awake .
elosha What kind of things ?
president_laura_roslin Snakes , there were snakes crawling all over my podium during the press conference .
elosha How many ?
president_laura_roslin About a dozen .
elosha Youre kidding me , right ?
elosha You read Pythia and now youre having me on .
president_laura_roslin No .
president_laura_roslin Who is Pythia ?
elosha One of the oracles , in the sacred scrolls .
elosha 3,600 years ago , Pythia wrote about the exile and the rebirth of a human race .
elosha And the lords anointed a leader to guide the caravan of the heavens to their new homeland and unto the leader they gave a vision of serpents , numbering two and ten , as a sign of things to come .
president_laura_roslin Pythia wrote that ?
elosha She also wrote that the leader suffered a wasting disease and would not live to enter the new land .
elosha But youre not dying ... are you ?
cpt_lee_adama And that will allow the attack force to wipe out these installations here .
cpt_lee_adama Now , if we do it right , there will not be any Cylon survivors .
cpt_lee_adama And the asteroid will be ours .
admiral_william_adama What do you think , Starbuck ?
captain_kara_thrace Its a textbook-perfect plan .
captain_kara_thrace Which is why it wont work .
colonel_saul_tigh Of course , we bow to your vast experience in strategic planning .
colonel_saul_tigh Refresh my memory
colonel_saul_tigh , what year was it that you graduated from war college ?
captain_kara_thrace Whats the matter , Colonel , married life
captain_kara_thrace not all you expected ?
admiral_william_adama Thats enough , both of you .
admiral_william_adama Were not gonna win this one by the book .
admiral_william_adama I let Starbuck in here because shes not weighed down by conventional thinking .
admiral_william_adama All due respect , gentlemen , were not as crazy as she is .
admiral_william_adama Okay , so what would you do differently ?
captain_kara_thrace To start , jumping Galactica in behind the planetoid to hide it from the Cylon base is an obvious move .
cpt_lee_adama You think theyll be covering their blind spot with recon patrols .
captain_kara_thrace I would , if I were them .
captain_kara_thrace What we need to do is make their patrols part of our plan .
captain_kara_thrace You know , make their tactics work for us .
captain_kara_thrace Heres what I would do ...
captain_kara_thrace At position code deacon , well need three civilian freighter ships to use as decoys .
president_laura_roslin Which means those passengers will have to relocated , to other ships that are already overcrowded .
admiral_william_adama Yes , if you approve .
captain_kara_thrace The decoy ships will jump into the enemy star system at extreme radar range from the Cylon asteroid .
captain_kara_thrace Galactica will jump here , close enough to launch its vipers at the base .
cpt_lee_adama As soon as the decoy freighters arrive in the system , theyll break wireless silence .
cpt_lee_adama Theyll be posing as a mine fleet coming after the tylium and pretend to be unaware of the Cylon presence .
captain_kara_thrace The Cylons will hear the messages and send a force of raiders after them .
captain_kara_thrace This will leave the base relatively undefended .
captain_kara_thrace Well have raptors prepositioned to keep an eye on the Cylons .
captain_kara_thrace When the Cylons move towards the decoys , Galacticas vipers will come in from behind and obliterate the base .
cpt_lee_adama Without the base theyll be unable to rearm , refuel ...
captain_kara_thrace Well mop them up and then well take the tylium .
president_laura_roslin What happens to the crews on the civilian decoy ships ?
cpt_lee_adama Theyll keep their F.T.L .
cpt_lee_adama Drives spooled up and just jump clear , first sign of trouble .
president_laura_roslin How many casualties do we anticipate ?
colonel_saul_tigh Itll cost us .
president_laura_roslin If you succeed , whats to prevent the Cylons from coming back with reinforcements ?
admiral_william_adama Nothing .
admiral_william_adama But if we get a chance to knock out that base , itll buy us some time .
president_laura_roslin Why ?
admiral_william_adama If you keep running from a schoolyard bully , he keeps on chasing you but the moment you turn around and stop
admiral_william_adama and you punch him really hard in a sensitive spot , hell think twice about coming back again .
president_laura_roslin So its either this or run out of fuel and be annihilated .
admiral_william_adama Sometimes you have to roll the hard six .
president_laura_roslin Well , the freighters are yours .
president_laura_roslin Good hunting , everyone .
admiral_william_adama Operation starts in 48 hours .
colonel_saul_tigh This is our target .
dr_gaius_baltar Cylon base .
colonel_saul_tigh Youre the Cylon expert .
colonel_saul_tigh We need to destroy their military facilities .
dr_gaius_baltar Without harming the tylium ore under the surface .
colonel_saul_tigh Exactly .
captain_kara_thrace A nuke would destroy the Cylons .
dr_gaius_baltar But the radiation would render the ore inert .
dr_gaius_baltar Unusable .
dr_gaius_baltar I see your dilemma .
dr_gaius_baltar Well , youre in luck , you know .
dr_gaius_baltar Refined tylium contains tremendous enthalpy to the order of half a billion megajoules per kilo .
dr_gaius_baltar If subjected to the right heat and compression , say , from a conventional warhead , you should get a suitably devastating explosion without the radioactive fallout .
dr_gaius_baltar All we have to do is hit the right spot .
dr_gaius_baltar Specifically , you need to hit the staging tanks for the refined tylium precursor .
dr_gaius_baltar Its a lot more unstable than the fuel itself .
captain_kara_thrace And where would they be ?
dr_gaius_baltar I need your advice on this one .
number_six Im flattered , Gaius , but I dont know the first thing about tylium refineries .
dr_gaius_baltar Neither do I. Oh , come on , you must have an inkling where I should tell them to bomb .
number_six No , but god does .
dr_gaius_baltar Oh , good .
dr_gaius_baltar I suppose god doesnt want me to destroy the base , because ... hes the Cylon god , right ?
number_six God doesnt take sides .
number_six He only wants your love .
number_six Open your heart to him and hell show you the way .
dr_gaius_baltar Be a lot simpler if you came out and told me .
number_six You must remember to surrender your ego .
number_six Remain humble .
dr_gaius_baltar If you ask me , god could do with cleaning his ears out .
dr_gaius_baltar Then he might hear what I have to say .
number_six Relax your neck .
dr_gaius_baltar Why , what are you gonna do ?
number_six I said relax .
dr_gaius_baltar All right , but please dont--
captain_kara_thrace Where would the staging tanks be , doctor ?
dr_gaius_baltar Uh ... uh
dr_gaius_baltar ... there , right there .
dr_gaius_baltar Hit any one of them and the place will go up like a three-kiloton bomb .
number_six Well done .
number_six So forceful , so decisive ... delivered with such elan .
dr_gaius_baltar He didnt speak to me .
dr_gaius_baltar God didnt speak to me .
dr_gaius_baltar So I was totally lying .
dr_gaius_baltar I just picked that spot at random .
number_six He doesnt always speak in words , Gaius .
dr_gaius_baltar So the fate of the entire human race depends upon my wild guess .
Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Attention on deck !
admiral_william_adama As you were .
admiral_william_adama Hows the knee , Starbuck ?
captain_kara_thrace Itll be ready .
captain_kara_thrace Im not missing this party .
admiral_william_adama Apollos leading the strike force , youre gonna have to sit this one out .
captain_kara_thrace Im the best pilot that you have .
admiral_william_adama Not right now .
admiral_william_adama Combat , you gotta pull six , seven gS .
admiral_william_adama Doc says your knee wont take it .
captain_kara_thrace Well , then hes wrong .
admiral_william_adama Is he ?
admiral_william_adama A viper thruster pedal ... requires this much force ... to activate .
admiral_william_adama Now youre on your attack run .
admiral_william_adama You launch your missiles .
admiral_william_adama So you gotta jam that pedal ... into the firewall and hold a six g turn ...
admiral_william_adama for ten seconds or you die .
admiral_william_adama Ten , nine , eight , seven , six five ,
admiral_william_adama four--
admiral_william_adama This was only three gs , Starbuck , not six .
admiral_william_adama Im sorry , its a tough one
admiral_william_adama but youre staying home .
captain_kara_thrace Keep your ingress low and fast .
captain_kara_thrace Use the terrain to stay hidden til the last second .
captain_kara_thrace Make sure you give the flak suppression unit enough time so that they can weaken defenses .
cpt_lee_adama You dont think Im up to this .
captain_kara_thrace Of course I do , youll be fine .
cpt_lee_adama Look , youre worried that Im not gonna pull it out of the fire with some high-risk retina-detaching move , the way Starbuck would .
cpt_lee_adama Well , Kara , Im sorry youre not suiting up .
cpt_lee_adama Because , believe me , everyone will feel so much better , me included , if you were riding along with us .
cpt_lee_adama But this isnt an ego trip , this is my job .
cpt_lee_adama And dont think for one moment that I will not get it done .
captain_kara_thrace I hope so , cause weve got one shot .
captain_kara_thrace Dont frak it up by overthinking .
captain_karl_agathon Nice thing about being on the run after a nuclear war
captain_karl_agathon , nobody left to complain if we hide out in their barn or raid their pantry while youre on your way to steal a ship and get off the planet .
captain_karl_agathon Its odd , isnt it ?
lt_sharon_valerii What ?
captain_karl_agathon That we havent seen a single living human being since the one you shot , when you rescued me .
captain_karl_agathon I mean , were still alive , why nobody else ?
lt_sharon_valerii Probably holed up in their fallout shelters or something .
captain_karl_agathon Two ways out , and a lovely view .
captain_karl_agathon What could be better ?
lt_sharon_valerii A feather bed and a silk comforter ?
captain_karl_agathon You hungry ?
captain_karl_agathon I dont know , what do we got ?
captain_karl_agathon Peanut butter ...
captain_karl_agathon baked beans , corn .
captain_karl_agathon How about some chili ?
captain_karl_agathon A simple no would do .
captain_karl_agathon Sharon , have you been taking your anti-radiation meds ?
lt_sharon_valerii Think it was those cold beans we had this afternoon .
captain_karl_agathon You okay now ?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah .
captain_karl_agathon How far you figure to Delphi ?
lt_sharon_valerii Eight , maybe ten days if we move fast .
lt_sharon_valerii If we start early , we can be there in no time .
admiral_william_adama Cant sleep ?
admiral_william_adama I couldnt either before a big op .
admiral_william_adama Mark two ... good ship .
admiral_william_adama Got me out of a lot of tough scrapes .
admiral_william_adama Got something for you .
admiral_william_adama Belonged to your grandfather .
admiral_william_adama My mom bought it for him when he was in law school .
admiral_william_adama See the engraving on it ?
cpt_lee_adama Yeah , I can barely make it out , but ...
admiral_william_adama He was a better father than I was .
admiral_william_adama Dad used to carry that into court cases , claimed he never lost , unless he left it behind .
cpt_lee_adama So youre worried too .
admiral_william_adama About what ?
cpt_lee_adama You know , sometimes it feels like the whole ship thinks , uh , Starbuck would do better .
admiral_william_adama I dont .
cpt_lee_adama How can you be so sure ?
admiral_william_adama Cause youre my son .
admiral_william_adama Get some rest , youre gonna need it .
cpt_lee_adama Dad ...
cpt_lee_adama Ill bring it back .
admiral_william_adama You better , or Ill kick your ass .
admiral_william_adama Its a good lighter .
captain_karl_agathon Sharon-- Sharon , wake up .
captain_karl_agathon What the frak ?
captain_karl_agathon You killed her !
lt_sharon_valerii Let me see .
lt_sharon_valerii We gotta go , right now .
captain_karl_agathon Wait a minute , I saw her on my lap , I saw her blood spill on my lap .
lt_sharon_valerii Lets move , mister .
captain_karl_agathon What the hell is going on ?
lt_sharon_valerii I dont know ,
lt_sharon_valerii well figure it out later .
lt_felix_gaeta Jump complete , sir .
lt_felix_gaeta Dradis reports nothing but hash , just as we expected .
lt_felix_gaeta Cant see a thing .

president_laura_roslin And when they do ?
admiral_william_adama If they take the bait , all hell breaks loose .
president_laura_roslin Until then ?
admiral_william_adama We wait .
lt_sharon_valerii Galactica , Boomer .
lt_sharon_valerii Tally , 90+ headed deacon , speed : 250 .
lt_sharon_valerii The Cylons have seen the freighter .
lt_sharon_valerii Theyre en route to intercept .
admiral_william_adama They took the bait .
admiral_william_adama Mr .
admiral_william_adama Gaeta , launch strike force one .
admiral_william_adama Aye , sir .
admiral_william_adama D , launch strike force one .
officer_anastasia_dualla Attention :

captain_kara_thrace How hard did they bite ?
admiral_william_adama Boomers report said 90
admiral_william_adama + .
admiral_william_adama Theyve launched most of their fighter force .
Launch_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Give them hell , sir .
Launch_Officer#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Firing ...
lt_felix_gaeta Our attack force is away .
captain_kara_thrace I just hope that Lee can ...
admiral_william_adama Lee isnt the problem .
admiral_william_adama You should take a good look at yourself .
admiral_william_adama I had to go through the same transition .
admiral_william_adama When youre in the cockpit , youre in control .
admiral_william_adama Its hard to give it up .
captain_kara_thrace It would just be a lot easier if I was flying with them .
admiral_william_adama All you can do now is wait and hope you didnt make any mistakes .
captain_kara_thrace I never wanted this kind of responsibility .
admiral_william_adama The Cylons never asked us what we wanted .
admiral_william_adama Welcome to the big leagues .
crashdown Galactica , Crashdown , tally 50+ on an intercept course .
crashdown Repeat , 50+ inbound .
dr_gaius_baltar Whats that mean ?
captain_kara_thrace It means that a Cylon patrol spotted our attack force .
captain_kara_thrace The base sent out 50 more raiders , to intercept .
dr_gaius_baltar 50 raiders ?
dr_gaius_baltar That means were outnumbered now , 5:1 ?
president_laura_roslin Werent the decoys supposed to take care of that ?
admiral_william_adama Cylons are too smart for that .
captain_kara_thrace Frak .

Stubbs#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Cylon strike force is turning away from beacon and inbound to Galactica .
president_laura_roslin Cylons heard our transmission recall , didnt they ?
dr_gaius_baltar Does that mean the first wave of raiders is ignoring the decoys and is ... is coming after us ?
admiral_william_adama Thats exactly what it means .
dr_gaius_baltar So when are we going to launch the reserve vipers to defend Galactica ?
admiral_william_adama There are no reserve vipers .
admiral_william_adama Everything is on the board already .
admiral_william_adama Now we play for all the marbles .
admiral_william_adama Starbuck , its your plan .
captain_kara_thrace Mr .
captain_kara_thrace Gaeta , will you please tell D to get on the scrambler and inform Apollo
captain_kara_thrace the back door is open ?

Rolsin#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Thrace , why didnt you tell me we had another attack force hidden in the freighters ?
captain_kara_thrace We , uh--
admiral_william_adama It was my decision .
admiral_william_adama I routinely restrict tactical details to those who need to know .
admiral_william_adama Old habits die hard .
president_laura_roslin So you still might pull this off .
admiral_william_adama If Dr . Baltars target information is correct .
captain_kara_thrace And whether we get blown to pieces by those Cylon raiders heading toward us right now .
admiral_william_adama Speaking of which , Im needed in C-I-C .
cpt_lee_adama Initial point in five seconds .
cpt_lee_adama Flak suppression unit cleared hot .
cpt_lee_adama Okay , lets do this .

captain_kara_thrace Come on !
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Theyre jamming the guidance systems .
cpt_lee_adama Strike-two , Apollo , then we get close enough that we dont need the guidance systems .
cpt_lee_adama We have to blow this thing manually .
chuckles Wilco , Apollo , rolling in .
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 Chuckles ... chuckles !
chuckles Oh , frak ...
Racetrack#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode10 chuckles bought it , hes going down--
louanne_katraine Now theyve got our attack axis zeroed in .
louanne_katraine Theres no way to fraking get close .
captain_kara_thrace Frak ... theres gotta be .
cpt_lee_adama Weve gotta get out of this flak .
cpt_lee_adama Lets get down below the deck , down where the target is .
cpt_lee_adama Ive got an idea .
cpt_lee_adama Im gonna take a closer look .
officer_anastasia_dualla Commander on deck !
admiral_william_adama As you were .
colonel_saul_tigh First wave of Cylons will be on us in three minutes .
admiral_william_adama Notify the strike-one vipers that they can stop running and blast those bastards to hell .

lt_felix_gaeta Captain Apollos flying into the conveyor tunnel , hoping itll lead him to the refinery .

dr_gaius_baltar Theres no way to ensure it does anything of the kind .
cpt_lee_adama Come on , keep it together , Lee , keep it together , keep it-- oh , lords .
cpt_lee_adama Okay , Im through the tunnel .
cpt_lee_adama They cant get firing solution on me .

cpt_lee_adama You can tell Dr .
cpt_lee_adama Baltar he was right on the money .
cpt_lee_adama Its one hell of a fireworks show .
cpt_lee_adama And theres plenty of ore for us back in the canyon , once this place is history .
lt_felix_gaeta Congratulations , Doctor , it worked !

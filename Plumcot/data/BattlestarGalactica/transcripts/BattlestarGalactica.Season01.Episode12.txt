dr_gaius_baltar Some level of decorum has to be maintained , after all or is it a pirate ship youre running ?
captain_kara_thrace No , just a Battlestar , sir .
lt_felix_gaeta Right , lets play .
dr_gaius_baltar Would you like to play ?
dr_gaius_baltar Maybe youd like to sit next to Captain Adama .
cpt_lee_adama Sure , Kara , why dont you pull up a pew ?
captain_kara_thrace No , its okay , Lee , I got things to do .
president_laura_roslin All right , currency .
president_laura_roslin While bartering will continue for the foreseeable future , we do have a system in place now to take the economy back to a currency-based standard .
number_six Do you love her ?
dr_gaius_baltar Did you , um ...
president_laura_roslin Dr .
president_laura_roslin Baltar ... if something should happen to me , it is vital that you comprehend and are familiar with the political structures that are just beginning to fall into place here .
president_laura_roslin Do you understand this ?
number_six Answer me !
dr_gaius_baltar Yes , of course , I understand .
dr_gaius_baltar My answer is no .
dr_gaius_baltar No , I dont think that I can handle this right now the-- the intricacies of the bureaucracy
dr_gaius_baltar , I cant get my head around , uh , this , which , with all due respect , Madam President you have spent your entire political career uh , learning to understand .
dr_gaius_baltar More to the point , how you could think that my head could be turned so quickly by-- by a new thing is , uh , it just--
dr_gaius_baltar it astounds me .
dr_gaius_baltar How did you--
dr_gaius_baltar how did you seriously think that I was gonna be able to cope with this kind of responsibility ?
number_six I dont believe you .
president_laura_roslin Youre a genius , are you not ?
dr_gaius_baltar Well , quite frankly , I dont give a flying frak
dr_gaius_baltar whether you believe me or not , all right ?
dr_gaius_baltar Because Ive had it , I am ...
dr_gaius_baltar Im tired of being pushed and prodded around
dr_gaius_baltar like Im some kind of toy .
dr_gaius_baltar Im not your plaything !
#6_and_Roslin#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 Plaything ?
dr_gaius_baltar I dont work for you and uh , quite frankly , I dont have to sit any more and take this kind of abuse from either of you !
dr_gaius_baltar You either-- either in here , either in there
dr_gaius_baltar , wherever it is , I dont need to take it .
number_six I love you , Gaius .
dr_gaius_baltar Oh , do me a favor ...
president_laura_roslin I think perhaps , you need a break from this .
dr_gaius_baltar Youre right .
dr_gaius_baltar We need a break .
dr_gaius_baltar Id like to be alone , if you dont mind .
dr_gaius_baltar Ahhh !
number_six How can you love her , Gaius ?
number_six I dont !
number_six You cant lie to me , I know everything you know .
dr_gaius_baltar Oh , thats lovely .
dr_gaius_baltar Oh , thank you .
dr_gaius_baltar Did you , uh ... did you want something in particular this time ?
number_six I thought you should know that its not safe to remain on Galactica .
dr_gaius_baltar What are you talking about ?
number_six Its a surprise .
dr_gaius_baltar Tell me , what is it ?
dr_gaius_baltar What is it? !
dr_gaius_baltar Is it a bomb , another cylon bomb , right ?
dr_gaius_baltar Is it an agent ?
dr_gaius_baltar Is a cylon agent about to be activated ?
dr_gaius_baltar Tell me !
lt_sharon_valerii Galactica , this is raptor one , preparing to jump to sector 728 .
lt_sharon_valerii Lets hope we find some supplies out there .
lt_felix_gaeta Roger that , good hunting out there .
lt_sharon_valerii Crash , count our spinner .
crashdown F.T.L .
crashdown Drive spun up and ready ... jumping .
crashdown Five , four , three , two , one .
crashdown Whoa , baby !
lt_sharon_valerii Frak me !
lt_sharon_valerii Gaeta , that fraking idiot .
lt_sharon_valerii She pilots the raptor out of danger
lt_sharon_valerii You cant plan a jump that close to a planet what if we jumped into the damn thing ?
crashdown Oh , that was great , its fine , we made it , were cool .
crashdown Are you seeing this ?
lt_sharon_valerii Yeah .
crashdown Oceans ... continents .
crashdown Let me at this thing .
crashdown Okay , atmosphere reads as ...
crashdown nitrogen/oxygen .
crashdown Looks like enough CO2 for green leafy things , too ,
crashdown Im starting to get excited here , Boomer .
crashdown Boomer , this could it , this could be the big one this is the little planet that solves all of our problems .
crashdown Boomer ... do you think this is Earth ?
lt_sharon_valerii No , its not Earth .
lt_sharon_valerii Its more important than that .
lt_sharon_valerii Doesnt really work as well as before , huh ?
lt_sharon_valerii You know , I do get cold .
lt_sharon_valerii There are some things you should know , Helo .
captain_karl_agathon Dont call me that .
captain_karl_agathon Youre not even Sharon , youre not even human .
captain_karl_agathon So dont start acting like you know me , because you dont !
lt_sharon_valerii But I am Sharon and thats part of what you need to understand .
captain_karl_agathon Sharon was a friend of mine .
captain_karl_agathon Whatever twisted thing you are , you are not Sharon , you got that ?
captain_karl_agathon The only thing I want from you is a way off this fraked-up world , thats it !
cpt_lee_adama Going hunting ?
captain_kara_thrace Im adding a gunnery run to the jump test tomorrow , see if our boy here can shoot anything with our ammo .
cpt_lee_adama So its a boy now .
captain_kara_thrace Changed my mind .
cpt_lee_adama You ever wonder why everyone calls it a she but to you its a he ?
captain_kara_thrace Its fascinating , Lee , you should write a paper .
cpt_lee_adama Well , its not really my scene .
cpt_lee_adama Im not as smart as , say , um , Dr .
cpt_lee_adama Baltar .
cpt_lee_adama How is the Vice President , by the way ?
captain_kara_thrace I dont know , havent seen him .
cpt_lee_adama So hes a love em and leave em kinda guy , I guess .
captain_kara_thrace I guess .
cpt_lee_adama Ships that just pass in the night .
captain_kara_thrace Yup .
cpt_lee_adama Didnt mean a thing ?
captain_kara_thrace Nope .
cpt_lee_adama Just bored , something to do .
cpt_lee_adama So fraking the vice President of the colonies just seemed like a great way to waste some time .
captain_kara_thrace You want something from me ?
cpt_lee_adama Not a thing .
captain_kara_thrace Cause I dont owe you anything .
cpt_lee_adama No , you dont owe me anything cause Im just a C.A.G .
cpt_lee_adama And youre just a pilot .
captain_kara_thrace Right .
cpt_lee_adama Pilot who cant keep her pants on .
captain_kara_thrace Right .
cpt_lee_adama Oh , it is just like old times , Kara .
cpt_lee_adama Like when you got drunk and you couldnt keep your hands off that major from wherever--
cpt_lee_adama Whyd you do it , Kara ?
cpt_lee_adama Just tell me why .
captain_kara_thrace Cause Im a screw-up , Lee , try and keep that in mind .
billy_keikeya So commander Adama is sending out another raptor to conduct an aerial survey of this planet .
billy_keikeya Uh , it appears to have suffered some sort of a calamity , but it could actually be inhabitable .
billy_keikeya The aerial survey shows evidence of at least one city on the surface .
billy_keikeya It was obviously abandoned a long time ago .
president_laura_roslin How old are the ruins ?
billy_keikeya Uh , well , we wont know for sure until they send a ground team but the initial estimates have it , uh , on the order of approximately 2,000 years .
elosha Thats around the time the 13 tribes first left Kobol .
president_laura_roslin Let me see .
president_laura_roslin Ruins , what ruins ?
president_laura_roslin This is an inhabited city .
president_laura_roslin Look at the buildings .
elosha Buildings ?
president_laura_roslin Look ...
elosha What did you see ?
elosha Tell me , Laura .
president_laura_roslin A dome-like structure with six roads leading out of it , like spokes .
president_laura_roslin With something around it like columns , like a forum like the forum on Caprica , actually .
elosha The forum and the opera house in the city of the gods .
elosha on Kobol .
elosha This planet is Kobol .
billy_keikeya Kobol , like ... Kobol ?
elosha Birthplace of mankind .
elosha Where the gods and men lived in paradise until the exodus of the 13 tribes .
billy_keikeya Madam President , whats going on ?
president_laura_roslin Its real .
president_laura_roslin The scriptures , the myths , the prophecies , theyre all real .
elosha So say we all .
dr_gaius_baltar Hello , lieutenant ?
lt_sharon_valerii Hey , doc .
dr_gaius_baltar This is a bad time , right ?
lt_sharon_valerii No , uh , Im just cleaning my gun .
lt_sharon_valerii Whats going on ?
dr_gaius_baltar Well , I was gonna ask you the same question .
dr_gaius_baltar Actually , I was looking for Lt . Thrace
dr_gaius_baltar but , uh ... sometimes its good to talk these things over .
number_six Deep down she knows shes a cylon .
number_six But her conscious mind wont accept it .
lt_sharon_valerii Sometimes I have these dark thoughts .
dr_gaius_baltar What kind of dark thoughts ?
number_six Her model is weak .
number_six Always has been .
number_six But , in the end , shell carry out her mission .
dr_gaius_baltar I dont know .
dr_gaius_baltar But Im afraid
dr_gaius_baltar Im gonna hurt someone .
dr_gaius_baltar Feel like I have to be stopped .
number_six She cant be stopped , shes a cylon .
number_six You cant help her , Gaius .
number_six But you could probably sleep with her .
number_six Thats what you want , right ?
dr_gaius_baltar Im
dr_gaius_baltar not sure what-- sometimes , uh , we must embrace that which opens up for us .
lt_sharon_valerii Embrace ?
dr_gaius_baltar Life can be a curse , as well as a blessing .
dr_gaius_baltar You will believe me when I tell you , there are far worse things than death , in this world .
lt_sharon_valerii So youre saying--
dr_gaius_baltar No , no , no , uh ... what I say is meaningless .
dr_gaius_baltar Listen to your heart .
dr_gaius_baltar Embrace that which you know to be the right decision .
admiral_william_adama You might be right , this may be Kobol .
admiral_william_adama I think we should seriously consider permanent settlement on this planet .
president_laura_roslin The scriptures tell us that Kobol points the way to Earth .
admiral_william_adama Organize a ground survey team , three raptors .
admiral_william_adama I want a complete survey of the ruins immediately .
cpt_lee_adama Yes , sir .
number_six You should go .
number_six Remember what I said , Gaius .
number_six You dont wanna be here when it happens .
dr_gaius_baltar When what happens-- what would happen if I go ?
dr_gaius_baltar Uh , in fact , I think Im going to volunteer for the survey party .
admiral_william_adama Your presence wont be necessary , Doctor , thank you .
dr_gaius_baltar I am the vice President of the colonies , elected in my own right
dr_gaius_baltar and I feel that my presence on the planet will be necessary , Commander .
dr_gaius_baltar As your chief science advisor , Im expected to analyze all of the samples the team bring back and quite frankly , itll be far more efficient if I can gather the samples by myself .
dr_gaius_baltar Unless you have any objection , Madam President .
president_laura_roslin No objections , thank you .
president_laura_roslin We need to talk .
admiral_william_adama Sure .
chief_galen_tyrol You
chief_galen_tyrol okay ?
lt_sharon_valerii What do you think ?
chief_galen_tyrol I think its hard to imagine that you forgot to check the chamber .
lt_sharon_valerii I didnt forget .
chief_galen_tyrol Sharon ...
chief_galen_tyrol whats going on ?
chief_galen_tyrol I know things havent been so great lately but--
lt_sharon_valerii I wake up in the morning
lt_sharon_valerii and I wonder who I am .
lt_sharon_valerii I wake up and wonder if Im gonna hurt someone .
chief_galen_tyrol Sharon , you need help .
lt_sharon_valerii Not from you , you made that clear .
lt_sharon_valerii Im on my own .
chief_galen_tyrol No , youre not .
lt_sharon_valerii Thanks for coming out , Chief .
lt_sharon_valerii Youre dismissed .
president_laura_roslin So , according to the scriptures , if we had the Arrow of Apollo we could take it down to Kobol and we could use it to open the tomb of Athena and find our way to Earth .
admiral_william_adama I didnt know you were that religious .
president_laura_roslin Neither did I. Something wrong with that ?
admiral_william_adama No .
admiral_william_adama Its just new .
admiral_william_adama There is no Earth , you understand that .
president_laura_roslin It would seem that we were wrong .
president_laura_roslin Commander , just because you and I dont know where it is doesnt mean it doesnt exist .
admiral_william_adama Madam President , Im not trying to mock your faith , so please understand me .
admiral_william_adama These stories about Kobol , gods , the Arrow of Apollo ...
admiral_william_adama theyre just stories , legends , myths .
admiral_william_adama Dont let it blind you to the reality that we face .
president_laura_roslin Reality is that the cylon raider has been successfully jump-tested .
president_laura_roslin Reality is that cylon technology obviously outstrips our own , and reality is , there is a good chance the raider can jump all the way back to Caprica and retrieve that arrow and find our way to Earth , the real Earth .
admiral_william_adama The raiders a military asset .
admiral_william_adama Im not gonna use it to go chasing some mythical arrow .
admiral_william_adama Im sorry .
Raptor_2_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 I say we find Kobol
Raptor_2_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 , we count our blessings and stay there .
Raptor_3_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 Yeah , but the sacred scrolls tell us that this could guide us to Earth , right , l-t ?
Raptor_1_pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 Okay ,
Raptor_1_pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 yeah ,
Raptor_1_pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 yeah ,
Raptor_1_pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 yeah , cut the chatter .

Raptor_3_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 What the hell is that ?
Raptor_3_Pilot#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode12 Oh , my gods !
crashdown Theyre everywhere--
chief_galen_tyrol Get us out of here !

chief_galen_tyrol Like , right now !
chief_galen_tyrol Get us out of here !
crewman_specialist_socinus Raptor two , Raptor two ...
crewman_specialist_socinus you are ordered to jump back to Galactica , over .
crewman_specialist_socinus You are ordered to jump back to Galactica !
lt_felix_gaeta Whenever theyre within a certain proximity to one another , they send off a short I.F.F .
lt_felix_gaeta Burst .
lt_felix_gaeta Essentially , theyre cylon transponders programmed to identify themselves as any other cylon transponder .
colonel_saul_tigh Damn nice work , lieutenant .
admiral_william_adama Thats very good .
admiral_william_adama Now that we know what they are , I wanna test one in the raider .
officer_anastasia_dualla Dradis contact , Raptor 275 , sir .
colonel_saul_tigh Back early .
admiral_william_adama Somethings wrong .
chief_galen_tyrol What the hell are you doing? !
dr_gaius_baltar Oh , god !

crashdown Wooooo!! !
president_laura_roslin How many did we lose ?
cpt_lee_adama Ten souls aboard aptor three .
cpt_lee_adama Raptor one , last visual contact was seen under powered flight , heading toward the surface .
cpt_lee_adama We need a way to take out the baseship before we can attempt a rescue .
colonel_saul_tigh Starbucks already working on a plan using the captured raider to get a nuke into the baseship .
president_laura_roslin The raider ?
cpt_lee_adama When-- when did this happen ?
colonel_saul_tigh About ten minutes ago .
colonel_saul_tigh She said shes working on the details and will have a report at 14:00 .
admiral_william_adama Go talk to Starbuck right away .
cpt_lee_adama My pleasure .
admiral_william_adama And report back to me .
cpt_lee_adama Yes , sir .
billy_keikeya Is there something I should be worried about , Madam President ?
president_laura_roslin Why do you ask that ?
billy_keikeya That look on your face .
president_laura_roslin Not now .
captain_kara_thrace Hey , guys , take that out .
captain_kara_thrace I know the chief said we need it
captain_kara_thrace but I dont need it--
cpt_lee_adama Lt .
cpt_lee_adama Thrace , atten-tion .
cpt_lee_adama Lt .
cpt_lee_adama Thrace , I gave you a command you will obey it .
cpt_lee_adama Atten ... tion !
cpt_lee_adama You do not take your harebrained ideas to the X.O .
cpt_lee_adama Without going through me first , do you understand ?
captain_kara_thrace Yes , sir .
cpt_lee_adama At ease , so whats the plan ?
captain_kara_thrace Im putting an autopilot in the raider .
captain_kara_thrace Jump him to the baseship , engage the autopilot , punch out get picked up by a raptor .
captain_kara_thrace The raider heads to the baseship .
captain_kara_thrace Picks up the transponder , allows the raider to approach , nuke goes off .
captain_kara_thrace Boom , sir .
cpt_lee_adama Might work .
cpt_lee_adama Might get you killed .
captain_kara_thrace Would you miss me , sir ?
cpt_lee_adama I need every pilot I have .
cpt_lee_adama Even the screw-ups .
captain_kara_thrace Captain ...
captain_kara_thrace Im really sorry .
billy_keikeya If you do this , it could threaten everything that weve accomplished .
billy_keikeya It will probably bring down the government and you dont have a right to risk that for a ...
president_laura_roslin Go on .
billy_keikeya For a drug-induced vision of prophecy .
president_laura_roslin I am well aware of that .
president_laura_roslin But it would seem that the gods have a different plan .
president_laura_roslin Would you please get me Lt .
president_laura_roslin Thrace ?
billy_keikeya Can I get you some more water ?
president_laura_roslin Yes , thanks .
captain_kara_thrace You cant be serious .
president_laura_roslin All of this has happened before and all of this will happen again .
president_laura_roslin The cylon you interrogated , he quoted that bit of scripture .
president_laura_roslin He also said that we would find Kobol and Kobol would show us the way , did he not ?
captain_kara_thrace Yes , he did .
president_laura_roslin Well , we have found Kobol .
president_laura_roslin Do you believe in the gods , Lieutenant ?
captain_kara_thrace Not that its any of your business , but , yes , I believe .
president_laura_roslin Lieutenant , Im not trying to put you on the defensive , I
president_laura_roslin just-- I would like you to think this through with me .
president_laura_roslin If you believe in the gods , then you believe in the cycle of time , that we are all playing our parts in a story that is told again , and again , and again , throughout eternity .
captain_kara_thrace Thats the way I was raised .
captain_kara_thrace But that doesnt mean that my part in the story is to go off on some crazy-ass mission against orders .
president_laura_roslin May I tell you the part of the story that it would seem , I am playing ?
president_laura_roslin I am dying .
captain_kara_thrace What ?
president_laura_roslin I have terminal breast cancer .
president_laura_roslin I have six months at the outside to live
president_laura_roslin and Ive only told three people so I would appreciate it if you kept it to yourself .
captain_kara_thrace Of course .
captain_kara_thrace Are you saying that youre--
president_laura_roslin The scriptures tell us that a dying leader led humanity to the promised land .
president_laura_roslin If you go back to Caprica and bring me the arrow , I will show us the way .
captain_kara_thrace This is crazy .
president_laura_roslin You keep using that word .
president_laura_roslin It is crazy , perhaps .
president_laura_roslin But it doesnt mean it isnt true .
president_laura_roslin And it may be our only chance , our only chance to find Earth .
captain_kara_thrace The old man is our last chance to find Earth .
captain_kara_thrace He knows where it is , he said so , you were there .
captain_kara_thrace The location is a secret but he is going to take us there .
president_laura_roslin Commander Adama has no idea where Earth is .
president_laura_roslin He never did , he made it up in order to give people hope .
captain_kara_thrace Youre lying .
president_laura_roslin Go ask him .
captain_kara_thrace I will .
captain_kara_thrace Im gonna need one more in-flight test for the autopilot and nav systems before we jump for Kobol .
admiral_william_adama Right .
captain_kara_thrace Can I ask you a question , boss ?
admiral_william_adama Shoot .
captain_kara_thrace How much longer til we reach Earth ?
admiral_william_adama Its hard to say .
captain_kara_thrace You got a guess ?
admiral_william_adama You know I dont like to guess .
captain_kara_thrace We getting closer ?
admiral_william_adama Im sure we are .
admiral_william_adama Good luck on the next test .
captain_kara_thrace Apollo/Starbuck
captain_kara_thrace , Im ready over here .
cpt_lee_adama Okay , Starbuck , the board is green .
captain_kara_thrace Copy that .
captain_kara_thrace Powering up for the autopilot test .
captain_kara_thrace This is Starbuck , request permission to speak with Galactica actual .
officer_anastasia_dualla Starbuck wants to speak to you , sir .
officer_anastasia_dualla Shes--
officer_anastasia_dualla shes on a scrambled channel .
admiral_william_adama Go ahead .
captain_kara_thrace I believed you , believed in Earth .
admiral_william_adama What are you doing , starbuck ?
captain_kara_thrace Bringing home the cat , sir .
admiral_william_adama We can talk about this .
captain_kara_thrace No , I dont think so .
admiral_william_adama I want you to , remember one thing .
admiral_william_adama I do not regret anything that I did .
admiral_william_adama Be sure that whatever youre gonna do
admiral_william_adama , you dont regret it later , do you understand me ?

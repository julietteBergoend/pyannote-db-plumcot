colonel_saul_tigh And where are they gonna come from ?
president_laura_roslin Slave labor .
admiral_william_adama They are criminals and theyve been sentenced to hard labor , and this is very hard labor , not to mention physically dangerous .
admiral_william_adama This is not for civilians , but ...
cpt_lee_adama Their ship wasnt designed for long-term incarceration .
cpt_lee_adama These men have been stuck in cramped cells for weeks , now .
cpt_lee_adama They might even prefer to get out , do something , even if it is dangerous .
president_laura_roslin If they volunteer ; but these men are not slaves , and I will not have them treated as such .
cpt_lee_adama No ... we could offer incentives .
cpt_lee_adama Points towards earning freedom .
admiral_william_adama Excuse me ?
admiral_william_adama You wanna start releasing hardened criminals into the fleet ?
cpt_lee_adama Sir , these men were on their way to Caprica for parole hearings , which at least implies they may be ready for release .
president_laura_roslin Make it happen , Captain .
cpt_lee_adama Yes , sir .
president_laura_roslin Billy , to address Commander Adamas concerns , Id like you to go along and set up some sort of screening procedure to weed out the hardened criminals .

admiral_william_adama Ill make sure that all the men that are chosen know how to handle the equipment .

cpt_lee_adama I just thought maybe you had something you wanted to say .
admiral_william_adama I have nothing to say to the personal representative of the President .
cpt_lee_adama Im still Galacticas lead pilot .
admiral_william_adama Well , I have nothing to say to him either .
admiral_william_adama Every man has to decide for themselves which side theyre on .
cpt_lee_adama I didnt know we were pickin sides .
admiral_william_adama Thats why you havent picked one yet .
wilkens Im a bus driver , not a warden .

cpt_lee_adama Thousands of us are on the verge of dying from dehydration .
cpt_lee_adama Now , the good news is we have found water .
cpt_lee_adama The bad news is its located on a moon with harsh environmental conditions .
cpt_lee_adama We need 1,000 able-bodied men to help us get that water .
cpt_lee_adama President Roslin feels that you represent our best chance .
cpt_lee_adama She also recognizes that you are not slaves .
cpt_lee_adama Any man who volunteers to help us during this emergency will earn freedom points , which can be applied toward earning his release .
cpt_lee_adama Were offering you a chance for a new beginning .

aaron_doral True .
aaron_doral But parents have to die .
aaron_doral Its the only way children come into their own .
cpt_lee_adama No , thats not necessary .
cpt_lee_adama Id like to talk to you .

tom_zarek The book that had to be smuggled out of labor camp because stumps arent allowed freedom of expression ?
cpt_lee_adama I read it , in college .
cpt_lee_adama Thought it was radical , challenging .
cpt_lee_adama It made me question some things Id accepted before without thinking .
tom_zarek Nice to hear Im a big hit on campus .
cpt_lee_adama You arent , the book was banned .
cpt_lee_adama I read it , anyway .
cpt_lee_adama The point is : I understand where youre coming from , but I dont think you understand how critical the situation is out there .
cpt_lee_adama People are gonna start dying .
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Hey , Stark .
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Its time for your break .

billy_keikeya These people ...
billy_keikeya your people have been exploited !
officer_anastasia_dualla You cannot tell me about my people .
billy_keikeya Im not telling you about your people ... !
Man#unknown#BattlestarGalactica.Season01.Episode03 Excuse me .
cpt_lee_adama All I want , the President wants , is to offer you a chance to earn your freedom .
tom_zarek Now , youve said the truth : freedom is earned .

captain_kara_thrace Screaming at people doesnt always get the best results , sir .
captain_kara_thrace I learned that at officer candidate school .
colonel_saul_tigh You are right on the edge , Thrace .
colonel_saul_tigh Careful you dont fall off .
captain_kara_thrace Speaking of falling off ... glad to see you found a way to quench your thirst .
cpt_lee_adama They wont negotiate while youre holding hostages .

tom_zarek To be treated like men , not animals .
tom_zarek Finally have somethin to bargain with .
cpt_lee_adama So what happens now ?

cpt_lee_adama What about ?
tom_zarek Your father .
dr_gaius_baltar Is this a Montclair original ?
admiral_william_adama Yes .
dr_gaius_baltar Fantastic .
admiral_william_adama Would you like some water ?
dr_gaius_baltar Uh , yes , thank you .
dr_gaius_baltar Yeah , Im not a collector , myself , but I ...
dr_gaius_baltar I am familiar with his work .
dr_gaius_baltar And , may I say , you really do have an excellent eye for art .
admiral_william_adama Thank you .
admiral_william_adama Wheres my Cylon detector , doctor ?
dr_gaius_baltar Oh , that .
dr_gaius_baltar Yes , its taking longer than expected .
dr_gaius_baltar Unfortunately .
admiral_william_adama Whats the hangup ?
number_six Its not working this time , Gaius .
number_six He can see right through you .
dr_gaius_baltar Well , there are a number of obstacles , none of them insurmountable , of course , but they do tend to slow us down .
dr_gaius_baltar For a start , the , uh-
dr_gaius_baltar well , the lack of proper facilities .
dr_gaius_baltar The water shortage , of course , the water shortage , not to mention ...
admiral_william_adama Cut the BS .
admiral_william_adama You said you had a way of detecting human from Cylon .
admiral_william_adama Do you or dont you ?
dr_gaius_baltar I don't .
number_six What ?
dr_gaius_baltar I dont think that Im the man for this job .
dr_gaius_baltar Im not cut out for this kind of work .
number_six You have to do this .
dr_gaius_baltar Why do I keep putting it off ?
dr_gaius_baltar Its my subconscious .
dr_gaius_baltar Its my subconscious telling me-
dr_gaius_baltar telling me that Im not the man for this job , please .
number_six Listen to me .
number_six If you dont tell him what he wants to hear , hes going to find you out , and when he does , theyre going to tear your head off and throw your body out of an airlock !
dr_gaius_baltar Woo !
dr_gaius_baltar Pardon me .
dr_gaius_baltar I , uh-
dr_gaius_baltar I havent had much sleep recently ,
dr_gaius_baltar so ...
admiral_william_adama Unfortunately , doctor , for both of us , youre the last man we have .
admiral_william_adama So whats the game plan , Doc ?
number_six This is what you say : Commander , the truth is , there is one way .
number_six Say it !
dr_gaius_baltar Commander , the truth is ... there is one way .
number_six " I didnt want to have to ask you for this ... "
dr_gaius_baltar I didnt want to have to ask you for this ...
number_six " But what I really need ... "
dr_gaius_baltar But what I really need to complete the project ...
number_six " Is a nuclear warhead .
number_six "
dr_gaius_baltar Is a nuclear ... warhead .
tom_zarek That's how you got to be the personal representative of the President ?
tom_zarek Because of your father ?
cpt_lee_adama Hardly .
tom_zarek So they dont get along , Adama and Roslin .
cpt_lee_adama They have their differences , but not when it comes to dealing with terrorists .
tom_zarek I thought you said you respected me , read my book .
cpt_lee_adama That was before you resorted to violence and hostage-taking .
tom_zarek Its always better when the oppressed dont fight back , isnt it ?
admiral_william_adama A warhead .
number_six " Technically , I need the plutonium inside . "
dr_gaius_baltar Technically , I need the plutonium inside .
number_six Figure out the rest for yourself .
dr_gaius_baltar As you may know , the Cylons are susceptible to certain kinds of radiation .
dr_gaius_baltar And by taking the plutonium and ... embedding it in the carbon nanotube matrix ... and it really is that simple ...
dr_gaius_baltar I can construct a filter that will preferentially ionize synthetic molecules and , thus , deliver to you your Cylons .
admiral_william_adama We have five warheads left aboard this ship .
admiral_william_adama We may need them .
dr_gaius_baltar Well , yes , of course .
dr_gaius_baltar If you , uh , if you really think that this project has a low priority , then , you know , youre totally within your bounds to ...
admiral_william_adama Youll get your warhead .
number_six Good boy .
dr_gaius_baltar Thank you ... Commander .
chief_galen_tyrol Look , the Master-at-Arms has been over every inch of that locker .
chief_galen_tyrol Shes come up with nothing .
lt_sharon_valerii So theyve got no idea who took those six g-4 charges or who put that detonator in ...
chief_galen_tyrol Hey , hey , hey ... dont worry about it .
chief_galen_tyrol Ill take care of it , okay ?
colonel_saul_tigh Mmm ...
colonel_saul_tigh I need to speak with the lieutenant , alone .
colonel_saul_tigh You dont honestly think youve been fooling everyone , do you ?
colonel_saul_tigh I know , the old man knows , hell , the whole ship knows about you and the Chief .
colonel_saul_tigh It stops , now .
lt_sharon_valerii Sir , the chief and I are just friends ...
colonel_saul_tigh Back when the ship was being decommissioned , we let you two get away with it .
colonel_saul_tigh Hell , we let everyone get away with murder .
colonel_saul_tigh But that was then and this is now .
colonel_saul_tigh Were at war , this is a combat unit and youre his superior officer .
colonel_saul_tigh Put a stop to it , thats an order .
lt_sharon_valerii Yes , sir .
lt_felix_gaeta Attention , pass the word : Colonel <Tigh , Colonel <Tigh , please report to C.I.C .
tom_zarek The crew are my prisoners .
tom_zarek They will not be harmed .
admiral_william_adama Are you recording this ?
lt_felix_gaeta Yes , sir .
colonel_saul_tigh Whats this ?
admiral_william_adama Trouble .
tom_zarek But I have two conditions before I release my captives .
tom_zarek First , the government which controls our fate is illegal and illegitimate , and it must submit to the will of the people .
tom_zarek I demand the immediate resignation of Laura Roslin and her ministers .
tom_zarek Second , I demand free and open elections to choose a new leadership and a new government that represents all of the people .
tom_zarek These demands are made not for me or for the former slaves held on this ship , but for you , the people , the survivors of the holocaust and the children of humanitys future .
tom_zarek I am Tom Zarek , and this is the first day of the new era .
admiral_william_adama We've jammed his transmissions .
president_laura_roslin A little bit late for that , every ship in the fleet heard that broadcast .
admiral_william_adama It doesnt matter .
president_laura_roslin It does matter .
president_laura_roslin Hes trying to bring down the government .
admiral_william_adama No ones going to take it seriously .
president_laura_roslin You have something to learn when it comes to public opinion , Commander .
president_laura_roslin Tom Zarek is a name with weight , a very sympathetic figure , a legend , almost .
president_laura_roslin 20 years in prison , over a matter of principle .
admiral_william_adama Hes a criminal and a terrorist , people arent gonna give him credence .
president_laura_roslin Dont be so sure , Commander .
president_laura_roslin Rebellions are contagious .
president_laura_roslin People are already rioting over the water crisis .
president_laura_roslin We cant afford to destabilize this government right now .
admiral_william_adama I agree .
president_laura_roslin When are you going in ?
admiral_william_adama I assumed you were gonna talk to him first .
president_laura_roslin We dont negotiate with terrorists .
admiral_william_adama I said " talk " .
president_laura_roslin Theres nothing to talk about .
president_laura_roslin What he wants , I cant give him .
admiral_william_adama Were not ready yet .
admiral_william_adama Talking to Zarek give us a little more time .
president_laura_roslin Thats what he wants , he wants legitimacy .
president_laura_roslin He wants to be recognized .
president_laura_roslin He wants his crimes validated .
president_laura_roslin I watched
president_laura_roslin President Adar offer him a full pardon if hed apologize and give up violence as a means of political change .
president_laura_roslin He refused .
president_laura_roslin No commitments , no deals .
admiral_william_adama Ill let you know what happens .
captain_kara_thrace Three assault teams , Alpha , Bravo , Constellation .
captain_kara_thrace We jam their dradis , the Raptors cut through the hull here , here and here , without being seen .
captain_kara_thrace once were inside
captain_kara_thrace , Alpha takes-
colonel_saul_tigh Whats this we crap ?
captain_kara_thrace Im going , sir .
colonel_saul_tigh Like hell .
admiral_william_adama We have a few marines left on Galactica , let them handle it , Starbuck .
captain_kara_thrace They dont have a sniper .
captain_kara_thrace And , with all due respect , sir , I am the best shot in or out of the cockpit .
colonel_saul_tigh Shes right ... for once .
admiral_william_adama Wonders never cease .
admiral_william_adama All right , youre goin in .
admiral_william_adama You get a clear shot at Zarek , you take it .
admiral_william_adama And I want to control that ship immediately .
admiral_william_adama And I want all the hostages alive .
captain_kara_thrace Yes , sir .
officer_anastasia_dualla I dont even know how I drew this detail .
billy_keikeya President thought youd be valuable .
officer_anastasia_dualla The President doesnt know who I am .
billy_keikeya I told her .
billy_keikeya Sorry .
officer_anastasia_dualla on the other hand , its nice to get out of the C.I.C .
officer_anastasia_dualla Break up the day ... meet new people .
mason Youre not asleep .
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Not any more .
mason Is that your way of telling us youre not scared ?
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson No , its my way of telling you
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Im tired .
mason You dont know what tired is .
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Right .
mason Dont !
mason Dont mock me , little girl !
crewman_specialist_cally_henderson Im not mocking you .
mason Tom and I , we go way back , long time .
mason If you know whats good for you , youll be nice to me .
colonel_saul_tigh Frequent wireless contact .
colonel_saul_tigh Keep us informed all the way .
captain_kara_thrace Yes , sir .
colonel_saul_tigh Good hunting .
tom_zarek Who voted for Laura Roslin ?
tom_zarek You ?
tom_zarek Did you vote for her ?
cpt_lee_adama She was sworn in under the law ...
tom_zarek The answer is : no one voted for her .
tom_zarek No one !
tom_zarek And yet shes making decisions for all of us , deciding who lives and who dies .
tom_zarek Is that- is that democracy ?
tom_zarek Is that a free society ?
cpt_lee_adama What is it you want from me ?
cpt_lee_adama You want me to say she shouldnt be President ?
cpt_lee_adama We need a government .
cpt_lee_adama We need rules .
cpt_lee_adama We need a leader .
tom_zarek We need to be free men and women .
tom_zarek If were not free , then were no different than Cylons !
tom_zarek They call you Apollo .
cpt_lee_adama Its my call sign .
tom_zarek Apollo s one of the gods , a lord of Kobol .
tom_zarek You must be a very special man to be called a god .
cpt_lee_adama Its just a stupid nickname .
tom_zarek Son of Zeus .
tom_zarek Good with a bow , god of the hunt ... and also a god of healing .
tom_zarek Now , a god can reconcile those two opposing forces .

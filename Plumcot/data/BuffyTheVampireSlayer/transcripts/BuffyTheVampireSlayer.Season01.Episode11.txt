cordelia_chase I just love springtime.
cordelia_chase Me and bright spring fashions!
mitch Spring training.
cordelia_chase Me at the end of school dance.
harmony_kendall The end of school.
cordelia_chase Definitely. My favorite time of year. I am, of course, having my dress specially made. Off the rack gives me hives.
mitch Lemme guess: blue, like your eyes!
cordelia_chase My eyes are hazel, Helen Keller.
harmony_kendall You two will look so fine together in the May Queen photo.
cordelia_chase Well, I haven't been elected May Queen yet.
cordelia_chase Uhhh! Behold, the weirdness!
buffy_summers You're probably wondering what I'm doing with this stuff, huh?
cordelia_chase Wow, I'm not!
buffy_summers Uh, for history class. Mr. Giles has this, like, hobby of collecting stuff... which he lent me... for show and tell. D-did I mention it's for history class?
harmony_kendall She is always hanging with that creepy librarian in that creepy library.
cordelia_chase Hey, did I ever tell you about the time that she attacked me? At the Bronze? I don't know why this school admits mentals like her.
ms_miller 'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?' Okay. So talk to me, people. How does what Shylock says here about being a Jew relate to our discussion about the anger of the outcast in society?
cordelia_chase Well, how about color me totally self-involved?
ms_miller Care to elaborate?
cordelia_chase Yeah. With Shylock it's whine, whine, whine, like the whole world is about him. He acts like it's justice, him getting a pound of Antonio's flesh. It's not justice, it's yicky.
ms_miller But has Shylock suffered? What's his place in Venice society?
willow_rosenberg Well, everyone looked down on him.
cordelia_chase That is such a twinkie defense. Shylock should get over himself. People who think their problems are so huge craze me. Like this time I sort of ran over this girl on her bike. It was the most traumatizing event of *my* life, and she's trying to make it about *her* leg! Like *my* pain meant nothing.
ms_miller Well, Cordelia's raised an interesting point here. Which we'll pursue at a later time.
cordelia_chase Ms. Miller?
ms_miller Good observations today, Cordelia. It's always exciting to know someone's actually done the reading.
cordelia_chase Thanks. Um, I wanna talk to you about my final paper. I'm real unfocused. I have all these thoughts, and I'm pretty sure they all contradict each other.
ms_miller Well, I have your outline here, but why don't you stop by tomorrow after school? We'll go over it then.
cordelia_chase That'd be great! Thanks a lot.
ms_miller You're welcome. I'll see you then.
cordelia_chase Okay! Bye! Harmony!
harmony_kendall Hi!
cordelia_chase They called and said the dress is ready. It's so great! Mitch is gonna die!
bud_1 Hey, Mitch! You goin' to the Bronze?
mitch Later. I'm pickin' up my tux first.
bud_1 Uh huh.
mitch Gotta look sharp for the big dig.
bud_1 Oh, that's right! You gotta look good to be on Cordelia's arm!
mitch Oh, it's not her arm I'm lookin' to be on.
mitch Who's there?
mitch Okay, fun time's over, come out.
cordelia_chase Now, remember who to vote for for May Queen! As in me!
boy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode11 Thanks.
cordelia_chase Hi! Isn't this the bomb? I'm such the campaign strategist.
harmony_kendall 'C'. For Cordelia?
cordelia_chase No, 'C' for Wilma, little brain! Of course, 'C' for Cordelia! This way people will associate me with something sweet!
cordelia_chase Here's a chocolate... Oh. I don't think I need the loony-fringe vote.
buffy_summers Well, I-I don't even *like* chocolates. Okay, that was the lamest comeback of our times.
xander_harris So, what's Cordelia up to?
buffy_summers Bribery. She's desperate to be May Queen.
xander_harris Cordelia, man, she does love titles!
willow_rosenberg Oh, God! Remember in sixth grade with the field trip?
xander_harris Right! Right! The guy with the antlers on his belt!
willow_rosenberg Be my Deputy!
xander_harris And remember the, the hat?
willow_rosenberg Oh God! The hat!
buffy_summers Gee, it's fun that we're speaking in tongues.
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry.
xander_harris It's just that we had this, uh... You had to be there.
willow_rosenberg It's not even funny.
xander_harris Really.
willow_rosenberg Uh, Cordelia just has a history of trying too hard.
xander_harris Yeah, what kind of moron would wanna be May Queen anyway?
buffy_summers I was.
xander_harris You what?
buffy_summers At my old school.
xander_harris Oh! So the, uh, *good* kind of moron would do that. The, uh, non-moron, I mean.
buffy_summers Well, we didn't call it 'May Queen', but we had the coronation, and the dance, and all that stuff. It was nice.
xander_harris Well, you know, you don't need that anymore. You got us!
willow_rosenberg Be my Deputy! Oh, God...
bud_1 Guys! C'mon! Mitch got whaled on! I think he's...
principal_snyder Dead? Of course not. What are you, ghouls?
principal_snyder There are no dead students here. This week. Clear back, make room, all of you.
buffy_summers Mitch, what happened?
mitch I don't know. I, I heard something. I tried to grab a, a bat... that hit me.
buffy_summers What hit you?
mitch The bat! By itself, the thing was floating, it knocked me out.
buffy_summers I'd better check out the scene.
principal_snyder Where do you think you're going?
buffy_summers Um, Mitch wanted me to get his comb. He, he likes his comb.
principal_snyder I don't think Mitch needs his comb right now. I think Mitch needs medical attention.
principal_snyder And you need to stay away from the crime scene. Always sticking your nose in.
willow_rosenberg Sue? What did you say? Mitch was gonna sue the school?
principal_snyder Sue? Who?
xander_harris Well, his dad is the most powerful lawyer in Sunnydale.
principal_snyder Hold on. What have you two heard?
xander_harris His dad, the lawyer. You haven't heard of him?
willow_rosenberg Other lawyers call him 'The Beast'.
willow_rosenberg 'Look'? That's all it said?
xander_harris Look at what? Look at Mitch?
buffy_summers Maybe. All I know is it's a message.
xander_harris And...
rupert_giles Ah, here you are.
buffy_summers And monsters don't usually send messages. It's pretty much crush, kill, destroy. This was different.
rupert_giles I'd have to say you're right.
buffy_summers I love it when he says that! Any theories?
rupert_giles Uh, I'm, uh, it's a bit of a puzzle, really. Um, I've never actually heard of anyone attacked by a lone baseball bat before.
xander_harris Maybe it's a vampire bat. I'm alone with that one, huh?
rupert_giles Well, assuming the bat itself is not possessed, uh, there are a few possibilities that bear investigating. Uh, someone with telekinesis, uh, the power to move objects at will, uh, uh, an invisible creature, um, or possibly a poltergeist.
willow_rosenberg A ghost?
rupert_giles Yes, and a very angry one.
buffy_summers Yeah, I'd say. The locker room was a real scene.
willow_rosenberg If it's a ghost, then we're talking about a dead kid.
buffy_summers I guess so. You know, why don't you compile a list of dead or missing kids? It's probably a good place to start.
rupert_giles And, uh, I'll research all the possibilities, ghosts included. But, uh, Xander, if you're not doing anything, would you like to help me?
xander_harris What, so there's homework now? When did that happen?
buffy_summers It's all part of the glamorous world of vampire slayage.
xander_harris Well, what part do you have?
buffy_summers Gonna find out what I can about Mitch. This attack wasn't random.
xander_harris Well, I want that part.
buffy_summers Fine. You can do it. Ask around, talk to his friends. Talk to Cordelia!
xander_harris Talk to Cordelia? So, research, huh?
harmony_kendall Hi!
cordelia_chase Oh, hi.
harmony_kendall Cordelia, you weren't in fifth period.
cordelia_chase I went to the hospital.
harmony_kendall Oh, Mitch. How is he? Will he be okay?
cordelia_chase Well, the doctor says he'll be fine. They're gonna send him home tomorrow. But... you should've seen him lying there. All black and blue? How's he gonna look in our Prom pictures? How am I ever gonna be able to show them to anyone?
harmony_kendall Well, they can do wonderful things with airbrushes these days.
cordelia_chase You think?
harmony_kendall Hi!
cordelia_chase Hi! Did you see Mitch? He just broke up with Wendy eight seconds ago, and he's already nosing around.
harmony_kendall It's shameless!
cordelia_chase In the spring, if he makes varsity baseball, maybe I'll take him on a test drive.
marcie_ross Hi, guys!
cordelia_chase What do *you* want?
cordelia_chase I just hope they can prop him up long enough to take the picture.
buffy_summers Cordelia, can I talk to you?
cordelia_chase Oh, great.
harmony_kendall Why is she always try... Uff!
cordelia_chase Harmony!
principal_snyder Oh, for heaven sakes! Clear back, everyone! Give her some air! You! School nurse, now!
harmony_kendall Ow! Oh, my ankle! I think it's broken.
buffy_summers What happened?
principal_snyder Hey! Who's the principal here? What happened?
cordelia_chase She fell! She, she, we were standing at the top of the stairs and she just fell! All by herself!
harmony_kendall No! I was pushed!
harmony_kendall Ow!
principal_snyder Don't sue.
buffy_summers Is anybody here?
buffy_summers Hey! Who's here?
buffy_summers Okay, I know someone's here. Look, I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk to you.
buffy_summers Giles, have you ever touched a ghost?
rupert_giles Uh, no. From what I've heard, uh, having a, a ghost pass through you is a singular experience. It's a, it's a rather, uh, cold amorphous feeling. It makes your hair stand on end.
buffy_summers You see, that's my problem. I touched the thing, but it didn't go through me. It bumped into me. And it wasn't cold.
xander_harris So, we're talking about what, an invisible person?
buffy_summers A girl. She laughed.
rupert_giles A girl on campus with the ability to become invisible.
xander_harris That is so cool!
willow_rosenberg Cool?
xander_harris Well, yeah, I would give anything to be able to turn invisible. Well, I wouldn't use my powers to beat people up, but I'd use my powers to protect the girls' locker room.
rupert_giles It must be a fairly heady experience... having that ability.
willow_rosenberg How'd she get it? Is she a witch? 'Cause we can fight a witch.
xander_harris Hmm. Greek myths speak of cloaks of invisibility, but they're usually for the gods. Research Boy comes through with the knowledge!
buffy_summers This girl's sorta petty for a god.
willow_rosenberg She's got a grudge. But why Harmony?
xander_harris Harmony and Mitch. The common denominator is...
buffy_summers Cordelia!
willow_rosenberg So what now?
buffy_summers First thing tomorrow, why don't you pull up that missing kids list?
willow_rosenberg Got it. I'll see ya then.
buffy_summers Bye.
xander_harris See ya. Oh, hey, do you wanna come to our place tonight for dinner? Mom's making her famous phone call to the Chinese place.
willow_rosenberg Xander, do you guys even have a stove?
rupert_giles So, I'll look into ways that you can de-cloak an invisible someone. What about you?
buffy_summers I think Cordelia's gonna be workin' on her May Queen dress tonight. Maybe there'll be some action. Guess I'm gonna start the hunt.
rupert_giles How exactly do you propose to hunt someone you can't see?
rupert_giles You may have to work on listening to people.
buffy_summers Very funny.
rupert_giles I thought so.
cordelia_chase Should I wear my hair up? Do you think I should wear it up?
cordelia_chase How does the, um, hem go? Is it, is it long enough, or...
cordelia_chase Isn't it beautiful?
rupert_giles Who's there?
rupert_giles A vampire casts no reflection.
angel Don't worry. I'm not here to eat.
rupert_giles Buffy told me you don't feed from humans anymore.
angel Not for a long while.
rupert_giles Is that why you're here? To see her?
angel I can't. It's, uh... It's too hard for me to be around her.
rupert_giles A vampire in love with a Slayer! It's rather poetic! In a maudlin sort of way. What can I, uh... What can I do for you?
angel I know you've been researching the Master.
rupert_giles Yes, the vampire king. I've tried to learn as much as I can about him for the day that Buffy must face him.
angel Something's already in motion, something big, but I don't know what. You've read all the Slayer lore there is, right?
rupert_giles I-I've studied all the extant volumes, of course. But the, uh, most salient books of Slayer prophecy have been lost. The Tiberius Manifesto, the Pergamum Codex...
angel The Codex?
rupert_giles It's reputed to have contained the most complete prophecies about the Slayer's role in the end years. Unfortunately, the book was lost in the 15th century.
angel Not lost. Misplaced. I can get it.
rupert_giles That would be most helpful! Uh, m-my own volumes have... been rather useless of late.
angel Legends of Vishnu?
rupert_giles There's an... invisible girl terrorizing the school.
angel That's not really my area of expertise.
rupert_giles Nor mine, I'm afraid. Uh, it's fascinating, though. By all accounts it's a, a... a wonderful power to possess.
angel Oh, I don't know. Looking in the mirror everyday and seeing nothing there. It's an overrated pleasure.
cordelia_chase God! I am never sitting through another one of those alumni lectures again. Two hours of 'My Trek Through Nepal'. Hello! There is nobody caring.
marcie_ross And did you guys see his toupee? I mean, it looks like a cabbage.
cordelia_chase And those slides! 'That's a mountain. That's a mountain, too. Now look at some mountains.'
harmony_kendall I swear, he had three slides and just used them over and over.
marcie_ross I know, but did you guys see his toupee? I mean, it was, like, the worst!
harmony_kendall We're talking, okay?
cordelia_chase Oh! And did you guys check out that extreme toupee? Yeah, that's realistic. It looked like a cabbage.
principal_snyder The winner is Cordelia Chase!
principal_snyder Let's bring up our new May Queen.
cordelia_chase Thank you for making the right choice, and for showing me how much you all love me. Being this popular is not just my right, but my responsibility, and I want you to know I take it very seriously.
cordelia_chase It all began when...
xander_harris So, Giles said you'd be here. Why are you being here?
buffy_summers Last night was a bust. But I still think Cordy's the key.
willow_rosenberg This is the dead and missing list. I pulled up their classes, activities, medical records...
buffy_summers Good work.
willow_rosenberg Has Cordelia hired a bodyguard or something?
buffy_summers Hey, you guys, check out this one. It's the most recent one, Marcie Ross, disappeared, like, six months ago.
xander_harris I don't know her.
willow_rosenberg Me neither.
buffy_summers Her only activity was band. She played the flute.
willow_rosenberg So?
buffy_summers Well, last night when I was hunting, I heard this flute, but I couldn't figure out where it was coming from. And it was in the band room that I lost Miss Invisible yesterday. You know what, this all tracks. I'm gonna check it out. See you guys later?
xander_harris Okay, we'll see you after geometry.
cordelia_chase Ask not what your school can do for you, ask: Hey! What am I wearing to the Spring Fling?
buffy_summers Marcie Ross. So it is you.
ms_miller Cordelia, could you possibly be on time?
ms_miller Who's there?
cordelia_chase Ms. Miller? Oh, my God! Ms. Miller! Oh, my God! Are you okay?
cordelia_chase Ms. Miller, what happened?
ms_miller Attacked. Didn't see.
rupert_giles A nest?
buffy_summers It looked like she'd been there for months. It's where I found this.
willow_rosenberg Oh, my God! 'Have a nice summer. Have a nice summer.' This girl had no friends at all.
rupert_giles Uh, once again I teeter at the precipice of the generation gap.
buffy_summers 'Have a nice summer' is what you write when you have nothing to say.
xander_harris It's the kiss of death.
buffy_summers You guys didn't know Marcie Ross?
xander_harris Never met her. Why?
buffy_summers 'Cause you both wrote it, too.
xander_harris 'Have a nice...' Yeesh!
willow_rosenberg Where am I? Oh. 'Have a *great* summer.' See, I cared!
buffy_summers You guys don't remember her?
xander_harris No, I probably didn't see her except to sign the book. I mean, this is a big school.
willow_rosenberg Xander, we each had four classes with her last year.
buffy_summers So, no one noticed her, and now she's invisible.
xander_harris What, she turned invisible because no one noticed her?
rupert_giles Of course! I've been investigating the mystical causes of invisibility when I, I should have looked at the quantum mechanical! Physics.
buffy_summers I think I speak for everyone here when I say, huh?
rupert_giles It's a rudimentary concept that, that reality is shaped, even, even... created by our perception.
buffy_summers And with the Hellmouth below us sending out mystical energy...
rupert_giles People perceived Marcie as, as, as invisible, and, and, and, and she became so.
ms_miller So, who knows the answer to this one? Think about it.
ms_miller Cordelia?
cordelia_chase Well, just because the story's about him, doesn't necessarily mean he's the hero, right?
ms_miller Exactly. So, what do we call him? Willow?
willow_rosenberg Well, the protagonist.
ms_miller Xander?
xander_harris Why can't he be both? I mean, he did do some things that are pretty heroic.
ms_miller Absolutely. Who doesn't agree with that?
ms_miller Okay.
ms_miller And how about you?
buffy_summers This isn't this great power that she can control. It's something that was done to her. That *we* did to her.
willow_rosenberg No wonder she's miffed.
xander_harris What does she want?
buffy_summers Just what we thought. Cordelia.
cordelia_chase What? I knew you'd be here. Buffy, I, uh, I, I know we've had our differences, with you being so weird and all, and hanging out with these total losers...
cordelia_chase Ooo! Well, anyway, despite all of that, I know that you share this feeling that we have for each other, deep down...
willow_rosenberg Nausea?
cordelia_chase Somebody is after me! They just tried to kill Ms. Miller? Uh, she was helping me with my homework. And Mitch! And Harmony?! This is all about me! Me, me, me!
xander_harris Wow! For once she's right!
buffy_summers So you've come to *me* for help.
cordelia_chase Because you're always around when all this weird stuff is happening. And I know you're very strong, and you've got all those weapons... I was kind of hoping you were in a gang.
cordelia_chase Please! I don't have anyone else to turn to!
rupert_giles Please. Sit down.
cordelia_chase Okay. Thanks.
rupert_giles You know, I... I don't recall ever seeing you here before.
cordelia_chase Oh, no, I have a life.
buffy_summers Okay. Cordelia, your attacker is an invisible girl.
xander_harris Who is really, really angry at you, which I... can't imagine personally, but it... takes all kinds, y'know?
cordelia_chase Well, I don't care what it is, just get rid of it!
buffy_summers Well, it's not that simple, it's a person, it's... It's this person. Now, do you have any idea why she'd be so...
cordelia_chase Oh, God! Is she really wearing Laura Ashley?
xander_harris So homicidal?
cordelia_chase I have no idea! I've never seen this girl before in my life!
marcie_ross I won 'cause you didn't see me coming. Cordelia, you don't remember me. I remember you, all your idiot slut friends, I hate them. They take your life and they suck it out of you! But then they didn't see me coming. They gotta learn. They gotta learn.
rupert_giles According to what you told us about the attack on Ms. Miller, we now have two messages from Marcie: 'look' and 'listen'.
willow_rosenberg Messages we don't understand.
buffy_summers I don't think we're supposed to... yet. Marcie's not quite ready. But from what she did to Cordelia's picture, I would say that she's wigged on the whole May Queen thing. Maybe she's gonna do something about it.
willow_rosenberg Stop the coronation tonight, maybe. Keep you guys away from the Bronze?
cordelia_chase Nothing is keeping me from the Bronze tonight!
xander_harris Uh, can we just revel in your fabulous lack of priorities?
cordelia_chase If I'm not crowned tonight then, then Marcie's won! And that would be bad. She's evil, okay? Way eviler than me.
buffy_summers Cordelia has a point.
cordelia_chase Buffy's with me on this.
buffy_summers Anyway, continuing the normal May Queen activities may be the best way to draw Marcie out. We can use Cordelia as bait.
cordelia_chase Great! Bait?
rupert_giles Willow, Xander, you'll help me begin our research anew. Unless we find a way to cure Marcie's invisibility, then Buffy will be...
buffy_summers A sitting duck.
buffy_summers C'mon.
cordelia_chase Well, I have to try on my dress. And am I really bait?
cordelia_chase So, how much the creepy is it that this Marcie's been at this for months? Spying on us? Learning our most guarded secrets? So, are you saying she's invisible because she's so unpopular?
buffy_summers That about sums it up.
cordelia_chase Bummer for her. It's awful to feel that lonely.
buffy_summers Hmm. So you've read something about the feeling?
cordelia_chase Hey! You think I'm never lonely because I'm so cute and popular? I can be surrounded by people and be completely alone. It's not like any of them really know me. I don't even know if they like me half the time. People just want to be in a popular zone. Sometimes when I talk, everyone's so busy agreeing with me, they don't hear a word I say.
buffy_summers Well, if you feel so alone, then why do you work so hard at being popular?
cordelia_chase Well, it beats being alone all by yourself.
willow_rosenberg Shhh! Listen!
rupert_giles Come on.
rupert_giles We could... talk to her. Perhaps reason with her. Or possibly grab her.
willow_rosenberg There are three of us.
xander_harris Let's go!
cordelia_chase If you ever tell to anyone that I changed in a mop closet...
buffy_summers Your secret dies with me. Looks okay. But hurry.
cordelia_chase Okay.
xander_harris Over here.
rupert_giles Marcie? We know what happened to you. Please, can we talk to you?
willow_rosenberg We're sorry we ignored you.
xander_harris Can you say 'gulp'?
rupert_giles What's that sound?
buffy_summers You know what you were saying before? I understand. Somehow it doesn't seem to matter how popular you are when...
cordelia_chase You were popular? In what alternate universe?
buffy_summers In L.A. Th-the point is, I did sort of feel like something was missing.
cordelia_chase Is that when you became weird and got kicked out?
buffy_summers Okay. Can we have the heartfelt talk with a little less talk from you? Cordelia?
buffy_summers Cordelia!
buffy_summers Cordelia!
cordelia_chase Buffy!
rupert_giles It's gas. She's snuffed out the pilot light! The gas is on full! I can't find the shutoff valve.
xander_harris Is this it?
willow_rosenberg Okay, that's bad. How 'bout the door?
rupert_giles NO! One spark and you'll take the whole building with us!
buffy_summers Cordelia! Cordelia! Oh, my God!
cordelia_chase Buffy? You're awake?
buffy_summers Yeah.
cordelia_chase I can't feel my face!
buffy_summers What do you mean?
cordelia_chase My face. My face is numb. What is she doing?
buffy_summers I don't know.
cordelia_chase What does that mean?
buffy_summers I don't know.
rupert_giles That should give us a few minutes, but we b... If we don't get out of this room soon...
willow_rosenberg Why is Marcie doing this?
rupert_giles The loneliness, the constant exile, she's... she has gone mad!
xander_harris Ya think?
marcie_ross Uh, I'm disappointed. I'd really hoped you guys had figured it out by now.
buffy_summers Well, why don't you explain it? C'mon, Marcie, what are we supposed to learn?
cordelia_chase Yeah, what do you wanna teach us!
marcie_ross You don't get it. You're not the student. You're the lesson.
cordelia_chase What did you do to my face?
marcie_ross Your face. That's what this is all about, isn't it? Your beautiful face. That's what makes you shine just a little bit brighter than the rest of us. We all want what you have. To be noticed, remembered. To be seen.
cordelia_chase What are you doing?
marcie_ross Well, I'm fulfilling your fondest wish.
marcie_ross I'm gonna give you a face no one will ever forget.
rupert_giles One, two, three!
rupert_giles Again!
buffy_summers Marcie, you can't do this.
marcie_ross What are you gonna do? Slay me?
buffy_summers Marcie, you know this is wrong.
marcie_ross You shoulda stayed outta my way. Y'know, I, I thought, I thought you would understand my vision, but you're just like them.
cordelia_chase Please don't do this! Nooohohoho!
marcie_ross You should be grateful. I mean, people who pass you in the street are gonna remember you for the rest of their lives.
marcie_ross Children are gonna dream about you. And every one of your, your friends who comes to the coronation tonight will take the sight of the May Queen to their graves.
cordelia_chase Wait!
marcie_ross No, we really have to get started. The local anesthetic's gonna wear off soon, and I don't want you to faint. It's less fun if you're not awake.
xander_harris You guys are... I'm blacking out on you.
marcie_ross Let me see. I think we should start with your smile. I think it should be wider.
cordelia_chase Marcie, I know you think I don't understand, but I do!
marcie_ross Yeah, I'll *bet* you know how I feel. I'm sure you can just be with all your friends and feel so alone 'cause they don't really know you. You're just a typical, self-involved, spoiled little brat, and you think you can charm your way out of this, don't you?! ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU THINK?!
marcie_ross I see right through you.
cordelia_chase Oh, my God! Get me out of here, please!
buffy_summers Hold still!
cordelia_chase Uh, huh, huh, oh, my God!
angel Come on!
xander_harris What happened?
angel You tell me.
willow_rosenberg I'm up, mom.
xander_harris Hi! What do you want?
angel I brought you the Codex. I came in through the basement. I smelled the gas.
rupert_giles Yes, w-w-well shut it off, otherwise, uh, the whole building will go up!
angel I'll get it. It's not like I need the oxygen.
rupert_giles Come on, let's get out of here.
buffy_summers Y'know, I really felt sorry for you. You've suffered. There's one thing I really didn't factor into all this. You're a thundering loony!
cordelia_chase Buffy, are you okay?
cordelia_chase Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
cordelia_chase Buffy!
cordelia_chase Buffy! Oh, my God!
marcie_ross Hey, moron! I'm invisible! How are you gonna fight someone you can't see?
cordelia_chase Oh, my God!
buffy_summers Cordelia, shut up.
cordelia_chase Okay.
buffy_summers I see you.
agent_doyle Everybody stay where you are.
agent_doyle FBI! Nobody move!
agent_manetti Okay, we'll take it from here now, ma'am.
buffy_summers Take what from where?
agent_doyle I'm agent Doyle, this is Agent Manetti. We're here for the girl.
buffy_summers Well, where were you ten minutes ago when she was playing surgeon?
agent_doyle I'm sorry, we came as fast as we could.
marcie_ross Oh, my God!
agent_doyle We'll take it from here on.
agent_doyle C'mon.
buffy_summers You can cure her?
agent_doyle We can rehabilitate her.
agent_manetti In time she'll learn to be a useful member of society again.
marcie_ross Where are we going?
agent_doyle Very useful.
buffy_summers This isn't the first time this has happened, is it? It's happened at other schools.
agent_manetti We're not at liberty to discuss that.
agent_doyle It would be best for you to forget this whole incident.
buffy_summers Do you know that you guys are very creepy?
agent_doyle Thank you for your help.
agent_manetti Oh, and, uh... have a nice day.
cordelia_chase Can I get untied now?
buffy_summers I just can't believe how twisted Marcie got. By the way, how did you guys get out of the boiler room?
xander_harris Oh, well, when the gas was coming down, we...
rupert_giles Janitor, um, found us. Shut the valve off.
willow_rosenberg We were lucky.
buffy_summers I'll say.
cordelia_chase Hi.
buffy_summers Hey!
cordelia_chase Look, um, I didn't get a chance to say anything yesterday with the coronation and everything... but, um, I guess I just wanted to say thank you, all of you.
xander_harris That's funny, 'cause she *looks* like Cordelia.
cordelia_chase You really helped me out yesterday, and you didn't have to. So, thank you.
buffy_summers It's okay.
willow_rosenberg Listen, we were gonna grab lunch in a minute if you wanted to...
mitch Whoa, whoa. You're not hangin' with these losers, are you?
cordelia_chase Uhhh! Are you kidding? Heh! I was just being charitable. Helping them with their fashion problems. Heh. You think I really felt like joining *that* social leper colony? Puh-leeease!
xander_harris Boy, where's an invisible girl when you really need one?
agent_doyle I think you'll be happy here.
agent_manetti You should fit right in.

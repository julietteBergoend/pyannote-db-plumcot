Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode09 I will be whole. I will be new.
cordelia_chase Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all. I decided long ago...
cordelia_chase ...never to walk in anyone's shadow. If I fail, if I succeed, at least...
rupert_giles Thank you, Cordelia. Tha-that's going to be lovely.
cordelia_chase But I didn't do the part with the sparklers!
rupert_giles Um, w-we'll, um... save that for the dress rehearsal. Uh, Lisa! Please!
cordelia_chase Uhhh!
buffy_summers If it isn't the great producer!
xander_harris Had to see this to believe it.
rupert_giles Oh. You three.
buffy_summers The school talent show. How ever did you finagle such a primo assignment?
rupert_giles Our new Führer, Mr. Snyder.
willow_rosenberg I think they call 'em 'principals' now.
rupert_giles Mm. He thought it would behoove me to have more contact with the students. I did try to explain that my vocational choice of librarian was a deliberate attempt to minimize said contact, but, uh, he would have none of it.
buffy_summers Giles, unto every generation is born one who must run the annual talentless show. You cannot escape your destiny.
rupert_giles If you had any shred of decency, you would have participated, or at least, um, helped.
buffy_summers Nah! I think I'll take on your traditional role... and watch!
xander_harris And mock!
willow_rosenberg And laugh!
buffy_summers O-kay. I think maybe we better leave our Mr. Giles to this business he calls a show.
buffy_summers Principal Snyder!
principal_snyder So. We think school events are stupid, and we think authority figures are to be made fun of.
buffy_summers No! No, we don't. W-unless you do.
principal_snyder And we think our afternoon classes are optional. All three of you left campus yesterday.
buffy_summers Yeah, but we were fighting a demon...
principal_snyder Fighting?
buffy_summers Not fighting.
xander_harris No, we, uh, left to *avoid* fighting.
principal_snyder Real anti-social types. You need to integrate into this school, people. I think I just found three eager new participants for the talent show.
buffy_summers What?
xander_harris No!
willow_rosenberg Please?
principal_snyder I've been watching you three. Always getting into one scrape or another.
buffy_summers Well, we're really, really sorry, but about the talent show, pleeease, you can't make us...
principal_snyder My predecessor, Mr. Flutie, may have gone in for all that touchy-feely relating nonsense, but he was eaten. You're in *my* world now. And Sunnydale has touched and felt for the last time.
xander_harris Can I just mention, that detention is a time-honored form of punishment?
principal_snyder I know the three of you will come up with a wonderful act for the school to watch. And mock. And laugh. At.
xander_harris No!
rupert_giles Thank you!
buffy_summers Ewww, dummy!
xander_harris Dyow! Mime!
willow_rosenberg I think dummies are cute. You don't?
buffy_summers Uuuhhh. They give me the wig. Ever since I was little.
willow_rosenberg What happened?
buffy_summers I saw a dummy. It gave me the wig. There really wasn't a story there.
morgan_shay Hi. I'm Morgan. And I'm Sid!
morgan_shay Hey Morgan, would you like to tell some jokes? Would I! As a matter of fact, it is! It's also a wood nose, and a wood mouth!
morgan_shay I didn't sleep at all last night.
sid Alright, time out. Let's stop this before someone gets hurt. Kid, you are the worst. Even I can see your lips move.
morgan_shay C'mon, Sid. You're spoiling my act. I worked on these jokes for weeks.
sid You call those jokes? My jockey shorts are made out of better material.
sid And they're edible!
rupert_giles There, you see? I'm sure you three can come up with something... equally exciting.
emily_ Is anybody there?
emily_ Hello?
emily_ Hello?
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode09 I will be flesh!
marc I reach into the hat, and out... comes...
marc Has anybody seen a rabbit?
xander_harris I can't do this!
buffy_summers Xander, come on.
xander_harris I, I can't! I have my pride! Okay, I don't have a lot of my pride, but I have enough so that I can't do this!
willow_rosenberg A dramatic scene is the easiest way to get through the talent show, because it doesn't require an actual talent.
xander_harris But we have talent. We can do stuff. Buffy, uh...
buffy_summers What am I gonna do? Slay vampires on stage?
willow_rosenberg Maybe in a funny way!
xander_harris Willow, you can do stuff. Uh, the piano...
buffy_summers You play?
willow_rosenberg A little.
buffy_summers Well, that's cool. You can accompany us and we can *attempt* to sing.
willow_rosenberg Oh, i-in front of other people? Then, no, I don't play...
xander_harris Whatever happened to corporal punishment?
sid Mm, mm, mm. Look at the goodies!
willow_rosenberg Morgan, you're really getting good! Where did you come up with that voice?
morgan_shay It's kind of an imitation of my dad.
buffy_summers Sounds real!
sid It is real. I'm the one with the talent here. The kid's dead weight. How about you and I do a little rehearsin' on our own, honey?
xander_harris Uh, hey!
sid You know what they say: once you go wood, nothin's as good!
buffy_summers Okay, Morgan. We get the joke. Horny dummy, ha, ha, it's very funny, but you might wanna consider getting some new schtick. Unless you want your prop ending up as a Duraflame log.
principal_snyder Kids today need discipline. That's an unpopular word these days, 'discipline'. I know Principal Flutie would have said, 'Kids need understanding. Kids are human beings.' That's the kind of woolly-headed, liberal thinking that leads to being eaten.
rupert_giles I, I think perhaps it was a little more complex than, um...
principal_snyder This place has quite a reputation. Suicide, missing persons, spontaneous cheerleader combustion... You can't put up with that. You've gotta keep an eye on the bad element.
principal_snyder Like those three.
principal_snyder Kids. I don't like them. From now on you're gonna see a very different Sunnydale High. Tight ship, clean, orderly, and quiet.
rupert_giles It was Emily.
willow_rosenberg Emily. Dancer Emily?
xander_harris Oh, man! I hate this school.
rupert_giles Uh, it must have happened just after, uh, dress rehearsals. There was a cross-country meet at Melville. She, she, she never showed up for it.
buffy_summers Vampire?
rupert_giles Um, I think not.
buffy_summers Giles, share! What happened?
rupert_giles Her heart was removed.
willow_rosenberg Yikes!
buffy_summers Does that mean anything to you? Besides ooooooo?
rupert_giles Uh... There are various demons which, which feed off human hearts, but...
buffy_summers But demons have claws. And teeth.
xander_harris They got no use for a big old knife.
rupert_giles Which more than likely makes our murderer...
buffy_summers Human.
xander_harris Did I mention that I *hate* this school?
willow_rosenberg So Emily was killed by a regular human person.
rupert_giles The evidence certainly points that way.
buffy_summers No, wait. I-I'm not buying, you guys. Remember the Hellmouth? Mystical activity is totally rife here. This to me says demon.
rupert_giles I'd like to think you're right. A demon is a creature of evil, pure and very simple. A person driven to kill is, is, um, it's more complex.
willow_rosenberg The creep factor is also heightened. It could be anyone. It could be me! It's not, though.
rupert_giles Uh, demon or no, we have some investigating to do. I suggest we start with your... your talent show compatriots. One of them may have been the last to see her alive.
lisa I didn't know her too well. There's that whole dancer/band rivalry, y'know?
buffy_summers I've heard about that.
lisa But I did speak to her a little the day that... yesterday.
buffy_summers How did she seem?
marc She was happy. I guess. She was psyched to be doing the show. She was a really good dancer. Here, pick a card.
rupert_giles Uh, um...
marc No, wai-wai-wai-wait. Not that one. Pick this one.
rupert_giles Do you remember the last time you saw her?
marc She was talkin' to someone.
rupert_giles Who?
elliot That smart guy. The one with the dummy. What's his name?
willow_rosenberg Morgan?
elliot Yeah, that's it. He was actin' kinda strange.
willow_rosenberg Strange how?
cordelia_chase It's just such a tragedy for me. Emma was, like, my best friend.
xander_harris Emily.
lisa Well, Morgan's just strange. He's always rubbing his head a lot and moaning. Especially the other day.
marc He seemed kinda paranoid... Lookin' around at everyone...
elliot And I think I saw him arguing... with his dummy.
cordelia_chase All I can think is, it coulda been me!
xander_harris We can dream.
sid Right now you and me gotta be on the lookout. Figure out who's gonna be next.
morgan_shay How are we supposed to... Oh, hi.
buffy_summers Hello.
morgan_shay I was just working on throwing my voice.
buffy_summers Uh, Morgan, did you notice anything weird going on around here yesterday?
morgan_shay Weird? What d'you mean?
buffy_summers With Emily. Did she say anything to you, was she arguing with anyone?
morgan_shay No. She was dancing. Sid and I were talking.
buffy_summers Talking.
morgan_shay Rehearsing.
buffy_summers So, you didn't notice anything weird at...
morgan_shay Ohhh!
buffy_summers Morgan, are you okay?
sid Look, sweetheart! He answered your question. Now leave him alone!
buffy_summers Okay, Morgan, how 'bout talking to me yourself now?
sid He said all he's gonna say.
morgan_shay It's okay, Sid. We're done.
buffy_summers I'm sorry. Look, I didn't mean to make you mad.
morgan_shay No! I'm... It's him! He's... We have to go.
buffy_summers Cute couple.
xander_harris Okay, next time we split up someone else is on Cordy detail. Five more minutes with her and we woulda had another organ donor.
willow_rosenberg I think I had a bit more luck. Everyone I talked to seemed to point their fingers at the same person.
buffy_summers Morgan?
willow_rosenberg Morgan.
xander_harris We have a winner!
rupert_giles I fear I was led to the same conclusion.
xander_harris Well, what do we do? We don't slay him, right? We wanna bring him to justice.
willow_rosenberg We could set up a complex sting operation where we get him to confess!
xander_harris Uh, I should wear a wire!
buffy_summers Whoa, hey, you guys, all we know is that Morgan is a grade A large weirdo. That doesn't lead directly to murderer.
xander_harris Guy talks to his puppet!
willow_rosenberg And for his puppet.
buffy_summers Well, yeah, but what about the whole 'it's a demon' theory?
rupert_giles I'm looking into that, but, uh, my investigation is somewhat... hampered by our life in the theater.
buffy_summers Uh, priority check, Giles? Talent show, murder.
xander_harris Yeah, we can't do the talent show, it's unthinkable. I'm not able to think it!
rupert_giles Principal Snyder is watching us all very closely. Now, if he chooses, he can make all our lives extremely difficult. A Slayer cannot afford that! We will find this murderer, but in the meantime... the show must go on.
buffy_summers This is so unfair.
rupert_giles Buffy, you, uh, watch Morgan. Check his locker, see if there's anything there.
willow_rosenberg Like a heart?
rupert_giles Or something.
buffy_summers Alright.
willow_rosenberg I'll pull up his locker number.
xander_harris Can I still wear a wire?
buffy_summers Okay... Two to the left, three to the right...
buffy_summers Principal Snyder!
principal_snyder What are you doing?
buffy_summers Uh, looking for something.
principal_snyder School hours are over. You, therefore, should be gone.
buffy_summers And I'm going any minute now.
principal_snyder There are things I will not tolerate: students loitering on campus after school, horrible murders with hearts being removed. And also smoking.
buffy_summers Well, I don't do any of those things. Not... ever.
principal_snyder There's something going on with you. I'll figure it out sooner or later. Do you need something here?
buffy_summers Oh! Yeah! Right! Um, a friend wanted me to get something... out of his case!
buffy_summers He must've taken it and just forgotten to tell me.
principal_snyder Mm-hmm.
principal_snyder Get along home now. It's late.
morgan_shay No, I can't do it!
sid It's the only way.
morgan_shay I don't want...
sid She's the one.
morgan_shay But...
sid You saw what she did, how strong she is.
morgan_shay I know, but...
sid She's the last! Just this one more, and I'll be free.
morgan_shay I won't.
sid I will!
joyce_summers Hi, hon. How's it, uh, going with the talent show?
buffy_summers It'll be over soon.
joyce_summers It can't be that bad! I, for one, am looking forward to seeing your act.
buffy_summers Seeing? I-in the sense of actually attending?
joyce_summers Of course!
buffy_summers Uh-uh! No, Mom, y-y-you can't! And, I mean, if I know you're out there watching, I'll freeze up, stage fright.
joyce_summers But I wanna support what you're doing!
buffy_summers Look, Mom, if you really love me, and wanna show your support, you'll stay away. Far away.
joyce_summers Honey, is there, uh... Is there something bothering you? I-I mean, besides your fabulous debut.
buffy_summers Nothing. There's just a lot going on right now.
joyce_summers Well. Get some sleep. You'll feel better in the morning.
buffy_summers Good plan.
joyce_summers Honey, what is it?
buffy_summers In the bed, in the covers there's something!
joyce_summers Where?
buffy_summers There's something there.
joyce_summers Well, well, there, there's nothing there now. Are, are you sure you didn't have a nightmare?
buffy_summers No! There's some... There is... Yeah... You're probably right. I'm sorry I got you up.
joyce_summers Don't worry about it. I was dreaming about bills. Sweetheart, you shouldn't go to sleep with the window open.
buffy_summers I didn't.
marc And my lovely assistant steps into the box...
marc And... behold!
marc You were supposed to leave!
cordelia_chase I don't understand why I... why I have to follow Brett and his stupid band.
rupert_giles Because we have to clear their equipment before the finale. I told you.
cordelia_chase But the mood! It'll be all wrong! My song is about dignity and human feelings and personal... hygiene or something. Anyway, it's sappy, and no one is gonna be feeling sappy after all that Rock and Roll.
cordelia_chase Uhhh, what?
rupert_giles Oh! I'm sorry. Um, your hair, uh...
cordelia_chase There's something wrong with my hair?
cordelia_chase Ohmigod!
rupert_giles Xander was right. It worked like a charm.
rupert_giles Hello. You look a bit worse for, uh...
rupert_giles What exactly are you the worse for?
buffy_summers Where's Morgan?
rupert_giles Uh, I, I... haven't seen him.
xander_harris Did he do something to you?
buffy_summers No, it was his... Sid, the dummy.
buffy_summers Okay, everyone look at me like I'm in a bunny suit, 'cause that's how stupid I feel saying this... I think Sid was in my room last night.
willow_rosenberg With Morgan?
buffy_summers No. He was alone. And alive.
xander_harris Did you see him?
buffy_summers Well, I saw something. I-it ran across my floor, under my bed and then it attacked me.
rupert_giles Attacked you? How?
buffy_summers It was like it pounced on my face.
xander_harris Like a cat.
buffy_summers Yeah, exactly! But when I turned the lights on it was already gone. I-I think it went out my window.
xander_harris Like a cat.
buffy_summers Yeah! No! It was Sid, the dummy.
rupert_giles Or possibly the nightmare of somebody who had... dummies on her mind.
willow_rosenberg You did say they creep you out.
buffy_summers Excuse me? Can I have a *little* support here, please? I'm not just some crazy person, I'm the Slayer.
xander_harris The dummy Slayer? There's nothing funny about that.
willow_rosenberg Well, on the side of the 'Morgan's just crazy' theory there is, well, Morgan.
buffy_summers I'd like to see Morgan without his better half for a few minutes. Bet he could tell me something.
rupert_giles Oh, uh, i-if it's any consolation, I... I may have found a possible demon culprit. The-there's a reference in here to a brotherhood of seven demons who take, uh, the form of young humans. Every seven years these demons need human organs, a-a-a brain and a heart, to maintain their humanity. Otherwise they, they, they revert back to their original form, which is, uh, uh, slightly less appealing.
willow_rosenberg So Morgan could still be the guy, only demon Morgan instead of crazy Morgan.
rupert_giles It's said that these demons are, are, are preternaturally strong, and, and, and... Morgan is, is... Well, he seems to be getting weaker every day.
mrs_jackson It was as a result of this that President Monroe put forth the eponymous, meaning named after one's self, Monroe Doctrine, which in one sense established the U.S. as a local peacekeeper.
cordelia_chase Looks like someone digs you. That's adorable. You and the dummy could tour in the freak show!
mrs_jackson Okay, who can tell me how Spain responded to this policy?
mrs_jackson Morgan? Morgan?
morgan_shay What?
sid Morgan has other things on his mind.
mrs_jackson Give me your puppet.
morgan_shay I'll put him away.
mrs_jackson You'll get it back after school.
mrs_jackson Okay, then. In the first part of the nineteenth century...
sid I'm still watchin' you.
mrs_jackson Morgan, that is enough!
morgan_shay Mrs. Jackson.
mrs_jackson Morgan.
morgan_shay You said you'd give me...
mrs_jackson Oh, of course.
mrs_jackson Y'know, I wanted to ask you, is everything okay? At home, here at school?
morgan_shay Yeah, it's great.
mrs_jackson I feel like you've become... a little detached.
morgan_shay Mm!
mrs_jackson You're one of the brightest kids I've seen in a long time, but lately it seems like you're not all there.
mrs_jackson Try not to let other things get in the way.
morgan_shay Okay! Can I get Sid now?
mrs_jackson Sure.
mrs_jackson It's gone!
morgan_shay Gone? Whadaya mean, gone? Where could he have gone?
mrs_jackson I put it right here.
morgan_shay He knew to wait for me. He knew I'd be back.
mrs_jackson What do you mean 'he'?
morgan_shay What did you do with him? Where is he?
buffy_summers Where did you get that?
xander_harris Oh, I, uh, took it out of Mrs. Jackson's cupboard. I thought you said you wanted to be able to speak to Morgan alone, and uh... well, Morgan's alone, and, uh... Sid's with me.
xander_harris Hi, Buffy! Hi, Willow! Would you like to hear some off-color jokes?
buffy_summers I really don't think you should be doing that.
xander_harris What? C'mon... I'm not real!
buffy_summers Xander, quit it!
xander_harris He's... not... real! I think our demonstration proves that, uh, Sid is wood. Now, why don't you go and find Morgan and prove he's... whatever he is?
rupert_giles I imagine he's looking for his puppet.
buffy_summers I'll go find Morgan. You watch the dummy.
xander_harris Bye-bye, now. I'm completely inanimate.
xander_harris Redrum! Redruuum!
willow_rosenberg What do we do with him?
xander_harris Eh, I'll keep him company.
rupert_giles Willow, we have some hunting of our own to do.
willow_rosenberg Once again I'm banished to the demon section of the card catalog.
rupert_giles You concentrate on re-animation theory. I'll peck about in organ harvesting. Unless, of course, you prefer...
willow_rosenberg That's okay, you can have the organs.
xander_harris So, I guess it's just... you and me, huh? That looks more comfortable.
buffy_summers Morgan?
buffy_summers Morgan?
buffy_summers Principal Snyder!
principal_snyder Looking for something?
buffy_summers Have you seen Morgan Shay?
principal_snyder You know, with everything that's been going on recently, I'm not sure how safe it is for a girl like yourself to be here... alone.
buffy_summers Well, I was just leaving. And I know how to take care of myself.
principal_snyder Alright, then.
willow_rosenberg Look what I found in the section on toys and magic: 'On rare occasions inanimate objects of human quality, such as dolls and mannequins, already mystically possessed of consciousness, have acted upon their desire to become human by harvesting organs.'
rupert_giles Emily's heart.
willow_rosenberg Morgan's dummy.
rupert_giles Mm.
xander_harris Whoa!
rupert_giles What is it?
xander_harris He's gone! Sid's gone!
rupert_giles What? Oh!
willow_rosenberg Uhhh!
buffy_summers Morgan?
buffy_summers Morgan! Demon's got himself a brain.
buffy_summers Who's ever out there, I'm gonna hurt you! Badly! If you'll just gimme a minute...
sid You win. Now you can take your heart and your brain and move on.
buffy_summers I'm sure they would have made great trophies for your case.
sid That woulda been justice.
buffy_summers Yeah, except for one thing: you lost, and now you'll never be human.
sid Yeah, well, neither will you.
Buffy_and_Sid#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode09 What?
sid This is what I do. I hunt demons. Yeah, you wouldn't know it to look at me. Let's just say there was me, there was a really mean demon, there was a curse, and the next thing I know I'm not me anymore. I'm sitting on some guy's knee, with his hand up my shirt.
willow_rosenberg And ever since then you've been a living dummy?
sid The kid here was right all along. I shoulda picked you to team up with. But I didn't because...
buffy_summers Because you thought *I* was the demon.
sid Who can blame me for thinking? Look at you! You're strong, athletic, limber... nubile... I'm back! In any case, now that this demon's got the heart and brain, he gets to keep the human form he's in for another seven years.
rupert_giles I must say, it's a welcome change to have someone else explain all these things.
sid There were seven of these guys. I've killed six. If I can get the last one, the curse will be lifted and I'll be free. I'm sure it's someone in that stupid talent show.
buffy_summers Yeah, but now that demon has what he wants. He'll be moving on.
sid So, once we know who's missing from the show...
buffy_summers We'll know who our demon is!
rupert_giles The show!
buffy_summers What?
rupert_giles It's gonna start! I'm supposed to be there!
buffy_summers Okay, um, start pulling everyone's addresses in the talent show. I-if they're not there, maybe we can catch them at home.
sid And you, get 'em all on stage, form the power circle. Then we can see who's a no-show.
rupert_giles Um, uh, the what?
sid The power circle. You get everyone together, you get 'em, you know, revved up.
rupert_giles Right.
sid How'd *he* ever get that gig?
rupert_giles Fifteen minutes to curtain, everyone! Uh, fifteen minutes!
cordelia_chase I, I can't go out there. All those people staring at me and judging me like I'm some kind of... Buffy! What if I mess up?
rupert_giles Cordelia, there, uh, there-there's, uh, uh, an adage, uh, that, uh, if you're feeling nervous then, uh, you should imagine the entire audience are in their underwear.
cordelia_chase Eww! Even Mrs. Franklin? Uhhh!
rupert_giles Perhaps not.
cordelia_chase Yeah.
rupert_giles Um, alright, um, we'll assemble on the stage in five minutes for the, um, uh, power thing.
sid So, what's your deal, kid? I don't figure you for a demon hunter.
buffy_summers I'm a Vampire Slayer.
sid You?! You're the Slayer? Damn! I knew a Slayer in the 30's. Korean chick. Very hot. We're talking *muscle* tone. Man, we had some times. Hey, that was pre-dummy, alright? Now, I was a guy!
buffy_summers So, you kill the demon and the curse is lifted, right?
sid That's the drill.
buffy_summers You don't actually turn into a prince, do you? I-I mean, your body...
sid Is dust and bones. When I say free...
buffy_summers You mean dead.
sid Don't get sniffly on me, sis. I've lived a lot longer than most demon hunters. Or Slayers, for that matter.
sid Of course, if you want to snuggle up and comfort me...
buffy_summers So, that horny dummy thing really *isn't* an act, is it?
sid Nope!
buffy_summers Yuk!
rupert_giles I-is everybody here?
sid Okay, here comes our line-up.
rupert_giles Quickly, everyone! Uh... um, power circle.
rupert_giles Well, that's that, then. Um, everybody, uh, get ready!
buffy_summers Hold on.
rupert_giles No one's missing.
buffy_summers So the demon isn't in the show.
rupert_giles It seems not. Uh, tell the others. Look, it's nearly curtain. I must get the show rolling.
buffy_summers Right.
rupert_giles Right.
buffy_summers Sid?
buffy_summers Sid?
buffy_summers I'm never gonna stop washing my hands.
xander_harris So, the dummy tells us that he's a demon hunter. And we're, like, fine, la la la la. He takes off, and now there's a brain. Does anybody else feel like they've been Keyser Soze'd?
buffy_summers Sid's on the level, I'm sure of it. But why would the demon have rejected the brain? I-I mean, I thought Morgan was the smartest kid in school.
willow_rosenberg He was, look at his grades: all A's. He was even taking college classes. Wait a second.
buffy_summers What?
willow_rosenberg All these sick days.
xander_harris He was off for, like, half the year!
buffy_summers Check the school nurse's file.
willow_rosenberg Look at this! 'In case of emergency, contact Dr. Dale Leggett, California Institute of Neurosurgery, Cancer Ward.'
xander_harris Brain cancer?
willow_rosenberg That's why he had all the headaches.
buffy_summers This means that whatever's out there still needs a healthy, intelligent brain.
xander_harris In other words, I'm safe!
buffy_summers And it's gonna be looking for the smartest person around.
willow_rosenberg What?
rupert_giles Yes, if you, you calibrated the units of weight then you could calculate the, uh, specific maximum velocity achieved before the point of impact.
marc Gee, Mr. Giles, you're really... smart! Could you do me a favor?
willow_rosenberg What could a demon possibly want from me?
xander_harris What's the square root of 841?
willow_rosenberg 29. Oh, yeah.
buffy_summers Don't worry, Willow. As long as you're with us there's absolutely no way that demon is gonna get what he wants.
rupert_giles Oh, my!
marc Pretty cool, huh?
rupert_giles Are you sure there's no one else who could help you out?
marc My assistant got sick. You won't have to say anything. I'll, I'll show you. Lie down.
rupert_giles Uh, uh, how, how exactly does it work?
marc A good magician never tells his secrets.
marc C'mon. We haven't got much time.
buffy_summers This is ridiculous. We can't just sit here and wait for him to come to us. We have to figure out who we're dealing with.
xander_harris I still vote dummy.
buffy_summers No. Okay, so we ruled out all the people in the talent show...
willow_rosenberg That's because they were all there. But that's before we found the brain.
buffy_summers Right. So it probably *is* one of them. And, and Giles doesn't know! He's with them all right now!
xander_harris Uch! Giles can handle himself. I mean, he *is* really... smart!
buffy_summers GILES!
rupert_giles Sh-sh-shouldn't it be aimed at my neck?
marc No. No, this way your scalp gets sliced off and your brains just... come pouring out.
rupert_giles What exactly is the trick?
marc Trick?
rupert_giles Marc?
rupert_giles M-Marc?
buffy_summers Ewww!
willow_rosenberg Where are the keys?
rupert_giles Marc's got it!
xander_harris Willow!
rupert_giles Hurry!
buffy_summers How do you lock this thing?
rupert_giles What's happening?
sid I found you!
buffy_summers Let go!
rupert_giles Uh... I must say, all of you... Your t-timing is impeccable.
sid And now for the big finish.
buffy_summers What are you doing?
sid It's not enough. He'll come back. You have to get the heart. Then all of this'll be over.
buffy_summers Let me.
sid I got it. Thanks.
buffy_summers It's over.
principal_snyder I don't get it. What is it? Avant-garde?
willow_rosenberg Oh, ruler of my country, Oedipus, you see our company around the Altar, and I, the priest of Zeus!
xander_harris Ha, ha! They prophesize that I should kill my father. But he is dead. And hidden deep in the soil. But surely I must fear my mother's bed.
buffy_summers Oh, Oedipus, Oedipus, unhappy Oedipus, that is all I can call you, and all that I ever shall call you.
xander_harris Darkness! And horror of darkness. Unfolding, restless, visitant, sped by an ill wind in haste.
xander_harris Madness, and... Madness a-and stabbing pain, and, a-and, uh... oh... oh... memory of, uh, i-ill deeds I have done.

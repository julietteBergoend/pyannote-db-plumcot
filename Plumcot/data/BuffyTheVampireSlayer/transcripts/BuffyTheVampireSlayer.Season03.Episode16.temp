D'Hoffryn Do not ask again.
Anya But... But I...
D'Hoffryn Your powers were a gift of the lower beings. You have proved unworthy of them.
Anya I was robbed of them.
D'Hoffryn By your carelessness.
Anya For a thousand years I wielded the powers of The Wish. I brought ruin to the heads of unfaithful men. I brought forth destruction and chaos for the pleasure of the lower beings. I was feared and worshipped across the mortal globe. And now I'm stuck at Sunnydale High. Mortal. Child. And I'm flunking math.
D'Hoffryn This is no concern of ours. You will live out your mortal life and die.
Anya Give me another chance. You can fold the fabric of time. Send me back to that place and I'll change it. I won't fail again.
D'Hoffryn Your time is passed.
Anya Do you have any idea how boring twelfth graders are? I'm getting my power center back. And if you won't help me, then, by the pestilent gods, I will find someone who will!
Buffy The Watcher Council shrink is heavy into tests. He's got tests for everything. T.A.T.s, Rorschach, associative logic... He even has that test to see if you're crazy that asks if you ever hear voices or you ever wanted to be a florist.
Willow Ooo, I used to want... Wait. Florist means crazy, right? I never wanted to do that.
Buffy Neat.
Willow Thanks. It's all about emotional control. Plus, obviously, magic. Hey, you wanna go to the Espresso Pump and get sugared up on mochas?
Buffy I'm gonna pass. Hit the pool and do some laps.
Willow How come the sudden calisthenics? Aren't you sort of naturally buff, Buff? Buff buff.
Buffy Well, they've got us running around on the physical side, too. A lot of reflex evaluation and precision training, you know. I-I just... Well, I-I wanna do...
Willow Better than Faith?
Buffy So very shallow.
Willow Competition is natural and healthy. Plus, you'll definitely ace her on the psych tests. Just don't mark the box that says, 'I sometimes like to kill people.'
Buffy I know Faith's not gonna be on the cover of Sanity Fair, but... she had it rough. Different circumstances, that could be me.
Willow No way. Some people just don't have that in them.
Buffy Look, I'm sorry. I-I know how you hate talking about Faith.
Willow No, it's okay.
Buffy No, really, we should just...
Willow No. I-it doesn't bother me. I mean it.
Buffy Uh, Will?
Willow Oh.
Buffy Emotional control?
Willow I'm working on it.
Snyder As far as I'm concerned, this is a marriage made in heaven. Willow Rosenberg, despite her unsavory associations, represents the pinnacle of academic achievement at Sunnydale High. Percy West represents a devastating fast break and 50% from behind the three-point line.
Willow I-I'm not sure I understand the marriage part.
Snyder You've got the brains, he's got the fast break. It's a perfect match.
Willow Match? You want us to breed?
Snyder I want you to tutor him. Percy is flunking history. Nothing seems to be able to motivate him.
Percy Hey, I'm *challenged*.
Snyder You're lazy, self-involved and spoiled. That's quite the challenge. But we need a winning year, especially after last year's debacle with the swim team. Can't have our point guard benched. So, you're gonna take on a little teaching job. I know how you enjoy teaching.
Willow Well, I have a lot of work of my own.
Snyder You've got a letter of acceptance from every university with a stamp.
Willow Y-yes, but I still have classes and I don't...
Snyder Rosenberg, it's time to give something back to the community. I know you wanna help your school out here. Ask me how I know.
Willow How do you...?
Snyder I just... know.
Buffy So he threatened you? With what?
Willow Well, i-it wasn't exactly anything he said. It was all in his eyes. I mean, there was some nostril work as well, but mostly eyes.
Buffy Snyder needs me to kick his ass.
Willow Oh, no, Buffy, don't get in trouble. I'll be okay.
Willow I just hate the way he bullies people. He just assumes everyone's time is his.
Giles Willow, get on the computer. I want you to take another pass at accessing the Mayor's files.
Willow Okay.
Faith Well, that was a blast.
Giles How did it go?
Faith Princess Margaret here had a little trouble keeping up.
Giles How did it go?
Wesley Faith, uh... did quite well on the obstacle field. Still a little sloppy, though.
Giles Do you feel up to, uh, taking Buffy out, or shall I?
Wesley Oh, no, no, no. I'll be fine. Just give me a minute. And some defibrillators, if it's not too much trouble.
Faith You're gonna love it, B. It's just like fun, only boring.
Giles Faith, this evaluation is a necessary part of the Council's...
Faith I know. I'm on board here. Just shooting my mouth off.
Buffy I better change.
Faith Good luck.
Faith What cha doin'?
Willow I'm trying to access the Mayor's personal files.
Faith Can you do that?
Willow Well, he's got some tricky barriers set up.
Faith Can you get past 'em?
Willow Eventually I'll get through.
Mayor_Wilkins That's very interesting.
Faith Yeah, I thought so, too. Are you serious about this place?
Mayor_Wilkins Of course I am. No Slayer of *mine* is gonna live in a fleabag hotel. That place has a very unsavory reputation. There are immoral liaisons going on there.
Faith Yeah, plus all the screwing. This place is the kick!
Mayor_Wilkins We'll keep your old place, in case you need to see your friends there, but from now on...
Mayor_Wilkins Oh, hey, hey, hey! Shoes! Shoes!
Faith Thanks, Sugar Daddy.
Mayor_Wilkins Now, Faith, I don't find that sort of thing amusing. I'm a family man.
Mayor_Wilkins Now, let's kill your little friend.
Mayor_Wilkins Don't worry. I wouldn't ask you to do it. Not this early in the relationship. Besides, I think a vampire attack would be less suspicious anyway. In the meantime, let's take a look at the rest of the apartment, huh? If I'm not mistaken, some lucky girl has herself a PlayStation.
Faith No way.
Mayor_Wilkins Yes way!
Oz Hey!
Willow Oz! Hi!
Oz There's something about you that's causing me to hug you. It's like I have no will of my own.
Willow Where were you yesterday?
Oz Mm... We got back late, sort of very.
Willow We? Who? Where?
Oz The band. We had a gig in Monterey Sunday night.
Willow Oh, you did? How come I didn't know?
Oz I thought you did.
Willow Maybe I would have liked to go.
Oz Didn't figure you for missing school.
Willow You think I'm boring.
Oz I'd call that a radical interpretation of the text. We're playing tonight at the Bronze.
Willow I can't. I have too much homework.
Oz If you get done early...
Willow Percy! Hey. Listen, I thought we could get together today at lunch and go over your Roosevelt paper. You know, what books you'll need and stuff.
Percy What are you talking about?
Willow Me tutoring you. Your, your history paper?
Percy Oh, yeah, yeah. Snyder said *you* were gonna do it.
Willow He never said that.
Percy What meeting were *you* at?
Willow Look, I-I'll get the books you need. Just meet me at lunch and...
Percy No, no, no. I don't have any time at lunch. I gotta hang out.
Willow Well...
Percy What, what, you got something better to do? Just type it up and put my name on it. Oh, and don't type too good. Dead giveaway.
Willow I'm eating this now. It's not lunchtime, I don't even care.
Buffy Hey.
Xander Willow, did you remember to tape Biography last Friday?
Willow Uh-huh.
Buffy See, I told you. Old Reliable.
Willow Oh, thanks.
Buffy What?
Willow 'Old Reliable'? Yeah, great. *There's* a sexy nickname.
Buffy Well, I-I didn't mean it as...
Willow No, it's fine. I'm 'Old Reliable'.
Xander She just means, you know, the geyser. You're like a geyser of fun that goes off at regular intervals.
Willow That's Old Faithful.
Xander Isn't that the dog that, that the guy had to shoot...
Willow That's Old Yeller.
Buffy Xander, I beg you not to help me. Will, I-I didn't mean it as a bad thing. I-I think it's good to be reliable.
Willow Well, maybe I don't *wanna* be reliable all the time. Maybe I'm not just some doormat person. Homework Gal.
Xander I'm thinking nerve strike.
Willow Maybe I'll change my look! Or cut class. You don't know.
Willow And I'm eating this banana. Lunchtime be damned!
Buffy Will, wait. I'm really sorry...
Willow Buff, I'm storming off. It doesn't really work if you come with me.
Buffy Oh.
Anya Uh, Willow?
Willow Uh, hi.
Anya Anya. I'm sort of new here. Um, I know Cordelia?
Willow Oh, fun.
Anya Yeah. Um, listen, I have this little project I'm working on, and I heard you were the person to ask if...
Willow Yeah, that's me. Reliable-Dog-Geyser Person. What do you need?
Anya Oh, it's nothing big. Just a little spell I'm working on.
Willow A spell? Oh. I like the black arts.
Anya I just need a secondary to create a temporal fold. I heard you were a pretty powerful wicca, so...
Willow You heard right, mister! I-I-I'm always ready to work some dark mojo. So, tell me, is it dangerous?
Anya Oh, no.
Willow Well, could we pretend it is?
Anya The necklace was a family heirloom passed down for generations. Then it was stolen from my mom's apartment.
Willow How does the spell work?
Anya Uh, well, we both call on Eryishon, the Endless One, offer up the standard supplication, then there's a teensy temporal fold. We hope. Um, then I pour the sacred sand on the representation of the necklace, and Eryishon brings it forth from the time and place it was lost.
Willow Cool.
Anya Are we ready?
Willow I think so.
Anya Eryishon. K'shala. Meh-uhn.
Willow Diprecht. Doh-tehenlo nu-Eryishon.
Anya The child to the mother.
Willow The river to the sea.
Anya Eryishon, hear my prayer.
Willow That was... W-w-what was that?
Anya Oh, it's not here. It's not here!
Willow Okay, that's a little blacker than I like my arts.
Anya Oh, don't be such a wimp.
Willow That, that-that wasn't just some temporal fold, that was some weird Hell place. I-I don't think you're telling me everything.
Anya I swear, I am just trying to find my necklace.
Willow Well, did you try looking inside the sofa *in Hell*?
Anya Look, we'll just try it again, and...
Willow No! I-I think emphatically not!
Anya I can't do it by myself!
Willow That's a relief. I'm outta here.
Anya Fine! Go! Idiot child.
Willow I believe these chicken feet are mine. Look, m-magic is dangerous, Anya, i-it's, it's not to be toyed with. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have someone else's homework to do.
Anya Nothing!
Evil_Willow This is weird.
Old_woman E-e-excuse me, young lady...
Percy Hey! Rosenberg? What are you doing, trick-or-treating? You're supposed to be at home doing my history report. I flunk that class, you're in big trouble with Snyder. Till we graduate, I own your ass.
Evil_Willow Bored now.
Guy#1 Whoa, whoa, whoa, man!
Guy#2 Hey!
Guy#1 What's up with *that*, man?
Guy#3 What the heck?
Evil_Willow I'm having a terrible night.
Evil_Willow Wanna make it better?
Guy#4 Check it out!
Xander What's going on? Is there a funny thing?
Xander Back off! You stay the hell away from her!
Percy Okay! Sure!
Evil_Willow Xander!
Xander Will, changing the look not an idle threat with you.
Evil_Willow You're alive!
Xander Uh... Will, this is verging on naughty touching here. Don't wanna fall back on bad habits. Hands! Hands in new places!
Evil_Willow You're alive.
Xander You mentioned that before. Will, are you okay?
Evil_Willow No! Everything's different.
Buffy Oh. There you are.
Xander Hey, Buff.
Buffy Aren't you gonna introduce me to your... Holy *God*, you're Willow.
Evil_Willow You.
Buffy You know what? I, I like the look. It's, um... it's, it's extreme, but it, it, it looks good, you know, it's a leather thing, and, uh... I said extreme already, right?
Evil_Willow I don't like you.
Buffy Will, I'm sorry about today. You know how my foot likes to live in my mouth. But you know... y-you really didn't have to prove anything.
Evil_Willow Leaving now.
Xander Will, gotta say, not lovin' the new you.
Buffy Will, wait...
Evil_Willow Get off me!
Alfonse Willow Rosenberg.
Evil_Willow I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
Alfonse Then we won't talk.
Evil_Willow You made me cranky.
Alfonse There's been a mistake here. We were sent after a human.
Evil_Willow Really? Who do you work for?
Alfonse I'm not telling you a thing.
Evil_Willow Who do you work for?
Alfonse Wilkins. The Mayor.
Evil_Willow *Who* do you work for?
Alfonse You.
Evil_Willow Get your friends. Bring them here. The world's no fun anymore. We're gonna make it the way it was. Starting with the Bronze.
Giles Oh, Buffy. I thought you were going out tonight. I didn't expect...
Giles What is it?
Xander This isn't real.
Buffy I can't feel anything. Arms, legs, anything.
Giles She was truly the finest of all of us.
Xander Way better than me.
Giles Much, much better.
Xander It's all my fault.
Buffy No, it's me. I-it's me. I'm the one that called her reliable. She must have gone out and gotten attacked, which she never would have done if I hadn't have called her reliable. And now my best friend is...
Willow What's going on?
Willow Jeez, who died?
Willow Oh, God! Who died?
Xander Back! Get back, demon!
Buffy Willow, you're alive?
Willow Aren't I usually?
Buffy Oh!
Willow I love you guys, too?
Willow Okay. Oxygen becoming an issue.
Willow Giles, what's going on with these...
Willow Oh!
Giles Oh. Sorry.
Willow It's really nice that you guys missed me. Say, you all didn't happen to do a bunch of drugs, did ya?
Xander Will, we saw you at the Bronze. A vampire.
Willow I'm not a *vampire*.
Buffy You are. I-I mean, you, you were. Giles, planning on jumping in with an explanation any time soon?
Giles Well, uh... something... something, um, very strange is happening.
Xander Can you believe the Watcher's Council let this guy go?
Anya What a day. Gimme a beer.
Bartender I.D.
Bartender I.D.
Anya I'm eleven hundred and twenty years old! Just gimme a friggin' beer!
Bartender I.D.
Anya Gimme a Coke.
Devon Man, we need a roadie. Other bands have roadies.
Oz Well, other bands know more than three chords. Your professional bands can play up to six, sometimes seven *completely* different chords.
Devon That's just, like, fruity jazz bands.
Angel Oz.
Oz Hey, man. You looking for Buffy?
Angel As always.
Oz Well, no sightings as of yet, but I think she said she'd show.
Oz That doesn't look good.
Alfonse EVERYBODY, SHUT UP!
Alfonse Alright. Nobody cause any trouble or try to leave... and nobody gets hurt.
Angel Why don't I believe him?
Oz Well, he lacks credibility.
Oz Can you get outta here?
Angel Skylight in the roof. I can make it.
Oz I think we need some backup.
Angel I think I'm needed here.
Oz Ten to one. Could get pointless.
Evil_Willow Look. Everyone's all afraid. It's just like old times.
Oz Get Buffy. Do it now.
Devon Dude, check out your girlfriend.
Evil_Willow What's your name?
Sandy Sandy.
Evil_Willow You don't have to be afraid... just to please me. If you're all good boys and girls, we'll make you young and strong forever and ever.
Evil_Willow We'll have fun.
Evil_Willow If you're not...
Devon No, man!
Evil_Willow Questions? Comments?
Oz Willow. You don't wanna do this.
Evil_Willow I don't? But I'm so good at it.
Oz Who *did* this to you?
Evil_Willow I know you. You're a White Hat. How come you're talking to me like we're friends?
Anya 'Cause he thinks you're someone else. He thinks you're the Willow that belongs in *this* reality.
Evil_Willow Another me?
Anya You know this isn't your world, right? I mean, you know you don't belong here.
Evil_Willow No. This is a dumb world. In my world there are people in chains, and we can ride them like ponies.
Anya You wanna get back there.
Evil_Willow Yeah.
Anya So do I.
Willow This is creepy. I don't like the thought that there's a vampire out there that looks like me.
Xander Not looks like. Is.
Buffy It was exactly you, Will, every detail. Except for your not being a dominatrix. As far as we know.
Willow Oh, right. Me and Oz play 'Mistress of Pain' every night.
Xander Did anyone else just go to a scary visual place?
Buffy Oh, yeah.
Angel Buffy, I... I just... Something's happened that...
Angel Willow's dead.
Angel Hey, Willow.
Angel Wait a second.
Xander We're *right* there with you, buddy.
Buffy We saw her, too, at the Bronze.
Angel Okay. She's there now with a cadre of vampires looking to party.
Buffy We can figure out who she is *after* we stop the feeding frenzy.
Buffy How many of them were there?
Angel Eight or ten.
Buffy Should we call Faith?
Giles No, I don't want her in combat yet. Not around civilians.
Xander Hear, hear.
Willow Guys? What are we gonna do with me? The... other... me?
Buffy I don't know, Will. I mean, we just have to stop them.
Willow I-I get that. I just kind of wanted to know... Oh! Hey, uh, go. I-I'll catch up.
Evil_Willow Alone at last.
Evil_Willow Well, look at me. I'm all fuzzy.
Willow What do I want with you? Uh...
Evil_Willow Your little school friend Anya said that you're the one that brought me here. She said that you could get me back to my world.
Willow Oh. Oh! Oops!
Evil_Willow But I don't know... I kinda *like* the idea of the two of us.
Evil_Willow We could be quite a team, if you came around to *my* way of thinking.
Willow Would that mean we have to snuggle?
Evil_Willow What do you say?
Evil_Willow Wanna be bad?
Willow This just can't get more disturbing.
Willow Ack! Ew! No more! You're really starting to freak me out!
Willow Ow!
Evil_Willow You don't wanna play, I guess I can't force you.
Evil_Willow Oh, wait.
Evil_Willow I can.
Evil_Willow Bitch...
Giles It's extraordinary.
Willow It's horrible! That's me as a vampire? I'm so evil and... skanky. And I think I'm kinda gay.
Buffy Willow, just remember, a vampire's personality has nothing to do with the person it was.
Angel Well, actually... That's a good point.
Xander So, uh, what do we do now?
Giles We still have to get to the Bronze.
Angel Well, even if they're supposed to wait for her they may start feeding. Vampires are not notoriously reliable.
Xander So we charge in, much in the style of John Wayne?
Giles High casualty risk. I haven't any other plan, though.
Buffy Uh, I have a really bad idea.
Angel They're still in a holding pattern. That's good. It means they must really be afraid of you.
Willow Who wouldn't be?
Buffy Are you okay in that?
Willow It's a little binding. I guess vampires really don't have to breathe. Gosh, look at those.
Giles Um, ahem, Willow, you, uh, you go in and defuse the situation as best you can. At least try and get some of them to come out and even up the odds a bit.
Buffy First sign of trouble, you give us a signal. We come in hard and fast.
Xander What *is* the signal?
Willow Me screaming.
Angel Giles, you and Xander wait by the back entrance.
Giles Good.
Buffy Now, you're sure you're up to this?
Willow Don't worry. I won't do anything that could be interpreted as brave.
Buffy We'll be right outside.
Willow Hi. I'm back.
Alfonse Did you find the girl?
Willow Yep. I did.
Anya Where is she?
Willow I killed her.
Willow And sucked her blood, as we vampires do.
Willow You know, I think maybe I heard something out there. Why don't you go check?
Anya H-how could you kill her? She was our best shot at getting your world back.
Willow I don't like that you dare question me.
Willow Maybe I'll have my minions take you out back and kill you horribly.
Anya Vampires. Always thinking with your teeth.
Willow She bothered me. She's so weak and accommodating. She's always letting people walk all over her, and then she gets cranky with her friends for no reason. I just *couldn't* let her live.
Willow You know, he's been gone for a while. Why don't you go check on him?
Alfonse Well, Boss, since that plan is out, why don't we get with the killing?
Evil_Willow Oh, this is like a nightmare.
Cordelia Hello? Giles?
Cordelia Wesley? I just happened to stop by... for books.
Evil_Willow Hey, you.
Cordelia 'Hey me'? 'Hey me' what? I have a name, you know.
Evil_Willow Uh, Cordelia.
Cordelia What did you do? Lock yourself in the book cage?
Evil_Willow Yeah. Lemme out... 'Cause I'm so helpless.
Cordelia Okay.
Cordelia I think Giles keeps a spare. How'd you manage to lock yourself in, anyway?
Evil_Willow Uh, I was looking at books. I like... books...
Evil_Willow ...'cause I'm shy.
Cordelia Yeah, right. The famous shy girl act all the boys fall for.
Evil_Willow Open the cage.
Cordelia Wait. It occurs to me that we've never really had the opportunity to talk. You know, woman to woman... with you locked up.
Evil_Willow Don't wanna talk. Hungry.
Cordelia What could we talk about? Oh! Hey! How about the ethics of boyfriend stealing?
Willow I don't know if I feel like killing anymore.
Willow I'm so bored.
Willow I-it would be like shooting fish in a barrel. Where's the fun?
Alfonse With all due respect, Boss, the fun would be the eating.
Willow Maybe we should let everyone go, and give them a thirty second head start.
Anya Wait a minute.
Willow No! I *like* my plan.
Anya Oh, nice try.
Willow Okay, let's get to the killing. Why don't we start with her?
Anya Why don't we start with you? If she's a vampire, then I'm the creature from the black lagoon.
Cordelia And, okay, it isn't even like I was that attracted to Xander. It was more just that we kept being put in these life or death situations, and that's always all sexy and stuff.
Cordelia I mean, I more or less knew he was a loser. But that doesn't make it okay for you to come around and... What? Do I have something on my neck?
Evil_Willow Not yet.
Cordelia Am I getting a zit?
Evil_Willow Cordelia, I'm *very* sorry. I realize I was wrong. I'll never steal your boyfriend again.
Cordelia Like you could! I should just leave you in there, but I'm a great humanitarian, and you will just have to think of a way to pay me back sometime.
Evil_Willow Okay. How about dinner?
Cordelia I didn't mean all that stuff I said before. I want you to have Xander. My blessings on you both!
Evil_Willow I'm *so* over him. I need fresh blood.
Evil_Willow No more hiding.
Wesley Back! Creature of the night!
Wesley Leave this place!
Evil_Willow Don't wanna.
Evil_Willow Whatever.
Cordelia I'm sorry.
Wesley No, no. A little on edge. You know, men in combat. Grr. Are you all right?
Cordelia You saved my life. Thank you!
Wesley Oh, yes. Uh... Yes.
Wesley Was that...?
Cordelia Willow. They got Willow. So, are you doing anything tonight?
Anya I'm just so tired of being around human beings and all their baggage. I-I don't care if I ever get my powers back.
Anya I think he should eat you.
Willow This girl has a history of mental problems dating back to early childhood. I'm a blood-sucking fiend! Look at my outfit!
Alfonse A human. I should have smelled it right away.
Willow A human? Oh, yeah? Could a human do this?
Anya Sure. Yeah. Humans do that. Yeah.
Alfonse Yeah. Yeah, I think, yeah.
Willow Ow! Ow! Ow! Happy, but ow!
Oz Devon, come on!
Willow No more snuggles?
Willow BUFFY, NO!
Willow Nice reflexes.
Buffy Well, I work out.
Evil_Willow This world's no fun.
Willow You noticed that, too?
Xander So, um, in your reality, I'm like this bad-ass vampire, huh? People afraid of me?
Xander Oh, yeah. I'm bad.
Buffy I'm not sure about releasing this thing into the wild, Will. It is a demon.
Willow I just can't kill her.
Buffy No. Me, neither.
Willow I mean, I know she's not me. We have a big nothing in common, but... still.
Buffy There but for the grace of getting bit.
Willow We send her back to her world, and she stands a chance. It's the way it should be anyway.
Giles Uh, we're about ready here.
Giles Don't you try any tricks now, dear.
Anya I don't need tricks. When I get my powers back, you will all grovel before me.
Giles Yes, uh, if you, uh, Willows, would like to, uh, complete the circle.
Willow Good luck. Try not to kill people.
Willow Hands! Hands!
Evil_Willow Aw, f...
Buffy You wanna go out tonight?
Willow Strangely, I feel like staying at home... and doing my homework... and flossing... and dying a virgin.
Buffy You know, you can O.D. on virtue.
Willow Between me and my evil self, I've got double guilt coupons. I see now where the path of vice leads. I mean, she messed up everything she touched. I don't ever want to be like that.
Percy Hey. Uh, hi.
Willow Oh, hi. Listen, I didn't have a chance...
Percy Okay, so I did the outline for the paper on Roosevelt. It turns out there were two President Roosevelts, so I didn't know exactly which one to do, so I did both.
Percy Um, and I know they're kinda, kinda short, but I can flesh them out. Oh, and here's the bibliography. Um, and I can retype that if you want. You just let me know what I did wrong, and I'll get on it.
Buffy You wanna go out tonight?
Willow 9:00 sound good?

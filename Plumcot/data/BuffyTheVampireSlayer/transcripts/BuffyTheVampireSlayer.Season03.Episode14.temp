Faith So, what, you're telling me never?!
Buffy Faith! Really, now is not the time!
Faith I'm curious! Never ever?!
Faith Come on, really. All this time, and not even once?
Buffy How many times do I have to say it?
Buffy I have never...
Buffy ...done it...
Buffy ...with Xander!
Buffy He's just a friend.
Faith So? What are friends for? I mean, I'm sorry, it's just, all this sweating-nightly, side-by-side action, and you never put in for a little after-hours?
Buffy Thanks for the poetry. And, no. I love Xander. I just don't... *love* Xander. Besides, I think it ruins friendship to do that stuff.
Faith You think too much.
Buffy Hey. There's one more.
Faith How do you know?
Buffy I think too much.
Buffy Okay. Count of three. One...
Buffy Three.
Faith Nicely diverted, B!
Buffy Diverted? That was me fighting for my life, Miss Attention Span.
Faith This isn't a Tupperware Party. It's a little hard to plan.
Buffy The count of three isn't a plan. It's Sesame Street.
Faith Hey, they're toast and we're here, so it couldn't have been too bad, right? Who were those guys, anyways?
Buffy I don't know. They didn't seem local. Look, why don't we grab the weapons. Maybe Giles...
Trick Check these out.
Mayor_Wilkins I, I just love the Family Circus! That P.J., he's getting to be quite a handful.
Mayor_Wilkins Well... I haven't seen anything like this in, uh... Well, a good long while. Where's the owner of these fine implements?
Trick The common term is 'slain'. But I've been seeing this breed around. Are we expecting any trouble?
Mayor_Wilkins Do you like Family Circus?
Trick I like Marmaduke.
Mayor_Wilkins Oh! Eww! He's always on the furniture. Unsanitary.
Trick Nobody can tell Marmaduke what to do. That's my kinda dog.
Allan I like to read Cathy.
Allan So, uh, what ab-bout these swords? W-what should we do about that?
Mayor_Wilkins Well, let's just keep an eye out. We've got the dedication coming up in a few days. We certainly can't have anything interfering with that.
Allan Well, maybe we should postpone the... the-the dedication.
Trick I believe the Honorable Mayor *hates* that idea.
Mayor_Wilkins The dedication... is the final step before my Ascension. I have waited longer than you can imagine for this. After the Hundred Days, I'll be on a higher plane. And I'll have no more need for... Well, let's just say I won't be concerned... with the little things. Mr. Trick, watch these people. Anything you find out about them, well, let's just see that that information reaches the Slayers. Who knows? With any luck, they'll kill each other. Then everyone's a winner. Everyone, of course, meaning me.
Xander Willow, what are these?
Willow They're early admission packets.
Xander Harvard... Yale... Wesleyan... Some German Polytechnical Institute whose name I, uh... I can't pronounce. Is anyone else intimidated? 'Cause I'm just expecting thin slips of paper with the words 'No Way' written in crayon.
Oz They're typing those now.
Xander Hmm.
Willow I'm so overwhelmed! I-I got in! To actual colleges! And, a-and they're wooing me! They're pitching woo!
Buffy The wooing stage is always fun.
Willow But it's weird. Now, rejection I can handle 'cause of the years of training, but this...
Xander I feel your pain, Will. Like right now, I'm torn between the fast-growing fields of appliance repair and motel management. Of course, I'm still waiting to hear back from the, uh, Corndog Emporium, so...
Buffy Well, I think it's great. Early admission. Now there's nothing standing between you and a brilliant future.
Oz Well, if I may suggest, graduate. Gettin' left back: not the thrill ride you'd expect.
Cordelia That's so cute! Planning life as a loser? Most people just turn out that way, but you're really taking charge.
Xander The comedy stylings of Miss Cordelia Chase, everyone. Who, uh, incidentally, won't be needing a higher education when she markets her own very successful line of hooker wear.
Cordelia Well, Xander, I could dress more like you, but, oh, my father has a job.
Xander I'm not gonna waste the perfect comeback on you now. But don't think I don't have it. Oh, yes! Its time will come!
Xander So, life beyond high school. Anyone, please... chime in.
Buffy I hear it's nice. And a place I'll never go if I don't pass Mrs. Taggart's chemistry test tomorrow.
Willow Oh! I can help. Chemistry's easy. It's a lot like witchcraft, only less newt. So whadaya say? Study jam, my house, tonight?
Buffy I'm there.
Buffy Oh. I have to go see Giles, report on last night's patrol.
Willow Oh, yeah. He said he wanted to talk to you.
Buffy What about? Is he okay?
Willow He's looked better.
Wesley Of course, training procedures have been updated quite a bit since your day. Much greater emphasis on field work.
Giles Really?
Wesley Oh, yes. Not all books and theory nowadays. I have, in fact, faced two vampires myself. Under controlled circumstances, of course.
Giles Well, no danger of finding those here.
Wesley Vampires?
Giles Controlled circumstances. Hello, Buffy.
Wesley Well... Hello.
Buffy New Watcher?
Giles New Watcher.
Wesley Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.
Wesley It's very nice to meet you.
Buffy Is he evil?
Wesley Evil?
Buffy The last one was evil.
Wesley Oh, yes. Gwendolyn Post. We all heard. No. Mr. Giles has checked my credentials rather thoroughly and phoned the Council, but I'm glad to see you're on the ball as well. A good Slayer is a cautious Slayer.
Buffy Is he evil?
Giles Not in the strictest sense.
Wesley Well, I'm glad that's cleared up. As I'm sure none of us is anxious to waste any time on pleasantries, why don't you tell me everything about last night's patrol.
Buffy Vampires.
Wesley Yes?
Buffy Killed 'em.
Wesley Anything else you can tell me?
Buffy Uh... One of them had swords. I don't think he was with the other two.
Wesley Swords?
Wesley Swords...
Wesley One long, one short?
Buffy Mmm. Both pointy. With, like, jewels and things.
Giles Sounds familiar.
Wesley It should.
Giles El Eliminati. Fifteenth Century...
Wesley Fifteenth Century duelist cult, deadly in their day. Their numbers dwindled in later centuries due to an increase in anti-vampire activity and a lot of pointless dueling.
Wesley They eventually became the acolytes of a demon called Balthazar, who brought them to the New World, specifically here.
Giles You seem to know a lot about them.
Wesley I didn't get this job because of my looks.
Buffy I really, really believe that.
Wesley I've researched this town's history extensively.
Giles So why have we not seen them before this?
Wesley They were driven out a hundred years ago. Happily, Balthazar was killed. I don't know by whom.
Buffy And they're back 'cause...?
Wesley Balthazar had an amulet purported to give him strength. When he was killed, it was taken by a wealthy landowner named... I don't want to bore you with the details.
Buffy A little bit late.
Wesley ...named Gleaves. It was buried with him, and I believe the few remaining Eliminati are probably looking for it. For sentimental value.
Giles A-and you don't think that this, uh, amulet poses any threat?
Wesley Oh, no, not at all. Nonetheless, we may as well keep it from them. Buffy, you will go to the Gleaves family crypt tonight and fetch the amulet.
Buffy I will?
Wesley Are you not used to being given orders?
Buffy Whenever Giles sends me on a mission, he always says 'please'. And afterwards I get a cookie.
Wesley I don't feel we're getting off on quite the right foot.
Wesley Ah. This is perhaps Faith.
Faith New Watcher?
Buffy_and_Giles New Watcher.
Faith Screw that.
Buffy Now, why didn't *I* just say that?
Giles Uh, Buffy, would you...
Buffy I'll see if I can get her back. Don't say anything terribly interesting while I'm gone.
Wesley They'll get used to me.
Buffy Faith, wait. Look, I know this new guy's a dork, but... Well, I have nothing to follow that. He's pretty much just a dork.
Faith You're actually gonna take orders from him?
Buffy That's the job. What else can we do?
Faith Whatever we want. We're Slayers, girlfriend, the Chosen Two. Why should we let *him* take all the fun out of it?
Buffy Oh, that would be tragic, taking the fun out of slaying, stabbing, beheading.
Faith Oh, like you don't dig it.
Buffy I don't.
Faith You're a liar. I've *seen* you. Tell me staking a vamp doesn't get you a little bit juiced. Come on, say it.
Faith You can't fool me. The look in your eyes right after a kill? You just get hungry for more.
Buffy You're way off base.
Faith Tell me that if you don't get in a good slaying, after a while, you just start itching for some vamp to show up so you can give him a good!
Buffy Again with the grunting. You realize I'm not comfortable with this.
Faith Hey, slaying's what we were built for. If you're not enjoying it, you're doing something wrong.
Buffy What about the assignment?
Faith Tell you what: you do the homework, and I'll copy yours.
Buffy Strike one. No amulet there.
Buffy Game over.
Buffy Faith!
Faith What are you doing, hiding in there?
Buffy Looking for the amulet. Wasn't counting on the Special Guest Stars. Six against one. Hence the hiding.
Faith Well, it's six against two now, so come on.
Buffy Wait. Stop. Think!
Faith No, no, no!
Buffy It's a manhole. Tight space, no escape, six against two, not unlike three against one.
Faith And there might be more, so come on.
Buffy You're just gonna go down there. That's your plan.
Faith Who said I had a plan? I don't know how many's down there, but I wanna find out. And I'll know when I land. If you don't come in after me, I might die!
Wesley These are all the diaries, then? Yours included?
Giles That's everything. Knock yourself out. Please?
Wesley Oh, yes! Here's your first entry. 'Slayer is willful and insolent.' That would be our girl, wouldn't it?
Giles Well, you have to get to know her.
Wesley Mm. 'Her abuse of the English language is such that I understand only every other sentence.' Oh, this is going to make fascinating reading.
Giles She should be back by now.
Wesley Not to fret. My mission scenario has her back in one minute. Shouldn't be any trouble.
Buffy We're surrounded!
Faith You noticed that, too?!
Faith Lemme go!
Vincent Let's settle this honorably.
Vincent Well, then, let's just settle it.
Faith Buffy! You son of a bitch!
Buffy I hate it when they drown me.
Faith B! Gotta go!
Buffy We came for the amulet.
Faith Tell me you don't get off on this!
Buffy It didn't suck.
Wesley Well... Looks authentic enough. Of course, there are tests to be made before actual verification.
Buffy How about verifying that your 'nearly extinct' cult was out in magnum force last night? Faith and I got into a serious party situation.
Giles Are you alright?
Buffy I had to lather, rinse, and repeat about five million times to get the sewer out of my hair, but otherwise, I'm of the good. Thank you for asking.
Wesley Perhaps there were a few more than we'd anticipated, but I'd expect you to be ready for anything. Remember the three key words for any Slayer: preparation... preparation... preparation.
Buffy That's one word three times.
Buffy I have a chem test. So sad that I'm actually happy about that. Giles, we need to talk.
Wesley Buffy... I must ask you to remember that I am your Watcher. From now on, anything you have to say about slaying you will say to me. The only thing you need discuss with Mr. Giles is overdue book fees. Understood?
Buffy We'll talk.
Giles Of course.
Wesley You're not helping.
Giles No. I feel just sick about it.
Buffy It was intense. It was like I just... let go and became this force. I just didn't care anymore.
Willow Yeah, I know what that's like.
Buffy I don't think you can! It's kind of a Slayer thing. I don't even think I'm explaining it well.
Xander You're explaining it a lot, though.
Mrs._Taggart Alright. You have one period to fill out your test booklets. Periodic charts are located on the back. You're on the honor system, so remember, no talking.
Buffy You see, the thing was, Faith knew I didn't even wanna go down there...
Mrs._Taggart Ahem. Ms. Summers?
Mrs._Taggart You have one hour.
Buffy Okay, so the best part...
Willow Buffy. Test? You know. Remember? The thing you didn't come over to study for?
Buffy Right. Got it.
Buffy Sorry. Okay, so we're down there, in the sewers, and Faith got three of them on her at once...
Xander Hey! Whoa! Can we resume Buffy's 'Ode to Faith' later, like when I'm not actively multiple-choicing?
Buffy How come your eye twitches every time I say Faith's name?
Xander What? No, it doesn't.
Buffy Faith.
Xander Cut it out! We got a test to take, okay? And I'm highly caffeinated, and I'm trying to concentrate. Some of us actually care about school. You know.
Faith Hey, girlfriend. Bad time?
Willow No, sh-she can't!
Willow Y-you can't! Can you?
Buffy What's up?
Faith Vampires.
Buffy Uh, Faith, unless there's a total eclipse in the next five minutes, it's daylight.
Faith Good for us, bad for them. Found a nest.
Buffy Has potential.
Faith Rise and shine, people.
Buffy It's your wake-up call.
Buffy Hey! You're not leaving, are you?
Angel I saw you making friends.
Buffy Them?
Buffy Boys! I like you.
Buffy What's the matter? You're not afraid of little me, are ya?
Angel We better sit down. Come on.
Buffy I can sense this is a business trip.
Buffy What's the what?
Angel Balthazar.
Buffy Dead demon.
Angel Not as dead as you think.
Angel Word on the street puts him in the packing warehouse on Devereau. He's looking for...
Buffy His amulet. It's supposed to restore his strength.
Angel From what I'm hearing, that's not something we'd like to see happen.
Buffy No problem. We got the amulet.
Angel I know. I spoke to Giles, but he said you gave it to someone.
Wesley Ah. There you are.
Buffy Ah. Speak of the really annoying person.
Wesley You're certainly giving me a run for my money. I think we ought to establish that if you're going to go out slaying, you leave me a number where I can contact you.
Angel Where's the amulet?
Wesley Who are you?
Angel A friend. Do you have it?
Wesley It's somewhere safe.
Wesley How did you know?
Buffy It pooches your jacket.
Wesley Now, hang on a minute...
Angel Walking around with this thing is like wearing a target.
Buffy You're gonna put it somewhere safe that's actually safe?
Angel Yeah. I'll do it now.
Buffy I'll do some recon on Balthazar.
Wesley If I may... Balthazar is dead. Am I the only one that remembers that?
Angel Be careful.
Buffy You know me.
Angel I mean it.
Wesley What's going on?
Faith Call me!
Balthazar Let me tell you what I see.
Balthazar I see fear... and remorse... and the pitiful look of faces that cry out for mercy! But what I *don't* see is what I *want* to see, AND THAT'S... MY... AMULET!
Vampire Lord Balthazar, we found it! We had it! But the Slayers...
Balthazar Already I'm bored.
Balthazar Vincent... Come here.
Balthazar Closer.
Balthazar Closer.
Balthazar Let me tell you... what I want to see.
Buffy Okay, we got ten, maybe twelve bad guys and one big demon in desperate need of a Stairmaster.
Faith I say we take 'em all, hard and fast and now.
Buffy We need a little more firepower than none. We should head back to the library.
Faith Well, I guess Jacuzzi Boy isn't going anywhere. I just... wish we had...
Faith Ah. That is too good.
Faith Ah. Score.
Buffy Think they're insured?
Faith Strangely, not my priority. When are ya gonna get this, B? Life for a Slayer is very simple: want... take... have.
Buffy Want... take... have.
Buffy I'm gettin' it.
Officer Drop the weapons and get down on the ground! Now!
Officer I said drop the weapons, or I fire.
Officer Now spread 'em.
Faith You wish.
Officer Hands in the air where I can see 'em. Slow!
Officer Good. Now cuff 'em.
Faith I like him. He's butch.
Officer That's some artillery you two were puttin' together. You with one of them girl gangs?
Faith Yeah. We're the Slayers.
Faith You wanna get outta here?
Faith We can't save the world in jail.
Faith One, two...
Buffy We should call an ambulance.
Faith Five people already have, the racket we made, and they're fine.
Faith Come on. Let's get outta here.
Faith COME ON!
Joyce Admit it.
Joyce Some days don't you wanna just wake up and say to Hell with the diet? Wanna make waffles? Big Saturday brunch?
Buffy No, thanks. I'm not really that hungry.
Joyce So, what did you and Faith do last night?
Buffy Nothing. Uh... Nothing really important.
Joyce Don't worry. I'm not gonna meddle in your slaying. Just as long as you're careful.
Buffy I am.
Joyce You sure about those waffles?
Buffy Yeah. But if you want them, I can help you make them.
Joyce No. They only don't have calories if I make them for you. Mom logic. You, uh, done with the paper?
Buffy Yeah.
Joyce Let's see what's happening in Sunnydale.
Mayor_Wilkins There we go.
Mayor_Wilkins Thanks a lot, fellas. Thanks a heap.
Mayor_Wilkins Hey, have fun on that camping trip, now. Don't forget to roast a wiener for me.
Mayor_Wilkins Here we go. Alright, you can come out now.
Mayor_Wilkins Backbone of America, those little guys. Seeing the hope and courage on their bright little faces, I swear I could just, I... I could just eat 'em up. So, any news about the Eliminati?
Vincent In the name of Lord Balthazar, DIE!
Mayor_Wilkins Thank you, Mr. Trick. That was very thoughtful of you.
Trick Why do they always gotta be using swords? It's called an Uzi, ya chump! Could have saved your ass right about now.
Mayor_Wilkins You know, it's curious how he could've gotten all the way into my liquor cabinet. Allan, don't we have, don't we have security working in this building?
Allan Sir, I... I had no idea. I-I...
Mayor_Wilkins There's no need to swoon, Allan. But try to keep things secure. Lock him up.
Trick He wakes up, he's just gonna try and kill you again.
Mayor_Wilkins Yes. Yes, I expect he will.
Balthazar Vincent made a noble effort. Man to man, as befits a true warrior. He had courage... He had honor... AND I HAVE *JACK* TO SHOW FOR IT! It's been a hundred years since my enemy crippled me. Now ultimate power is within his grasp. And I shall *not* let it be! Forget about honor! Forget about everything! But getting my amulet! Bring the Watchers to me! Find the Slayers and kill them! Kill everything that gets in your way! GOOOOO! GOOOOO!
Buffy Mmm.
Willow You like it?
Buffy It smells good. What is it?
Willow Just a little something we witches like to call a protection spell.
Buffy Good deal, protection. I'm surprised, though, 'cause usually spell stuff's more...
Willow Stinky. Yeah. That's why I added lavender. Give me time, and I may be the first wicca to do all my conjuring in pine fresh scent. So what's the plan?
Willow For tonight's slayage. We're going, aren't we?
Buffy Yeah.
Willow Great!
Buffy But... there's a 'but'. And that's 'but you shouldn't come... tonight.' Is that cool?
Willow Well, sure. Makes sense. You know... You'll be facing big, hairy danger.
Buffy Uh, b-biggest and very hairy.
Willow You'll be risking your life.
Buffy Right. And why risk yours?
Willow Because I'm your friend?
Buffy I know, Will, and that's exactly why I don't want you going. It's, it's too dangerous.
Willow But I-I've done this sort of thing before! Like, a million times, and I can totally handle myself. Besides, minty fresh protection. So?
Faith Ready? Time to motor. Hey, Willow.
Willow Hi. Uh...
Buffy I really should... But we'll hang out later, right?
Willow Yeah. You, you go ahead. I'll just get my stuff.
Willow Stupid...
Faith You're quiet tonight.
Buffy I just wanna get this done.
Faith Yeah. I'm dying to test out the longbow. I think it might be my new thing.
Buffy I can't believe you went back for that stuff.
Faith Hey, how do you feel about getting some ribs? You know, after we're done?
Wesley I didn't say you had emotional problems. I said you had *an* emotional problem. It's quite different.
Giles My 'attachment' to the Slayer is not a problem. In point of fact, it's been a very...
Wesley The way you've handled this assignment is something of an embarrassment to the council.
Giles If you want to criticize my methods, fine. But you can keep your snide remarks to yourself. And while you're at it, don't criticize my methods.
Wesley The fact is, you're no longer qualified to act as Watcher. It's not your fault. You've done well. It's simply time for somebody else to take the field.
Giles Now's a good time to start.
Faith Screw it!
Faith I think we've got more comin'!
Buffy We're never gonna make it to the warehouse.
Faith If they keep coming one at a time, we got a shot.
Buffy FAITH, NO!
Buffy Don't move!
Faith I didn't... I didn't know. I didn't know.
Buffy We need to call 911, NOW!
Buffy Don't move, i-it's okay...
Buffy I-I need, I need something to stop the...
Faith We gotta go!
Faith Come on, we gotta go!
Faith Come on.
Buffy Angel!
Angel Buffy, I've been looking for you.
Angel Your hand.
Buffy It's okay.
Angel I've just been to the warehouse. I was waiting for you. They got Giles.
Balthazar The front! The front! Moisten the front!
Wesley Oh, God! Oh, God!
Giles It doesn't seem too promising, does it?
Wesley Stay calm, Mr. Giles. We have to stay calm.
Giles Well, thank God you're here. I was planning to panic.
Wesley What *is* that thing?
Giles That would be your demon. You know, the dead one?
Wesley There's no need to get snippy.
Balthazar Bring them closer.
Balthazar You know what I want.
Giles If it's for me to scrub those hard-to-reach areas, I'd like to request you kill me now.
Giles Ow.
Wesley Are you out of your mind? This is hardly the time for games!
Giles Why not? They're going to torture us to death anyway.
Balthazar You're not wrong about that.
Wesley Now, hold on. We-we-we can deal with this rationally. We have something you want. You have something we want.
Balthazar Hmm... A trade. Intriguing. No. Wait. Boring. Pull off his kneecaps!
Wesley NOOO! No, no, no! The Slayer g-gave it to someone. A tall man, a friend... a friend of hers. I can tell you everything.
Giles Quiet, you twerp! They'll kill us both.
Wesley But I'd like to have my kneecaps.
Balthazar You will tell us everything!
Wesley Yes! Sir.
Balthazar What is this friend's name?
Wesley I didn't actually catch it.
Giles Look, um, tell you what, let Captain Courageous here go, and I'll tell you what you need to know. How's that deal?
Balthazar THERE IS ONE DEAL! YOU WILL DIE QUICKLY, OR YOU WILL DIE SLOWLY! THE MAN WHO HAS MY AMULET! WHAT IS HIS NAAAME?!
Angel His name is Angel.
Balthazar Un... Unacceptable!
Balthazar UNACCEPTABLE!
Wesley Giles!
Giles DOWN!
Balthazar Slayer! You think you've won. When he rises... you'll wish I'd killed you all.
Mayor_Wilkins Potestatem matris nostrae in tenebris invoco. Maledictum filium tuum abomni periculo custodias nunc et in saecula!
Translation Our mother of darkness, I summon thee. Curse now your dangerous accursed son and protect him into the new age!
Mayor_Wilkins I don't understand why Allan would miss this. He's usually so punctual.
Trick Did it work?
Mayor_Wilkins Let's find out. Open the gate.
Trick You sure?
Mayor_Wilkins Oh! Hold on.
Mayor_Wilkins Okay. Now we're ready.
Mayor_Wilkins Well!
Mayor_Wilkins This officially commences the Hundred Days. Nothing can harm me until the Ascension. Gosh, I'm feeling chipper! Who's for a root beer?!
Buffy Faith, it's me.
Buffy Hey.
Faith Hey.
Buffy So, I, uh... How are ya doin'?
Faith I'm alright. You know me.
Buffy Faith, we need to talk about what we're gonna do.
Faith There's nothing to talk about. I was doing my job.
Buffy Being a Slayer is not the same as being a killer.
Buffy Faith, please don't shut me out here. Look, sooner or later, we're both gonna have to deal.
Faith Wrong.
Buffy We can help each other.
Faith I don't need it.
Buffy Yeah? Who's wrong now? Faith, you can shut off all the emotions that you want. But eventually, they're gonna find a body.
Faith Okay, this is the last time we're gonna have this conversation, and we're not even having it now, you understand me? There *is* no body. I took it, weighted it, and dumped it. The body doesn't exist.
Buffy Getting rid of the evidence doesn't make the problem go away.
Faith It does for me.
Buffy Faith, you don't get it. You *killed* a man.
Faith No, *you* don't get it. I don't care!

Engleman The project, it escaped.
Narrator/Giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
Buffy The Initiative created this thing and they can't stop it. But we will.
Buffy It's Faith, she's awake.
Joyce You all right.
Faith Five by five.
Mayor Open the box.
Mayor Surprise.
Buffy Five by five.
officer It's good you called. We've been looking for this girl since she broke out of the hospital.
Joyce What's gonna happen to her?
officer Well, get her checked out. She's in stable condition, she goes to jail, pending trial.
Joyce I just hope she gets some kind of help.
officer The first thing is to keep her from hurting anybody else.
Faith No. Personnel lifting her into
ambulance One two
officer Well, you guys will be safe now. We may have a couple of questions in the morning.
Joyce Oh, uh, of course.
officer Thank you. Both. I'm glad we finally got the kid.
Buffy She's not a kid! I just mean that she's very strong.
officer Yeah.
Buffy She truly is.
Joyce Faith.
Joyce Why do you think she's like that?
Buffy You know. She's a nut job. Heh.
Joyce I just don't understand what could drive a person to that kind of behavior.
Buffy Well, how do you know she got drove? I mean, maybe she likes being that way.
Joyce I'll never believe that. I think she's horribly unhappy.
Buffy Well, could be things are looking up. I mean, a little stint in the pokey, show her the error of her ways. I'm sure there's some big old Bertha just waiting to shower her ripe little self with affection.
Joyce Buffy!
Buffy I'm sorry, mom. It's just ufff when I think about how she might have hurt you, I just, uff I can't stand it.
Joyce Sorry.
Buffy No, I'm just, uff, sore from the fight.
Joyce I've missed you.
Buffy Cause I haven't visited, right? I knew it.
Joyce I know how it is. You have so much in your life now.
Buffy I'm a busy little beaver.
Joyce Of course. But um, maybe we could spend some time together soon? Some... night when I'm not being held hostage by a raving psychotic.
Buffy Count on it. I'm gonna take a bath.
Buffy Why, yes, I would be Buffy. May I help you?
Buffy Buffy.
Buffy You can't do that. it's wrong.
Buffy You can't do that because it's naughty.
Buffy Because it's wrong.
Buffy You can't do that. It's wrong. I'll kick your ass. I'm gonna kill you.
Faith Let me go! Let me go!
Doctor Get me a sedative now!
Officer Hold her!
Faith I have to go home! She's with my mother.
Faith No!
Doctor Just lie still.
Faith You don't understand.
Officer Keep holding her.
Faith She's taken my...my body.
Willow I wonder where she is.
Tara Who? Faith?
Willow Yeah. I wish she would make a move. she's making my stomach all acidy.
Tara But you think Buffy can handle her.
Willow I think so. but that doesn't mean Faith won't hurt someone else.
Tara Well, you should be safe. nobody knows you're here. I mean, uf, they don't even know I exist, right? I know all about them, but…
Willow Hey.
Tara I-I mean, t-that's totally cool. It-it's good. It-it's better.
Willow Tara, it's not like I don't want my friends to know you. It's just... well, Buffy's like my best friend, and she's really special. And there's this whole bunch of us, and we sort of have this group thing that revolves around the slaying, and-and I, I really want you to meet them. But I kind of like having something that's just, you know, mine. And I, I usually don't se so many words to say stuff that little, but do you get that at all?
Tara I do.
Willow I should check in with Giles, get a situation update.
Tara I am, you know.
Willow What?
Tara Yours.
Buffy Not too bad.
Buffy Score.
Buffy 6-4-4-7. Uh, expiration, 5-0-1. Unh huh. Yeah. 10 a.m.'s your earliest flight? I'll take it.
Joyce What are you doing?
Buffy Oh, just getting my mail.
Joyce Oh. Um, that was, um, Giles on the other line. He wanted you to meet your friends there. Said he had news.
Buffy Yeah. I got some time to kill. I'll go see the gang. All my friends. You don't mind if I steal this, right?
Joyce Is that the Harlot?
Buffy Yeah.
Joyce That's the same one Faith picked.
Buffy Burn it.
Policeman She's coming to. Uniformed
Policeman Yeah.
Policeman Man, I want this kid's constitution.
Faith Faith.
Policeman Let's move it. I want to get her in before she's 100%.
Weatherby By order of the Watcher's Council, you are being taken into custody until such time--
Collins Skip the speech.
Collins Let's go.
Giles Buffy. good.
Buffy The scooby gang's all here. Willow, Xander, and... everybody. What's up?
Giles It's about Faith, not surprisingly.
Buffy Didn't Joyce tell you? I already kicked that ass.
Xander I feel a high five coming on.
Willow Where is she?
Buffy On her way to the big house. Cops took her off my hands about an hour ago. Poetic justice.
Anya How's that?
Buffy Well, she did all those crimes, and now she's being arrested. I guess that's just regular justice. It's cool, anyway.
Giles Unless I'm mistaken, Faith is no longer in police custody.
Buffy What are you talking about?
Giles Watcher's Council. They uh sent a retrieval team to capture Faith.
Buffy Well, yeah, I mean, 'cause it worked so well when Wesley tried it.
Giles This is a special operations unit. They, uh, handle the council's trickier jobs - smuggling, interrogation, wetworks.
Willow What's wetworks?
Xander Scuba-type stuff.
Anya I thought it was murder.
Xander Well, yeah, but there could be underwater murder, with snorkels.
Buffy So they're taking her to England?
Giles It'll be a long, long time before she returns.
Buffy Heh heh heh. ahhh Hah hah. Hah hah. ohhh I'm sorry. It's just...I'm happy. Faith is evil.
Willow Yeah. I hope they throw the book at her.
Giles I'm not sure there is a, a book for this.
Willow They could throw other things.
Buffy I forgot how much you don't like Faith.
Willow After what she's done to you? Oh, I wish those council guys would let me have an hour alone in the room with her, if I was larger and had grenades.
Buffy I bet I know what Faith would say to that.
Anya So what you're saying is that everything's fine?
Giles Oh, um, yes.
Anya Well, I'm glad you called us all here because that information could never be conveyed by telephone. Willow What's up?
Giles Well, I just thought it was, uh, best to convene, in case there were any loose ends
Buffy I'd never let her hurt you.
Giles or things that we might have forgotten.
Willow I know.
Giles But if you're, uh, keen to go, then, please, by all means, go.
Xander We kind of have a romantic evening planned.
Anya We were gonna light a bunch of candles and have sex near them.
Buffy Well, we certainly don't want to cut into that seven minutes.
Anya Hey.
Xander I believe that's my hey. Hey!
Buffy Lighten up. We're out of danger. Everything's good.
Giles We still have Adam to take care of.
Buffy Yeah. Adam. What's up with him?
Giles I wish we knew.
Buffy Well, don't worry about it. I'll patrol tonight, as long as it takes. You guys have your fun, I'll be out there doing my job.
Buffy Whoop.
Spike Oh, you.
Buffy And you.
Spike What, are you keeping tabs on me? You're gonna give me a hard time now?
Buffy Um, do I usually give you a hard time?
Spike Very funny. Well, you don't have to worry about me drinking. Unless you're here to protect innocent beers.
Buffy You're a vampire.
Spike Was. And as soon as I get this chip out of my head, I'll be a vampire again. But until then, I'm just as helpless as a kitten up a tree. So why don't you sod off?
Buffy Ok.
Spike Oh, fine! Throw it in my face! Spike's not a threat anymore. I'll turn my back. He can't hurt me.
Buffy Spike? Spike. William the Bloody with a chip in his head. I kind of love this town.
Spike You know why I really hate you, Summers?
Buffy 'Cause I'm a stuck-up tight-ass with no sense of fun?
Spike Well, yeah, that covers a lot of it.
Buffy Cause I could do anything I want, and instead, I choose to pout and whine and feel the burden of slayerness? I mean, I could be rich, I could be famous, I could have anything. Anyone. Even you, Spike. I could ride you at a gallop until your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up. I've got muscles you've never even dreamed of. I could squeeze you until you popped like warm champagne, and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more. And you know why I don't? Because it's wrong. Humh humh.
Spike I get this chip out, you and me are gonna have a confrontation.
Buffy Count on it.
Vampire It was too crowded. We gotta hold out for a few hours, pick up a straggler, some drunk. Can't be calling attention to ourselves.
Adam I've been thinking. About vampires.
Vampire This is my place.
Adam You're place. Yes. The sewers. You hide from them, Crawl about in their filth. Scavenging like rats. What do you fear?
Vampire Kill this guy already.
Adam You fear the cross. The sun. Fire. And, oh, yes...
Adam I believe decapitation is a problem as well.
Vampire You can have the place. I mean, we don't have to stay here anymore.
Adam You fear death. Being immortal, you fear it more than those to whom it comes naturally. Vampires are a paradox.
Vampire Ok, we're a paradox. That's cool.
Adam Demon in a human body. You walk in both worlds and belong to neither. I can relate. Come. We have a lot to talk about.
Weatherby Well, it's awake.
Faith Who are you?
Weatherby Council. We're taking you back to the mother country. Seems you've been a naughty girl.
Faith Listen to me. Y-You've made a mistake. I am not Faith. I'm Buffy Summers.
Collins Congratulations. No one's ever actually tried that one on me before.
Faith You have to find Faith. C-call Giles. J-just get him here.
Collins Giles doesn't work for the council anymore. For that matter, neither does Buffy Summers. And what you are, miss, is a package. I deliver the package. I don't much care what's inside. Come on.
Weatherby He may not care, but I do. The Watcher's Council used to mean something. You perverted it. You trash. We should have killed you while you were asleep.
Willow I can't believe you've never been here. The Bronze is the coolest place in Sunnydale. Of-of course, there's not a lot of competition. I think the vending machine at Bergen's came in second.
Tara Y-you used to come here a lot?
Others Chug chug chug
Willow I lived here. Me, Xander…
Buffy & others Chug, chug, chug.
Willow Buffy.
Buffy & others Chug, chug, chug.
Buffy oooh ooooh
Others Chug, chug, chug!
Others Woo hoo hoo.
Willow Wow. I-I didn't think she'd be here. Come on, I want you to meet her.
Buffy Back off. You're nothing but a disappointment.
Willow Hey, Buffy.
Buffy Willow and - uh
Willow Buffy, this is Tara.
Tara Hi.
Buffy So we've never met. Cool. Just have a thing with names.
Willow Tara was in my wicca group.
Buffy Unh-huh.
Willow So, what's up? Patrol a no go?
Buffy Got tired. You know, the whole Faith thing. I let off some steam.
Willow Good for you. You shouldn't work yourself too hard.
Buffy That's my philosophy.
Willow Anyone want a soda?
Tara Water.
Buffy So you guys been hanging out a lot lately, hunh?
Tara Yeah. she's, um, she's really cool.
Buffy So Willow's not driving stick anymore. Who would have thought? I guess you never really know someone until you've been inside their sking. And Oz is out of the picture? Oh, never seen two people so much in love. She just couldn't get enough of old Oz.
Tara She, um, said he, uh, uh, w-w-w-w-w-went
Buffy He w-w-w-w-what? You gonna get that sentence out sometime tonight?
Willow Buffy, guy in the corner.
Buffy Yeah. Good call.
Tara What?
Willow Vampire.
Buffy Wicked obvious. So I should slay him.
Willow You want help?
Buffy Nah, I got it.
Buffy Hey!
Buffy You'll live.
Girl Uh he was so strong, uh
Buffy Yeah, well, he's gone now.
Girl Thank you. Thank you.
Buffy Yeah. It's cool.
Willow Everything poofed?
Buffy All's well in the world.
Willow Tara's not feeling well. I'm gonna walk her home.
Buffy Yeah. You give her whatever she needs.
Willow Are you gonna be in later, or you going over to Riley's?
Smith This'll bloody keep you quiet.
Smith Uh.
Faith How about this? I'll be quiet, and you can scream.
Smith Aaahh.
Faith Now you unchain me - very slowly And! politely, or I kill this guy
Collins When we go on a job, we always put our affairs in order first, in case of accident.
Smith Collins...
Collins Sorry, Smithy.
Collins She's starting to bother me.
Weatherby Getting her across the border is gonna be a lot more trouble than it's worth.
Collins If the council can even get us passage. I'll call them. It's time for a contingency plan.
Buffy Hi, baby.
Willow I'm sorry you're feeling all blechy. But we'll get together with Buffy another time. Sometime soon. I think you'll really like her.
Tara She's not your friend.
Willow I may have overestimated the you liking her factor.
Tara No, no. I mean, I don't... I don't think she's...her.
Willow You lost me.
Tara Well, umph, a person's energy has a flow, a unity. Buffy's was was fragmented. It-it grated, like something forced in where it doesn't belong. Plus, she was, um, she was kind of mean.
Willow So you think Buffy's not herself? Like she's been possessed or something?
Tara I'm not sure.
Willow You didn't sense a hyena energy at all, did you? Because hyena possession is just...unpleasant.
Tara Do you have anything of hers?
Willow Of Buffy's? Uhhhh. Oh! This ring.
Tara I-I think there's a way we can, hmm... The passage to the nether realm. There-there's a ritual. If you can find Buffy there, you should be able to see.
Willow If it'll help her.
Willow What?
Tara Well, the nether realm exists beyond the physical world. Accessing it is... I-it-it's kind of like astral projection. It's very intense. I'd have to be your anchor, keep you on this plane.
Willow I trust you.
Tara It-it's not like anything that we've ever
Willow I trust you.
Buffy You miss me?
Riley I did, actually. Everything's ok?
Buffy Everything's great.
Riley What about Faith?
Buffy Faith has a won a fabulous trip to England, and I got the consolation prize, which is you.
Riley So I don't have to worry about Faith showing up? Though I have to admit, I was kind of curious to meet her.
Riley Or I was until about 30 seconds ago.
Buffy Oh, you wouldn't have liked Faith. She's not proper and joyless, like a girl should be. She has a tendency to give in to her animal instincts.
Riley Door's open.
Buffy So?
Riley So my fantasies don't tend to include a bunch of marines staring in at me.
Buffy Oh, maybe they could learn something.
Buffy You're hurt.
Riley Ahh, um, not that bad, actually. I guess the, uh, drugs the professor gave me really did make me stronger. I'm healing pretty quick.
Buffy Maybe we should take you for a test drive.
Riley I wouldn't say no.
Buffy So...how do you want me?
Riley How do I?
Buffy Yeah. what do you wanna do with this body? What nasty little desire have you been itching to try out? Am I a bad girl? Do you wanna hurt me?
Riley What are we playing at here?
Buffy I'm Buffy.
Riley Ok. then I'll be Riley.
Buffy Well, if you don't wanna play--
Riley Right. I don't wanna play.
Riley I love you.
Buffy Uggnnh Get off. No. No. No! Get-get off! No. Off me. Get off. No, no-o. G-get
Riley Buffy...What? What's wrong?
Buffy Who are you? What do you want from h-her?
Riley Should I not have...?
Buffy This is meaningless.
Riley You're shaking.
Buffy Nnnh.
Riley What happened?
Buffy Nothing. Nothing.
Adam I have a gift no man has. No demon has ever had. I know why I'm here. I was created to kill. To extinguish life wherever I find it. And I have accepted that responsibility. You have lived in fear and desperation because you didn't have that gift. But it's time to face your fear.
Vampire Tell us what to do.
Adam You are here to be my first. To let them know that I am coming.
Vampire We're ready.
Adam Then ask yourself, what is it? More than man, more than anything else. What is the thing you fear?.
Forrest Hope you left him alive.
Buffy What?
Forrest Boy's supposed to be on the mend. I don't see you letting him get much rest.
Buffy I think maybe you should stay out of other people's lives.
Forrest We've got a mission here. Back when Riley could still think for himself...
Buffy You've got a mission? I've been fighting demons since before you could shave.
Forrest Yeah, you're a killer.
Buffy I am not a killer!!! I am the slayer!. And you don't know the first thing about me.
Forrest You really care what I think?
Buffy No. I don't care. God, I don't care.
Collins They can't get us passage. They've ordered the kill.
Weatherby Torch the place?
Collins Get the gas.
Smith She could've killed me. She didn't.
Collins Lucky you.
Smith Weatherby!
Faith Keys, keys.
Weatherby Stop her, you ponce.
Faith Ok, I'm good at this.
Faith Ooh, drive.
Woman Here, there you go.
Buffy Thank you.
Woman You're welcome.
Faith Giles!
Giles God!
Faith Don't move. Ok, Giles, you have to listen to me very carefully. I'm not Faith.
Giles Really?
Faith Really.
Giles Cause the resemblance is striking.
Faith I know. Giles, you just have to... Stop inching. you were inching.
Giles Look, I-I know what you're going to say, and-and uh
Faith I'm Buffy.
Giles All right, I didn't know what you were going to say, but that doesn't make you any less crazy.
Faith Faith switched. I mean, she had some device. She switched our bodies. Giles, I swear it's me.
Giles U-um, if-if you are Buffy, then, uh, then you'll let me tie you up w-without killing me - until we find out whether you're telling the truth.
Faith Giles, Faith has taken my body, and for all I know, she's taken it to Mexico by now. I-I don't have time for bondage fun. Ask me a question. Ask me anything.
Giles Who's president?
Faith We're checking for Buffy, not a concussion.
Giles Oh, yes, Alright. um...
Faith Umph, Giles, you turned into a demon, and I knew it was you. I mean can't you just look in my eyes and be all intuitive?
Giles How did I turn into a demon?
Faith Oh, cause, uh, Ethan Rayne. And-and you have a girlfriend named Olivia, and you haven't had a job since we blew up the school, which is valid lifestyle wise. I mean, it's not like you're a slacker type, but... Oh, oh! when I had psychic power, I heard my mom think that you were like a stevedore during sex. What? Do you want me to continue?
Giles Actually, I beg you to stop.
Faith What's a stevedore?
Giles Alright, let's-- um, I need you to explain everything.
Faith And I will, after we get Faith.
Willow Giles!
Faith Will.
Willow Oh, my god.
Faith Willow, wait. you don't understand.
Willow You're Buffy. You and Faith switched bodies, probably through a Draconian Katra spell.
Giles She understands it better than I do.
Faith How did you?
Willow Tara. Tara, this is Buffy, only really this time.
Tara Hi.
Willow Tara's a really powerful witch.
Tara Not really.
Willow No, really. She knew right away that you weren't you. So we connected with the nether realms to find out what happened. And we conjured this.
Faith What is--
Willow It's a Katra. Or the home-conjured version. It-it should switch you back, if you can get a hold of Faith.
Faith Oh, thank God.
Giles I'll get it.
Giles Hello.
Faith Do you know where Faith is?
Giles Oh yes, uh, Buffy's here with uh, me. Actually, she--she's uh Oh, all right.
Giles Xander. Apparently there's a report on the television.
News announcer ...and barricaded themselves in the church with at least 20 parishioners. One of the few who escaped described the three men as frighteningly disfigured, almost inhuman. So far, one escapee has since died of severe neck wounds.
News announcer There is no report on the condition of the parishioners still trapped inside, but their assailants have vowed to kill all of them if police attempt to storm the church. Interior of church.
Vampire It's hard to believe. I've been avoiding this place for so many years, and it's nothing. It's nice! It's got the pretty windows, The pillars... lots of folks to eat. Where's the thing I was so afraid of? You know, the Lord? He was supposed to be here. He gave us this address. Well, we'll just have to start killing off His people, see if He shows up.
Riley What'd he say?
Policeman He said I should defer command to you.
Riley Then you hold your men until the reserves arrive. This is a military situation.
Policeman What, they got bombs in there?
Riley Your men are not prepared to deal with them. Just trust me.
Riley Buffy.
Buffy How many are in there?
Riley We think there's three.
Buffy I can do three.
Riley Not alone. Look wait for the troops to get here. They're still mobilizing.
Buffy How did you respond so fast?
Riley I didn't. I was just late for church.
Buffy Look, when the troops get here, send 'em in, but I'm going.
Riley I don't want you risking--
Buffy Don't tell me what to do! I'm Buffy. I have to do this.
Riley Then I'm coming with.
Riley Ow!
Buffy I can't use you. someone comes out, you get 'em to safety. Unless they've got fangs.
Vampire I told the cops, they send any one in, I start the whole massacre thing.
Buffy Well, I'm not the cops. I just come to pray.
Vampire now's a good time to start.
Buffy You're *not* gonna kill these people.
Vampire Why not?
Buffy Because it's wrong.
Vampire You're the slayer.
Buffy The one and only.
Policeman You people, get out of here!
Willow We've gotta get inside.
Policeman The police are handling this. Just back off right now.
Willow But we can't, we've gotta, Y- you don't understand.
Policeman Listen you have to clear the area.
Giles Damn it, man, we have to get inside. Our, um, uh uh families are in there. Our, um, mothers and-and tiny, tiny babies.
Vampire You think we're afraid of you? We're not afraid Of anything anymore.
Buffy Then let all these people go, and all three of you can take me on.
Vampire Heh. I got a better idea.
Riley You forgot your coat.
Faith Riley.
Riley Ohh. It's ok, miss. Just get yourself out of harm's way.
Faith Riley, it's me. Uh. Never mind. How many are in there?
Riley Well...who are you?
Vampire I have strength you couldn't dream of. Adam has shown me the way, and there is nothing --aah.
Faith You can't win this.
Buffy Shut up! Do you think I'm afraid of you? You're nothing. Disgusting. Murderous bitch. You're nothing. You're disgusting. Now Buffy is in her own body. And Faith is in her own body.
Buffy She's gone. not a trace. Giles said the council guys have cleared out, too.
Riley I don't understand. how could she have... ummph I mean, how's it possible?
Buffy Magic.
Riley There was something. I should've picked up on it. I should've just...
Buffy You slept with her.
Riley I slept with you.
Riley Man, would I like to get my hands on her. Not in a sex way.
Buffy I don't think she's coming back.
Riley Guess she's had her fun.
Buffy Yeah. Fun.

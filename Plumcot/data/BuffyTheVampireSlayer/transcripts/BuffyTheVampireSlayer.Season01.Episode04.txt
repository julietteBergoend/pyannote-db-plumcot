xander_harris May I cut in?
xander_harris You alright?
buffy_summers Thanks to you!
buffy_summers You hurt your hand! Will you still be able to...
xander_harris ...finish my solo and kiss you like you've never been kissed before?
buffy_summers You're drooling.
buffy_summers Xander!
buffy_summers You've got a little...
dr_gregory Their ancestors were here long before we were. Their progeny will be here long after we are gone. The simple and ubiquitous ant.
dr_gregory Now. If you read the homework you should know the two ways that ants communicate.
dr_gregory Miss Summers.
buffy_summers Ways that ants communicate.
dr_gregory Mm.
buffy_summers With other ants.
dr_gregory From the homework.
dr_gregory Ants are communicating...
buffy_summers Um, uh, uh...
buffy_summers Touch...
dr_gregory Mm-hmm.
buffy_summers And, um...
buffy_summers B.O.?
blayne_moll Thank God someone finally found the courage to mention that!
dr_gregory That would be 'touch' and 'smell', Miss Summers. Is there anything else Miss Rosenberg would like to tell you?
dr_gregory Alright, chapters six through eight by tomorrow, people. Can I see you for a moment?
dr_gregory I gather you had a few problems at your last school?
buffy_summers Well, what teenager doesn't?
dr_gregory Cut school, get in fights, burn down the gymnasium... Principal Flutie showed me your permanent record.
buffy_summers Well, that fire, I mean, there was major extenuating circumstances. Actually, it's, uh, kinda funny!
dr_gregory Can't wait to see what you're gonna do *here*.
buffy_summers Destructo Girl. That's me.
dr_gregory But I suspect it's gonna be great.
buffy_summers You mean, 'great' in a bad way?
dr_gregory You have a first-rate mind and you can think on your feet. Imagine what you could accomplish if you actually did the...
buffy_summers ...the homework thing.
dr_gregory The homework thing. I understand you probably have a good excuse for not doing it. Amazingly enough, I don't care. I know you can excel in this class, and so I expect no less. Is that clear?
buffy_summers Yeah! Sorry.
dr_gregory Don't be sorry, be smart. And please don't listen to the principal or anyone else's negative opinion about you. Let's make 'em eat that permanent record. Whadaya say?
buffy_summers Okay! Thanks.
dr_gregory Chapters six through eight!
blayne_moll Seven, including Cheryl. I'll tell you, though, her sister was lookin' to make it eight!
boy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode04 Ooo, Cheryl's sister? The one in college?
blayne_moll Home for the holidays and lookin' for love! She's not my type, though. Girls really gotta have something to go with me.
xander_harris Something like a lobotomy?
blayne_moll Xander. How many times you score?
xander_harris Well, uh...
blayne_moll It's just a question.
xander_harris Are we talking today, or the whole week?
xander_harris Ooo! Duty calls!
xander_harris Babes!
buffy_summers What are you doing?
xander_harris Work with me here. Blayne had the nerve to question my manliness. I'm just gonna give him a visual.
willow_rosenberg We'll show him!
buffy_summers I don't believe it.
xander_harris I know, and after all my conquests.
xander_harris Who's that?
willow_rosenberg That must be Angel! I think?
xander_harris That weird guy that warned her about all the vampires?
willow_rosenberg That's him, I'll bet you.
xander_harris Well, he's buff! She never said anything about him being buff!
willow_rosenberg You think he's buff?
xander_harris He's a very attractive man! How come *that* never came up?
buffy_summers Well! Look who's here!
angel Hi.
buffy_summers I'd say it's nice to see you, but then we both know that's a big fib.
angel I won't be long.
buffy_summers No, you'll just give me a cryptic warning about some exciting new catastrophe, and then disappear into the night. Right?
angel You're cold.
buffy_summers You can take it.
angel I mean, you look cold.
xander_harris Oh, right! Give her your jacket. It's a balmy night, no one needs to be trading clothing out there!
buffy_summers A little big on me. What happened?
angel I didn't pay attention.
buffy_summers To somebody with a big fork?
angel He's coming.
buffy_summers The Fork Guy?
angel Don't let him corner you. Don't give him a moment's mercy. He'll rip your throat out.
buffy_summers Okay, I'll give you improved marks for that one. Ripping a throat out, it's a strong visual, it's not cryptic!
angel I have to go.
buffy_summers Sweet dreams to you, too.
rupert_giles That's all he said? Fork Guy?
buffy_summers That's all Cryptic Guy said: Fork Guy.
rupert_giles I think there are too many 'guys' in your life.
rupert_giles I'll see what I can find out. God, every day here is the same.
buffy_summers Bright, sunny, beautiful, how ever can we escape this torment?
rupert_giles Really.
rupert_giles Good morning.
xander_harris Mornin'. Guess what I just heard in the office? No Dr. Gregory today. Ergo, those of us who blew off our science homework aren't as dumb as we look.
buffy_summers What happened, is he sick?
xander_harris They didn't say anything about sick, something about missing.
buffy_summers He's missing?
xander_harris Well, let me think. Um, the cheerleaders were modeling their new short skirts, that kinda got... Yeah! Yeah, they said missing.
xander_harris Which is bad?
buffy_summers If something's wrong, yeah!
willow_rosenberg He's one of the only teachers that doesn't think Buffy's a felon.
xander_harris I'm really sorry, I'm sure he'll...
xander_harris I, uh, huh...
xander_harris Uh, huh... huh...
natalie_french Could you help me?
xander_harris Uuuuuuhhhhhh... Yes!
natalie_french I'm looking for Science... 109.
xander_harris Oh! It's, um...
xander_harris I go there every day!
xander_harris Oh, God, where is it?
blayne_moll Hi! Blayne Mall. I'm going there right now. It's not far from the varsity field where I took All-City last year.
natalie_french Oh! Thank you, Blayne!
xander_harris It's funny how the Earth never opens up and swallows you when you want it to.
willow_rosenberg What's wrong?
buffy_summers Dr. Gregory dropped his glasses... Why wouldn't he pick them up?
natalie_french My name is Natalie French, and I will be substituting for Dr. Gregory.
buffy_summers Do you know when he's coming back?
natalie_french No, I don't, um, Buffy. They just call and tell me where they want me.
blayne_moll I'll tell you where I want you.
natalie_french Excuse me, Blayne?
blayne_moll Uh, I was just wondering if you were gonna pick up where Dr. Gregory left off.
natalie_french Yes. His notes tell me you were right in the middle of insect life.
natalie_french The praying mantis is a fascinating creature. Forced to live alone. Who can tell me why? Buffy?
buffy_summers Well, the words 'bug-ugly' kinda spring to mind.
natalie_french There is nothing ugly about these unique creatures. The reason they live alone is because they're cannibals!
buffy_summers Eww!
natalie_french Oh, well, it's hardly their fault! It's the way nature designed them: noble, solitary and prolific. Over 1800 species worldwide, and in nearly all of them the female is larger *and* more aggressive than the male.
blayne_moll Nothing wrong with an aggressive female.
natalie_french The California Mantis lays her eggs, and then finds a mate...
natalie_french ...to fertilize them. Once he's played his part, she covers the eggs in a protective sack and attaches it to a leaf or twig out of danger. Now, if she's done her job correctly, in a few months she'll have several hundred offspring.
natalie_french You know, we should make some model egg sacks for the science fair. Who would like to help me do that after school?
natalie_french Good!
buffy_summers Hot dog surprise. Be still, my heart.
willow_rosenberg Call me old-fashioned, I don't want any more surprises in my hot dogs.
xander_harris I wonder what she sees in me? It's probably the quiet good looks coupled with a certain smoky magnetism.
xander_harris Miss French. You two're probably a little young to understand what an older woman would see in a younger man.
buffy_summers Oh, I understand.
xander_harris Good!
buffy_summers The younger man is too dumb to wonder why an older woman can't find someone her own age, and too desperate to care about the surgical improvements!
xander_harris What surgical improvements?
willow_rosenberg Well, he is young.
buffy_summers And so terribly innocent!
xander_harris Hey, those that can, do. Those that can't *laugh* at those who... can do.
blayne_moll Gotta carb up for my one-on-one with Miss French today. When's yours? Oh, right, tomorrow. You came in second, I came in first. Guess that's what they call natural selection.
xander_harris Guess it's what they call a rehearsal! Rehearsal...
cordelia_chase Excuse you!
cordelia_chase Medically prescribed lunch. My doctor ships it daily... I'll only be here as long as I can hold my breath.
cordelia_chase His head! His head! Oh, my God, where's his head?!
rupert_giles Here. Drink this.
buffy_summers No, thank you.
xander_harris I've never seen...
xander_harris I mean, I've never seen anything like... That was new.
willow_rosenberg Who would wanna hurt Dr. Gregory?
rupert_giles Uh, he didn't have any enemies on the staff that I'm aware of. He was a civilized man. I liked him.
buffy_summers So did I.
willow_rosenberg Well, we're gonna find out who did this. We'll find them and we'll stop them.
buffy_summers Count on it.
rupert_giles What do we know?
buffy_summers Oh, not a lot, um... He was killed here on campus. I'm guessing the last day we saw him.
rupert_giles How do you work that out?
buffy_summers He didn't change his clothing.
xander_harris This is a question that no one particularly wants to hear, but... where did they put his head?
willow_rosenberg Good point. I *didn't* wanna hear that.
buffy_summers Angel! He warned me that something was coming.
rupert_giles Yes. Yes he did, didn't he? I wish I knew what he meant. I've been trying to gather more information about the Master, our, uh, local vampire king. There was one oblique reference to a, a, a vampire who displeased the Master and cut his hand off in penance.
buffy_summers Cut off his hand and replaced it with a fork?
rupert_giles I don't know what he replaced it with.
xander_harris So, why would he come after a teacher?
rupert_giles I'm not certain he did. There was an incident two nights ago...
rupert_giles ...uh, involving a homeless person in Weatherly Park. He was practically shredded, but, uh, nothing like Dr. Gregory.
buffy_summers Fork Guy doesn't do heads.
rupert_giles Not historically.
buffy_summers And Dr. Gregory's blood wasn't drained.
xander_harris So there's something else out there? Besides Silverwareman? Oh, this is fun, we're on Monster Island.
buffy_summers We're on a Hellmouth. It's a center of mystical convergence. Guess it's the same thing.
rupert_giles Well, unpleasant things do gravitate here, it's true, but, uh, we don't know there's anything besides this chap. He's still our likely suspect.
buffy_summers Where was that guy killed? Weatherly Park?
rupert_giles Buffy. I know you're upset, but, uh, this is no time to go hunting, not until we know more. Please promise me you won't do anything rash?
buffy_summers Cross my heart.
band_member Shouldn't be out here at night, little lady. Dangerous.
Voices#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode04 Hold it! Police! Did you see that? I got nothing here!
Voices#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode04 I heard it. Spread out. Let's go over here. This way, this way. Alright...
rupert_giles You went hunting last night.
buffy_summers Yes.
rupert_giles When you assured me you wouldn't.
buffy_summers Yes, I lied, I'm a bad person, let's move on.
rupert_giles Did you see someone with a fork?
buffy_summers More like a jumbo claw.
rupert_giles Oh. Well, uh, at least you're not hurt.
buffy_summers And I saw something else. Something much more interesting than your average run-of-the-mill killer vampire.
rupert_giles Oh?
buffy_summers Do you know Miss French, the teacher that's subbing for Dr. Gregory?
rupert_giles Yes. Yes, she's lovely. In a, a common, extremely well proportioned way.
buffy_summers Well, I'm chasing Claw Guy last night, and Miss Well Proportioned is heading home. The Claw Guy takes one look at her and runs screaming for cover.
rupert_giles He what? Ran away?
buffy_summers He was petrified.
rupert_giles Of Miss French?
buffy_summers Uh-huh! So I'm an undead monster that can shave with my hand... How many things am I afraid of?
rupert_giles Not many. And not substitute teachers, as a rule.
buffy_summers So what's her deal?
rupert_giles I think perhaps it would be a good idea if we kept an eye on her.
buffy_summers Then I better get to class.
principal_bob_flutie You were there. You saw Dr. Gregory, didn't you?
buffy_summers Um, you mean yesterday in the cafeteria when we found him...
principal_bob_flutie Don't say dead! Or decapitated, or decomposing, I'd stay away from D-words altogether. But you witnessed the event, so this way, please.
buffy_summers Well, no, I'm gonna be late for biology...
principal_bob_flutie Extremely late! You have to see a counselor. Everyone who saw the body has to see a crisis counselor.
buffy_summers But I really don't need...
principal_bob_flutie We all need help with our feelings. Otherwise we bottle them up, and before you know it, powerful laxatives are involved. I really believe if we all reach out to one another we can beat this thing. I'm always here if you need a hug, but not a real hug! Because there's no touching, this school is sensitive to wrong touching.
buffy_summers But, I really, really don't...
principal_bob_flutie No, you have to talk to a counselor and start the healing. You have to heal.
buffy_summers But Mr. Flutie, I...
principal_bob_flutie Heal!
cordelia_chase I don't know what to say, it was really, I mean, one minute you're in your normal life, and then who's in the fridge? It really gets to you, a thing like that. It was... let's just say I haven't been able to eat a thing since yesterday. I think I lost, like, seven and a half ounces? Way swifter than that so-called diet that quack put me on. Oh, I'm not saying that we should kill a teacher every day just so I can lose weight, I'm just saying when tragedy strikes, we have to look on the bright side. You know?
cordelia_chase Like, how even used Mercedes still have leather seats!
natalie_french Keep your eyes straight ahead on your own test.
natalie_french I think you meant 'pollination' for number fourteen. I'll see you here after school.
buffy_summers Oh, great, a pop quiz.
buffy_summers No, I'm not saying she craned her neck. We are talking full-on Exorcist twist.
willow_rosenberg Ouch!
buffy_summers Which reminds me, how come Blayne, who worked with her one-on-one yesterday, isn't here today?
willow_rosenberg Inquiring minds wanna know.
buffy_summers Any luck?
rupert_giles Um, I've not found any creature as yet that strikes terror in a vampire's heart.
buffy_summers Try looking under things that can turn their heads all the way around.
rupert_giles Nothing human can do that.
buffy_summers No, nothing human. There are some insects that can. Whatever she is, I'm gonna be ready for her.
rupert_giles What are you going to do?
buffy_summers My homework.
buffy_summers Where are the books on bugs?
xander_harris Hi!
natalie_french Oh, Hi! I was just grabbing a snack. Can I fix you something?
xander_harris No thanks, I never... eat when I'm making egg sacks. Wow, if this were real the bugs would be...
natalie_french ...as big as you!
xander_harris Yeah! So! Where do we start?
natalie_french Oh, Xander! I've done something really stupid. I hope you can forgive me.
xander_harris Oh, forgiveness is my middle name! Well, actually it's LaVelle, and I'd appreciate it if you guard that secret with your life.
natalie_french I have a teacher's conference in half an hour, and I left the paint and papier-mâché at home. I don't suppose you'd like to come to my place tonight to work on it there?
xander_harris Come to, uh... your place?
natalie_french 7:30? Here's my address.
natalie_french I'll see you tonight?
xander_harris Yeah!
xander_harris Ooo, yes!
buffy_summers Dig this: 'The praying mantis can rotate its head 180 degrees while waiting for its next meal to walk by.' Ha! Well, c'mon, guys. Ha!
willow_rosenberg Well, Miss French is sort of big. For a bug?
rupert_giles And she is, by and large, woman shaped.
buffy_summers Okay. Factoid 1: Only the praying mantis can rotate its head like that. Factoid 2: A pretty whacked-out vampire is scared to death of her. Factoid 3: Her fashion sense screams predator.
willow_rosenberg It's the shoulder pads.
buffy_summers Exactly.
rupert_giles If you're right, then she'd have to be a shape shifter or a perception distorter. On a helpful note, I had a chum at Oxford, Carlyle, advanced degrees in entomology mythology.
buffy_summers Entoma-who?
rupert_giles Bugs and fairy tales.
buffy_summers I knew that.
rupert_giles If I recall correctly, poor old Carlyle, just before he went mad, claimed there was some beast...
willow_rosenberg Buffy, 911! Blayne's mom called the school. He never came home last night.
rupert_giles The boy who worked with Miss French yesterday?
willow_rosenberg Yeah! If Miss French is responsible for... Xander's supposed to be helping her right now! He's got a crush on a giant insect!
buffy_summers Okay, don't panic, I'll warn him. But I need you to hack onto the coroner's office for me.
willow_rosenberg Well, what are we looking for?
buffy_summers Autopsy on Dr. Gregory. I've been trying to figures out these marks that I saw on his corpse... I'm thinking they were teeth. And, uh, these cuddlies? Should definitely be brushing after every meal. And you were saying something about a beast?
rupert_giles Oh, uh, yeah, I just need to make one transatlantic telephone call. Um, this computer invasion that Willow's performing on the coroner's office, one, one assumes it is entirely legal?
willow_rosenberg Entirely!
buffy_summers Of course!
rupert_giles Right. Wasn't here, didn't see it, couldn't have stopped you.
buffy_summers Good idea.
buffy_summers Hey!
xander_harris Hey!
buffy_summers So, how'd it go with Miss French?
xander_harris Well, it's a bit demanding being her absolute favorite guy in the universe, but I'll muddle through.
buffy_summers Xander, she's not what she seems.
xander_harris I know, she's so much more.
buffy_summers Okay, um... I'm gonna have to tell you something about her, and I'm gonna need you to really listen, okay?
xander_harris Okay.
buffy_summers I don't think she's human.
xander_harris I see. So if she's not human she's...?
buffy_summers Technically? A big bug.
buffy_summers This sounds really weird, I'm aware of that...
xander_harris It doesn't sound weird at all, I completely understand. I've met someone, and you're jealous.
buffy_summers What?
xander_harris Look, there's nothing I can do about it. Uh, there's just this certain chemical thing between Miss French and me.
buffy_summers I know, I read all about it, it's call, um, a pheromone. It's a chemical attractant that insects give off.
xander_harris She's not an insect! She's a woman, okay? And hard as that may be for you to conceive, an actual woman finds me attractive. I realize it's no mystery guy handing out leather jackets, and while we're on the subject, what kind of a girlie name is 'Angel' anyway?
buffy_summers What does that have to do with...
xander_harris Nothing! It just kinda bugs me. Look, I really gotta...
buffy_summers Wha...?
natalie_french Hi! Come on in!
natalie_french Should I change? Is, is this too...
xander_harris No, no, it's, the most beautiful chest... dress I've ever seen.
natalie_french Thank you. That's sweet. Martini? Oh, I'm sorry, would you like something else?
natalie_french I just need to relax a little, I'm kinda nervous around you. You're probably cool as a cucumber!
xander_harris I like cucumbers. Like in that Greek salad thing with the yogurt. Do you like Greek food? I'm exempting Schwarma, of course, I mean, what's that all about? It's a big meat hive.
xander_harris Hhhhhhho! Hello!
natalie_french Cheers! Can I ask you a personal question?
natalie_french Have you ever been with a woman before?
xander_harris You mean, like, in, uh, the same room?
natalie_french You know what I mean.
xander_harris Oh, that, uh... Well, let me think. Um...
xander_harris Yeah, there was, uh... several!
xander_harris I mean, and, uh, quite a few times... And then there was, uh... Oh, she was incredibly... No. Uh-uh.
natalie_french I know. I can tell.
xander_harris You can?
natalie_french Oh, I like it. You might say, I... *need* it.
xander_harris Oh! Well, needs should, uh, y'know... Needs should definitely be met, as long as it doesn't require ointments the next day, or...
xander_harris Do you hear...
natalie_french No...
xander_harris Sounds like someone crying...
natalie_french I don't hear anything. Your hands are so hot!
buffy_summers Oh, you hurt your hand!
xander_harris Buffy. I love Buffy. Wow! So that's a martini, huh?
natalie_french Mm-hmm.
xander_harris Do you hear...
natalie_french Would you like to touch me with those hands?
xander_harris Your hands are sss... really... serrated! Oh, wow, that martini, I... I really think I have to...
xander_harris Miss... French?
natalie_french Please, call me Natalie.
rupert_giles Frankly, madam, I haven't the faintest idea what time it is, nor do I care. Now, unlock his cell, unstrap him, and bring him to the telephone immediately. This is a matter of life and death!
willow_rosenberg Got it! Coroner's report, complete with... Yuk! ...color pictures.
buffy_summers There *are* teeth marks. Which match perfectly the one insect that nips off its prey's head.
willow_rosenberg Okay, I-I don't like this.
buffy_summers Huh! It's the way they feed, head first. It's also the way they mate. The female bites off the male's head while they're...
willow_rosenberg No, no, no! See? Xander's, I like his head! I-it's where you find his eyes, and his hair, and his adorable smile...
buffy_summers Hey, hey, take it easy, Willow. Xander is not in any immediate danger. I saw him leave school. He's probably safe at home right now.
xander_harris Ah! Blayne!
blayne_moll Oh, God! Oh, God!
xander_harris Are you all right?
blayne_moll Oh, God! You gotta get me outta here! You gotta! She, she, she gets you, and, uh...
xander_harris What?
blayne_moll ...she, she...
xander_harris What does she do?
blayne_moll Oh, God! Oh, oh, no!
xander_harris Blayne! What does she do?
blayne_moll She, she... she, she takes you outta the cage, and she ties you up, and, and... she... she starts movin', and throbbin', and these eggs come shootin' out of her! And then...
xander_harris What?
blayne_moll And then...
xander_harris Then what?
blayne_moll She mates with you!
xander_harris Sheeee...
blayne_moll That's not the worst part!
xander_harris That's not?
blayne_moll You seen her teeth? Right while she's, you know, right in the middle of... I saw her do it! I don't wanna die like that!
xander_harris Blayne! Blayne! Chill! It's okay. It's gonna be okay. We'll get outta this.
blayne_moll You gotta plan? What is it?
xander_harris Just, uh, let me perfect it!
blayne_moll Oh, God... Oh, God... Oh, God...
rupert_giles I-I understand, Carlyle. Yes... I-I'll take every precaution. Uh, absolutely, i-i-it sounds exactly like the creature you described. Y-you were right all along about everything. Well, n-no, you weren't right about your mother coming back as a Pekinese, but... uh... Try to rest, old man. Yes... Ta! Bye now!
rupert_giles Dr. Ferris Carlyle spent years transcribing a lost pre-Germanic language. What he discovered he kept to himself until several teenage boys were murdered in the Cotswolds. Then he went hunting for it.
buffy_summers It being...
rupert_giles Uh, he calls her a She-Mantis. This type of creature, the Kleptes-Virgo, or, or virgin-thief, appears in, in many cultures. The Greek sirens, the Celtic sea maidens, who, who tore the living flesh from the bones of, um...
buffy_summers Giles, while we're young!
rupert_giles Uh, well, basically the, uh, the She-Mantis assumes the form of a beautiful woman and then lures innocent virgins back to her nest.
buffy_summers Virgins? Well, Xander's not a, uh... I mean, he's probably...
willow_rosenberg ...gonna die!
buffy_summers Okay, okay, so this thing is breeding and we need to find it and snuff it. Any tips on the snuffing part?
rupert_giles Uh, Carlyle recommends cleaving all body parts with a sharp blade.
buffy_summers Slice and Dice.
rupert_giles Well, whatever you do, it had better be certain and swift. This beast is extremely dangerous.
buffy_summers Well, your buddy Carlyle faced it, and he's still around.
rupert_giles Yes, in a straitjacket, howling his innards out day and night.
buffy_summers Okay, Admiral, way to inspire the troops!
rupert_giles Sorry...
willow_rosenberg Xander's not home! He told his mom he was going to his teacher's house to work on a science project. He didn't tell her where.
buffy_summers See if you can get her address off the substitute rolls. And you need to record bat sonar, and fast!
rupert_giles Bat sonar, right. What?
buffy_summers Bats eat them. The mantis hears sonar, its entire nervous system goes kaplooey.
rupert_giles Where am I gonna find the...
buffy_summers In the vid library? There're no books, but it's dark and musty, you'll feel right at home, go! I guess I'll handle the armory.
blayne_moll Don't do anything to make her mad!
blayne_moll Hey, alright, now I can get outta my cage! Into yours. What'd you do that for?
xander_harris A weapon!
blayne_moll I think you're gonna need it.
willow_rosenberg Getting the address.
buffy_summers Great! Giles?
rupert_giles Recording bat sonar is something soothingly akin to having one's teeth drilled.
buffy_summers Let's roll!
willow_rosenberg According to Miss French's personnel records, she was born in 1907. She's, like, 90 years old!
rupert_giles And extremely well preserved!
blayne_moll Oh, God! Uh, he did that, he broke the cage, take him, not me, take him!
rupert_giles What now, exactly? We can't just kick the door down.
buffy_summers Yeah, that *would* be wrong.
natalie_french Hello, dear! I thought I heard... Are you selling something? Because I'd like to help you out, but... You see, I'm on a fixed income.
buffy_summers I'm looking for Miss French.
natalie_french I'm Miss French.
buffy_summers Natalie French, the substitute biology teacher?
natalie_french Goodness, that's me! I taught for over thirty years. I retired in 1972.
buffy_summers I can't believe this! She used Miss French's records to get into the school. She could be anywhere!
natalie_french No, dear! I'm right here!
xander_harris What's she doing?
blayne_moll I think it's eeny, meeny, miney...
xander_harris Moe?
xander_harris I'm comin', I'm comin'.
willow_rosenberg What do we do now?
rupert_giles Abject prayer and supplication would spring to mind.
buffy_summers I saw her walking past this park with her grocery bags. She lives in this neighborhood.
willow_rosenberg I'm gonna start banging on doors.
buffy_summers Wait, no, we do *not* have time for that!
willow_rosenberg We have to do something!
buffy_summers We will.
buffy_summers I won't be long.
rupert_giles W... Buffy?
blayne_moll Oh, yeah, here it comes!
xander_harris What? What's happening?!
blayne_moll How do you like your eggs, bro, over easy or sunny side up?
xander_harris Eggs? She's gonna lay some...
natalie_french The California Mantis lays her eggs, and then finds a mate to fertilize them.
willow_rosenberg Come on, Buffy!
Claw_Guy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode04 You!
buffy_summers Me!
buffy_summers Come on! Come on, where is she? Which house is it? I know you're afraid of her, I saw you! Come on!
buffy_summers Come on. What? What is it? This is her, isn't it, this is her house? This is it! Better than radar!
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
natalie_french Kiss me! Kiss me!
xander_harris Can I just say one thing? HEEEELLLLP! HEEEELLLLP!
blayne_moll Uh, hey, o-over here, hello! In the cage!
buffy_summers Let him go!
blayne_moll Help me! Help me!
buffy_summers Get them outta here!
blayne_moll Hey, help me! Help me!
buffy_summers Remember Dr. Gregory? You scarfed his head? Yeah, well, he taught me, you do your homework, you learn stuff. Like what happens to your nervous system when you hear this!
Tape#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode04 ...extremely important to file not simply alphabetically...
buffy_summers Giles!
rupert_giles I-it's the wrong side!
buffy_summers Bat sonar. Makes your whole nervous system go to Hell. You can go there with it!
rupert_giles Well, I... I'd say it's deceased.
willow_rosenberg And dissected.
xander_harris You okay?
buffy_summers Yeah.
xander_harris Just for the record, you were right, I'm an idiot, and God bless you!
xander_harris And thank you guys, too.
blayne_moll Yeah, really!
rupert_giles Pleasure...
willow_rosenberg I'm really glad you're okay. It's so unfair how she only went after virgins.
xander_harris What?
willow_rosenberg I mean, here you guys are, doing the right thing, the smart thing, when a lot of other boys your age...
blayne_moll Flag down on that play, babe. I am *not*...
rupert_giles Well, you see, that's the She-Mantis' modus operandi. Uh, she only preys on the pure.
xander_harris Well, isn't this a perfect ending to a wonderful day!
blayne_moll My dad's a lawyer. Anyone repeats this to anybody, they're gonna find themselves facing a lawsuit.
xander_harris Blayne! Shut up!
willow_rosenberg I don't think it's bad, I think it's really...
willow_rosenberg ...sweet! It's certainly nothing I'll ever bring up again.
angel I heard a rumor there was, uh, one less vampire walking around making a nuisance of himself.
buffy_summers There is. Guess I should thank you for the tip.
angel Pleasure's mine.
buffy_summers Course, it would make things easier if I knew how to get in touch with you.
angel I'll be around.
buffy_summers Or who you were?
buffy_summers Well... Anyway, you can have your jacket back.
angel It looks better on you.
buffy_summers Oh boy!

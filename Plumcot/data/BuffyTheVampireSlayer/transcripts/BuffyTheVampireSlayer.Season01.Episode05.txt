buffy_summers We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Buffy, and you're history!
rupert_giles Poor technique. Prioritizing, sub-par... Execution was adequate, but a bit too bloody for my taste.
buffy_summers Giles, don't mention it. It was my *pleasure* to make the world safe for humanity again.
rupert_giles I'm not saying that your methods are without merit, it's, uh, y-you're spending too much time and energy. It should simply be: plunge, and move on. Plunge and... Hello.
buffy_summers Oh, that's great! I kill 'em, you fence their stuff. What is it?
rupert_giles I don't know.
buffy_summers But it bothers you.
rupert_giles Yes! Well, I... I thought this vampire was just on a random kill, but it may be something else.
buffy_summers Something big?
rupert_giles Yes. I'd best consult my books.
the_master 'And there will be a time of crisis, of worlds hanging in the balance. And in this time shall come the Anointed, the Master's great warrior. And the Slayer will not know him, will not stop him, and he will lead her into Hell.' As it is written, so shall it be. 'Five will die, and from their ashes the Anointed shall rise. The Brethren of Aurelius shall greet him and usher him to his immortal destiny.' As it is written, so shall it be. 'And one of the brethren shall go out hunting the night before and get himself killed, because he couldn't wait to finish his job before he ate.' Oh, wait. That's not written anywhere. The Anointed will be my greatest weapon against the Slayer! If you fail to bring him to me, if you allow that girl to stop you... Here endeth the lesson.
rupert_giles That symbol on the ring... I believe it's the rune for fidelity, but, uh, it doesn't connect with any of the sects that I've studied.
buffy_summers What about this? On the inside. It's a sun and three stars. Haven't we seen that somewhere?
rupert_giles Let me see. No, I-I don't think this, um, represents any...
buffy_summers Wait, it's right here. Sun and three stars. Yuck, check these guys out. Told you it looked familiar.
rupert_giles Oh, the Order of Aurelius. Yes, you're right.
buffy_summers Ooo, two points for the Slayer, while the Watcher has yet to score!
buffy_summers Oh! Owen! Hi!
rupert_giles What do you want?
owen_thurman A book?
rupert_giles Oh!
buffy_summers See, this is a school, and we have students, and they check out books, and then they learn things.
rupert_giles I was beginning to suspect that was a myth.
owen_thurman I lost my Emily. Dickinson. It's dumb, but I like her around. Kind of a security blanket.
buffy_summers I have something like that. Well, it's an actual blanket. Uh, and I don't really carry it around anym-more... So! Emily Dickens, huh? She's great!
owen_thurman Dickinson.
buffy_summers She's good also.
rupert_giles Poetry.
owen_thurman I didn't think I'd find you here.
buffy_summers W... Why not?
owen_thurman I, I didn't mean... I mean... I think you can read.
buffy_summers Thanks.
owen_thurman But you don't seem bookwormy. The type of person to lock themselves in a dark room with a lotta musty old books. Oh, and I've offended you.
buffy_summers No! No, I'm just surprised you gave any thought to what I'm like.
owen_thurman You shouldn't be.
buffy_summers Oh, well, I *love* books. I mean, I really *love* books.
owen_thurman What's this?
buffy_summers Not this one.
rupert_giles This one she doesn't love.
rupert_giles Oh, Emily Dickinson.
buffy_summers We're both fans.
rupert_giles Yes, uh, she's quite a good poet, I mean for a...
buffy_summers A girl?
rupert_giles For an American.
owen_thurman I'll, uh, see you in math... if I open my eyes at some point.
buffy_summers Cool...
rupert_giles The Order of Aurelius is a very old and venerated sect. If they're here, it's for a good reason.
buffy_summers That was Owen!
rupert_giles Yes, I remember.
buffy_summers Do you have any more copies of Emily Dickinson? I need one.
rupert_giles Buffy, while the mere fact of you wanting to check out a book would be grounds for a national holiday, I think we should focus on the problem at hand.
buffy_summers Right. I'm sorry, you're right. Vampires. Oh. Does this outfit make me look fat?
willow_rosenberg Owen Thurman was talking to you?
buffy_summers It's all true.
willow_rosenberg Wow! He hardly talks to anyone. He's solitary, mysterious... He can brood for forty minutes straight, I've clocked him.
buffy_summers He was so nice, it was eerie.
willow_rosenberg What did you guys have to talk about?
buffy_summers Emily Dickinson.
willow_rosenberg He reads Emily Dickinson? He's sensitive, yet manly! Well, wait, you've never even read her.
willow_rosenberg You vixen!
xander_harris Has anybody given any thought to what this green stuff is?
buffy_summers Hmm, I'm avoiding the subject.
xander_harris I think it's kale, or possibly string cheese. So, Buffy, how'd the slaying go last night?
buffy_summers Xander!
xander_harris I mean, how'd the *laying* go? No, I don't mean that either.
buffy_summers It went fine, thank you. There's some new hoidy-toidy vampire sect in town.
willow_rosenberg That's bad.
xander_harris Well, hey, they're bringing in the much needed tourist dollars. Ooo, look at Mr. Excitement.
buffy_summers Owen! He's all alone! Maybe somebody should sit with him.
willow_rosenberg Mm, just to be polite! Good luck!
xander_harris Okay, what just happened?
cordelia_chase Look, an empty seat!
buffy_summers Ooo! Ew...
owen_thurman Let me get that.
buffy_summers Thanks! Boy! Cordelia's hips are wider than I thought!
cordelia_chase Eh-heh!
owen_thurman At least you don't have to eat your Soylent Green.
cordelia_chase Owen, a bunch of us are loitering at the Bronze tonight. You there?
owen_thurman Who's all going?
cordelia_chase Well, um, I'm gonna be there.
owen_thurman Who else?
cordelia_chase You mean besides me?
owen_thurman Buffy, what about you?
buffy_summers What?
cordelia_chase No, no, no! She, uh, she doesn't like fun.
owen_thurman How 'bout we meet there at eight?
buffy_summers Yeah! Eight! There!
buffy_summers It's not that big a deal. It's just a bunch of people getting together.
willow_rosenberg It's a very big deal!
buffy_summers It's not!
willow_rosenberg It is. Tell her!
rupert_giles I'm afraid it's very big.
willow_rosenberg Thank you! Wait!
willow_rosenberg What are you talking about?
rupert_giles What are *you* talking about?
buffy_summers@willow_rosenberg Boys!
rupert_giles Yes, well, I'm talking about trouble. A violent and disturbing prophecy is about to be fulfilled.
buffy_summers The Order of Aurelius.
rupert_giles You were spot-on about the connection. I've looked at the writings of Aurelius himself, and he, he prophesied that the brethren of his order would come to the Master and bring him the Anointed.
willow_rosenberg Who's that?
rupert_giles Well, I-I don't know exactly, a-a-a-a warrior, but, but it says he will rise from the ashes of the Five on the evening of the thousandth day after the Advent of Septus.
buffy_summers Well, we'll be ready whenever it is.
rupert_giles Which is tonight.
buffy_summers Tonight, okay... Not okay! It can't be tonight!
rupert_giles My calculations are precise.
buffy_summers Nuh! They're bad calculations! Bad!
willow_rosenberg Buffy has a really important date.
buffy_summers Owen!
rupert_giles Alright, I-I'll just jump in my time machine, go back to the twelfth century and ask the vampires to postpone their ancient prophecy for a few days while you take in dinner and a show.
buffy_summers Okay, at this point you're abusing sarcasm.
rupert_giles Buffy, this is no ordinary vampire. But we have to stop him before he reaches the Master.
buffy_summers But... Cute guy! Teenager! Post-pubescent fantasies!
rupert_giles Those will just have to be put on hold! The dark forces are aligning against us, and we have a chance to beat them back. Tonight we go into battle!
rupert_giles Perhaps I miscalculated.
buffy_summers I'm thinking yes.
rupert_giles Well, you know what they say. Ninety percent of the vampire slaying game is, is waiting.
buffy_summers You couldn't have told me that ninety percent ago?
rupert_giles Well, we, we've certainly waited here long enough.
buffy_summers Besides, there aren't any fresh graves. Who's gonna rise?
rupert_giles Apparently no one tonight.
buffy_summers Then I can bail? I can go to the Bronze and find Owen?
rupert_giles Oh, very well then. Follow your hormones if you want. But I assume I don't have to warn you about the hazards of becoming personally involved with someone who's unaware of your unique condition.
buffy_summers Yeah, yeah, I read the back of the box.
rupert_giles If your identity as the Slayer is revealed it could put you and all those around you in grave danger.
buffy_summers Well, in that case I won't wear my button that says, 'I'm a Slayer. Ask me how!' Good night.
rupert_giles 'Five shall die, and from their ashes the Anointed shall rise.' I was sure it was tonight.
collin I went on an airplane.
andrew_wells A pale horse emerged with death as its rider. You will be judged. You will be judged.
andrew_wells That day's gonna bring fire. Fire comin' down! Judgment! Don't think you're ready, ready to look upon him. If there's sin in there, there's sin all around. It's a liquid. On that day there won't be anybody tellin' us what to do or why we're doin' it. You can't prepare. On that day...
van_driver Hey, you gotta sit down. Okay?
andrew_wells Are you willing to stand with the righteous?
van_driver Is everyone okay?
van_driver Are you all right? Can you move?
xander_harris So you just went home?
buffy_summers What was I supposed to do? Say to Owen, 'Sorry I was late, I was sitting in a cemetery with the librarian waiting for a vampire to rise so I could prevent an evil prophecy from coming to pass?'
xander_harris Or flat tire?
buffy_summers I can't take this anymore. I feel like everyone is staring at me, the big, hideous, dateless monster. What? Yeah, that's right, I have no life, c'mon, nothin' to see here, pal, move it along!
xander_harris You're acting a little overly, aren't you? I mean, you could have any guy in school.
buffy_summers He's not any guy. He's more... Oweny.
xander_harris Sure, he's got a certain Owenosity, but that's not hard to find. I mean, a lotta guys read. I can read.
owen_thurman Hey, Buffy!
buffy_summers Owen!
xander_harris Oh, look, it's Owen. Buffy and Owen. And Xander. That'd be me.
owen_thurman W-where were you last night?
buffy_summers Oh. Well, um, my watch broke and we don't have any clocks in our house and so I didn't know what time it was or even what day it was...
owen_thurman I thought I was the only one that happened to. How 'bout we try it again for tonight? I'll even lend you my watch.
buffy_summers Tonight? Y-you and me?
owen_thurman Well, we could invite the chess club, but they drink and they start fights...
buffy_summers Oh, no, it's just... Well, I... sort of heard that... you and Cordelia were... somewhat... all over each other. A little...
owen_thurman I danced with her a couple of times. She's kinda grabby.
buffy_summers Oh, well, let's see, if I rearrange that, and I push that to n... Sure! Tonight'll work!
owen_thurman Great! I'll pick you up at seven?
buffy_summers Um, seven!
owen_thurman That's when the little hand's there.
buffy_summers Oh! Between the six and the eight.
owen_thurman Um, I'll see you then!
buffy_summers Tonight! Isn't that so?
xander_harris What?
buffy_summers Me and Owen!
xander_harris Yeah, so it is. It sure is so.
buffy_summers Hey, how's it going?
rupert_giles Uh, alright.
buffy_summers That's great! I see we're still working on that Anointed One problem, that'll probably take you a few days, right? I mean, that's one obscure prophecy...
rupert_giles Well, yes, there are a few interpretations...
buffy_summers So tonight's looking slow, right? Probably best to relax and regroup, no big disasters coming, that is *so* good, I will see you tomorrow then! Bye!
rupert_giles She is the strangest girl.
the_master You have done well. Everything is in place. When this night's work is done, I will have a mighty ally. I'll be one step closer to freeing myself from this... mystical prison. I've been trapped down here so long I've nearly forgotten what it's like on the surface. Well, there'll be time enough to remember... when I rule it! If she tries to stop you, kill her. Give your own lives, but do not fail to bring the Anointed. I know you won't disappoint me. Bug!
willow_rosenberg Pick!
buffy_summers Okay, do I wanna appear shy, coy and naive or unrestrained, insatiable and aggressive?
xander_harris Uh, y'know, Owen is a little home spun, he probably doesn't like that overly assertive look. Oh, hey, here's something. A nice comfy overcoat and a ski cap! The earflaps will bring out your eyes!
buffy_summers Maybe I should mix and match. Okay, guy's opinion. Which one do you think Owen will like better? The red or the peach?
xander_harris Oh, you mean for kissing you and then telling all his friends how easy you are so the whole school loses respect for you and then talks behind your back? The red's fine.
buffy_summers Thanks. I'll go with the peach.
willow_rosenberg Here, put this on.
xander_harris You're not bothering me!
willow_rosenberg So, where's he taking you?
buffy_summers Oh, I don't know. Where do you suppose young kids go on dates these days?
willow_rosenberg Well, I read somewhere once that sometimes they go to movies.
buffy_summers Movies! Interesting!
willow_rosenberg And I saw on TV once, a bunch of people our age went to a party.
buffy_summers Wow! I never knew being a teenager was so full of possibilities!
buffy_summers That's Owen!
buffy_summers That's Giles.
rupert_giles We need to talk.
buffy_summers Buffy's not home.
rupert_giles My calculations may not have been as far off as I thought.
buffy_summers 'Five Die in Van Accident'?
rupert_giles Out of the ashes of five shall rise the one. That's the prophecy. Five people have died!
buffy_summers In a car crash.
rupert_giles I know it doesn't quite follow, but, but it's worth investigating. Look! Among the dead was Andrew Borba, whom the police sought for questioning in a double murder. Now, he may be the Anointed One. The, the bodies have been taken to, to Sunnydale Funeral Home, w-we can...
buffy_summers Giles, why do you wanna hurt me?
rupert_giles I beg your pardon?
owen_thurman Hey! Uh, hi!
rupert_giles You have a date?
buffy_summers Yes, but I will return those overdue books by tomorrow.
rupert_giles Wait, you're not getting off that easily.
owen_thurman Man, you really care about your work!
willow_rosenberg Uh, Owen?
xander_harris Yeah, a couple of things about tonight.
rupert_giles Another date? Don't you ever do anything else?
buffy_summers This is the first date! There's never been a date, okay? This is my maiden voyage!
owen_thurman What, she doesn't like to dance?
xander_harris Well, it's a little too late to do anything about that. Uh, you should probably know that Buffy doesn't like to be kissed. Actually she doesn't like to be touched.
willow_rosenberg Xander...
xander_harris As a matter of fact, don't even look at her.
buffy_summers We don't even know if this is anything.
rupert_giles No, we don't.
buffy_summers And I haven't had a day off in a while.
rupert_giles True...
buffy_summers And a cranky Slayer is a careless Slayer!
rupert_giles Buffy, maintaining a normal social life as a Slayer... i-i-is problematic at best.
buffy_summers This is the 90's. The 1990's, in point of fact, and I can do both. Clark Kent has a job. I just wanna go on a date.
rupert_giles Well, I, I suppose it was a fairly slim lead...
buffy_summers Thank you, thank you, thank you! And look, I won't go far, okay? If the apocalypse comes, beep me.
owen_thurman Is everything cool?
buffy_summers All set.
rupert_giles Yes, and, uh, you'll face a pretty hefty fine in the morning.
buffy_summers Well, bye. Don't wait up.
willow_rosenberg Is something going on?
rupert_giles Oh, uh, probably not, no. I, uh, I suppose I'll just, uh, go to the funeral home in case, just see if anything comes up.
willow_rosenberg This is bad.
xander_harris I wish it was just bad.
willow_rosenberg We should... go along.
xander_harris Yeah, you're right. I don't trust that Owen guy. It's the eyes. Crazy!
willow_rosenberg Xander, we should go with Giles! He could get in trouble!
xander_harris Oh, he's gone, uh, it's, he's gonna be alright. He's like super librarian, y'know? Everyone forgets, Willow, that knowledge is the ultimate weapon.
owen_thurman The thing about Emily Dickinson I love is, is she's just so incredibly morbid. A lot of loss, a lot of death... It gets me. With a lot about bees, for some reason.
buffy_summers Did she have a tragic and romantic life? With a lotta bees?
owen_thurman Quiet. Kind of sequestered and uneventful. Which I can really relate to. I... don't get out much.
buffy_summers I don't get that.
owen_thurman It's my fault. I just find most girls pretty frivolous. I mean, there's a lot more important things in life than dating, y'know? Oh. Did I say something wrong?
buffy_summers Uh, no! Come on.
owen_thurman It's weird.
buffy_summers What is?
owen_thurman You! One minute you're right there. I've got you figured. The next, it's like you're two people.
buffy_summers Really? Which one do you like better?
owen_thurman I'll let you know.
cordelia_chase Aren't there laws against this sort of thing? Owen! Look at you, here all alone...
owen_thurman Cordelia, I'm here with Buffy.
cordelia_chase Oh! Okay. Do you wanna dance?
owen_thurman No, I'm still here with Buffy.
cordelia_chase You are so good to help the needy.
buffy_summers Cordelia, Owen and I would like to be alone right now, and for that to happen, you would have to go somewhere that's away.
cordelia_chase Well, when you're ready for the big leagues, let me know.
rupert_giles Damn!
owen_thurman Are you, uh, having fun?
buffy_summers Yeah. I almost feel like a girl.
rupert_giles AH!
willow_rosenberg Giles, it's us!
rupert_giles What are you doing here?
xander_harris We saw two guys going in after you. Are they...
rupert_giles They are! Uh, listen, you should get to safety.
willow_rosenberg Can you get out this window?
rupert_giles I'm afraid not.
xander_harris Look, I hate to state the obvious, but this looks like a job for Buffy?
rupert_giles Uh, she has her, her... beeping thing! Um, no phone, of course.
xander_harris Look, we'll get her, just, uh, hang in there.
rupert_giles Do hurry.
owen_thurman Do you want something to eat?
buffy_summers Sure. Just make it something fattening.
cordelia_chase What a disgusting display. Is that really appropriate behavior in a public forum? I mean, I've never seen a girl throw herself at a guy like that. Uhhh!
cordelia_chase Ooo! Hello, salty goodness! Pick up the phone, call 911. That boy is gonna need some serious oxygen after I'm through with him.
angel Buffy.
buffy_summers Angel.
cordelia_chase Why is this happening to me?
angel I was hoping I'd find you here.
buffy_summers You were?
angel Some serious stuff happening tonight. You need to be out there.
buffy_summers No, not you, too.
angel What do you know?
buffy_summers Prophecy, Anointed One, yada, yada, yada...
angel So you know. Fine. I just thought I'd warn you.
buffy_summers Warn me? You see that guy over there at the bar? He came here to be with me.
angel You're here on a date?
buffy_summers Yes! Why is it such a shock to everyone?
owen_thurman Here you go.
buffy_summers Oh. Um, Owen, this is Angel. Angel, this is Owen. Who is my date.
angel Hey.
owen_thurman Hey! So. Where do you know Buffy from?
angel Work.
owen_thurman You work?
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
owen_thurman Look at this! You show up everywhere. Interesting.
xander_harris You don't know the half of it. What's he doing here?
angel I guess it's the same thing you're doin' here.
buffy_summers Uh, excuse me, what are *any* of you doing here?
xander_harris Look, we gotta get to, uh... Uhhhh. We thought it'd be fun if, uh, we made this a double date!
buffy_summers I didn't know you guys were seeing each other.
willow_rosenberg Oh, yeah, well, we knew it would happen eventually, so we figured, hey! Why fight it?
owen_thurman And you guys are thinking double?
xander_harris 'Cause of... ...the fun!
owen_thurman And you're here because of work?
xander_harris Hey, maybe we should all go somewhere together.
buffy_summers Gee, that's so nice of you to ask, but Owen and I were, well, sort of... Owen and I.
xander_harris You know what'd be cool? The Sunnydale Funeral Home!
willow_rosenberg I've always wanted to go there!
buffy_summers The funeral home?
owen_thurman Actually, that sounds kinda cool! Do you think we could all sneak in?
xander_harris We saw some guys in there before. They seemed to be having fun!
buffy_summers Bite me!
buffy_summers Um, Owen, I gotta go.
owen_thurman I thought we were going to the funeral home.
buffy_summers No, you can't. I'll tell you what. I'll be back in a little while.
owen_thurman Buffy... What's the deal? Do you wanna bail on me?
buffy_summers No! No... no... uh... You remember when you said I was like two different people? Well, one of them has to go. But the other one is having a really, really good time, and will come back. I promise.
owen_thurman She's the strangest girl!
buffy_summers Which way?
willow_rosenberg The room's around back.
buffy_summers Damn it!
owen_thurman This is so cool!
buffy_summers Uh, Owen! You can't be here!
owen_thurman Oh, and I suppose you guys are allowed? What are we doin' here? Are we gonna see a dead body?
buffy_summers Possibly several. Guys, watch him.
owen_thurman Is she mad?
willow_rosenberg Oh, she just wants to make sure there're no guards so we don't get in trouble.
owen_thurman Good thinking.
xander_harris Good thinking.
buffy_summers Giles?
buffy_summers Giles!
rupert_giles It *is* you. Oh, good.
buffy_summers What happened?
rupert_giles Uh, two more of the brethren came in here. They came after me. But I was more than a match for them.
buffy_summers Meaning...?
rupert_giles I hid. Uh, this, uh, chap was good enough to bunk with me till they went away.
buffy_summers Well, w-were they here after you, or w-was it that prophecy thing?
rupert_giles Ah, well, that's what we have to find out. I don't know what these brethren mean to do exactly. Find the Anointed, or, or, or, or give him something perhaps, uh, it's all, all very vague. And the Anointed may be long gone!
buffy_summers But he may not be.
rupert_giles We must find out.
buffy_summers Okay, I just need to get Owen and the others out of harm's way first.
rupert_giles Owen? You brought a date?
buffy_summers I didn't bring him, he came.
rupert_giles Buffy, when I said you could slay vampires and have a social life, I didn't mean at the same time.
buffy_summers I know. I'll get rid of him.
rupert_giles Y-you can't make him go out there alone, we don't know where the brethren are. I-I'll just...
buffy_summers No! No, Giles, he sees you, he's gonna have more questions than he already does right now. I'll take care of it.
willow_rosenberg Is everything okay?
buffy_summers It is.
xander_harris And we'll be leaving?
owen_thurman We're not done lookin' around yet!
buffy_summers No, he's right. So let's find a nice, safe, fun room to look around in.
owen_thurman We tried the office here, but it's locked.
buffy_summers No it's not!
owen_thurman Well, I don't think we'll find much in here.
buffy_summers That's the plan.
owen_thurman Okay. What?
buffy_summers I have to go now. Um, to the bathroom, I have to go to the bathroom. If you hear anything, like a security guard or something, just be really quiet. And barricade the door.
buffy_summers Ewww, parts!
rupert_giles Keep looking, he must be here somewhere.
owen_thurman What are you guys doing?
willow_rosenberg Uh, just in case!
owen_thurman Oh, my!
buffy_summers Nothing.
rupert_giles The Anointed must be gone.
buffy_summers I guess. I mean, this is where they keep all the dead bodies, right?
rupert_giles Mm-hmm.
owen_thurman I read a lot about death, but... but I've... never really seen a dead body before.
owen_thurman Do they... usually move?
andrew_wells I have been judged!
owen_thurman What's goin' on?
buffy_summers Oh, no!
andrew_wells He is risen in me! He fills my head with song!
andrew_wells Pork and beans. Pork and beans!
xander_harris Gimme that!
andrew_wells I can smell you.
andrew_wells You're the chaff, unblessed. I'll suck the blood from your hearts, he says I may!
xander_harris He's in there!
buffy_summers Uh, go! Get out!
xander_harris She'll be okay. C'mon!
andrew_wells Shall we gather at the river? / The beautiful, the beautiful river?
willow_rosenberg I think he's coming this way!
owen_thurman Oh, God, this is too much!
buffy_summers What've you got?
rupert_giles What?
buffy_summers What'd you bring? Do you have a stake?
rupert_giles Oh, uh...
buffy_summers Thank you!
rupert_giles W-what should I do?
buffy_summers Um, go outside and make sure the others are okay.
rupert_giles Buffy!
owen_thurman Somebody's gotta help Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Owen!
andrew_wells They told me about you while I was sleeping.
andrew_wells Uh! Why does he hurt me?
owen_thurman Buffy!
owen_thurman No!
owen_thurman Did you see that? He tried to bite me! What a sissy!
buffy_summers No!
andrew_wells Dead! He was found wanting!
buffy_summers You killed my date!
willow_rosenberg Buffy! Owen's...
xander_harris J-just give her a sec!
buffy_summers You killed my date!
andrew_wells Your turn!
owen_thurman Does anyone have an aspirin? Or sixty?
buffy_summers Owen!
owen_thurman What happened to that guy?
buffy_summers Oh... We scared him away.
owen_thurman Oh, good. 'Cause, y'know, I would've...
buffy_summers I know. Here... I'm sure this isn't exactly what you had in mind for our first date.
owen_thurman Yeah! I was hoping maybe we'd finish at Ben & Jerry's.
buffy_summers We still could...
owen_thurman No, I, I, I think I'll just walk home. Uh, which way's home?
buffy_summers I'll get you there.
owen_thurman No, I'll, I'll go it alone.
xander_harris We'll make sure he gets home safely.
rupert_giles Buffy, if I might, uh...
buffy_summers Don't!
buffy_summers Well, did Owen say anything about me on the way home?
willow_rosenberg Oh, you mean specifically about you?
buffy_summers Or generally... i-in the area, in the ballpark, any sort of indication?
xander_harris Well, in that case, no.
willow_rosenberg But he was pretty incoherent, so we might've missed it.
buffy_summers You think?
xander_harris No.
buffy_summers I knew it. I totally blew it last night!
xander_harris No, see, what you need is a guy who already knows your deepest, darkest secrets and still says, 'Hey! I like that girl!' Someone like...
buffy_summers Owen!
willow_rosenberg Well, heh... This is our stop.
owen_thurman Hi.
buffy_summers Hi. This is going well.
owen_thurman I don't really know how to say this, but... about last night...
buffy_summers You don't even have to. I'm sure you were pretty freaked out.
owen_thurman Totally. And... I was wondering when I could see you again.
buffy_summers Um, that was my hopeful ear. Could you repeat that?
owen_thurman I think you're the coolest!
buffy_summers Really?
owen_thurman I mean, last night was incredible! I never thought nearly getting killed would make me feel so... alive!
buffy_summers So that's why you wanna be with me.
owen_thurman Oh, absolutely! When can we do something like that again?
buffy_summers Something like...
owen_thurman Like, walk downtown at three in the morning, a-and pick a fight in a bar. How about tonight?
buffy_summers Tonight would... be... not a workable thing. Did I just say that?
owen_thurman Tomorrow, then. I-I'm free any night this week.
buffy_summers I'm not. Please don't take this personally. It's not you, it's me.
owen_thurman Right. It's you.
buffy_summers And I was kinda hoping that... maybe you and I could still be...
owen_thurman I, I get it. You just wanna be friends.
buffy_summers That'd be nice.
owen_thurman Friends. Yeah. Great.
buffy_summers Yeah. Great.
rupert_giles I was ten years old when my father told me I was destined to be a Watcher. He was one, and his, uh, mother before him, and I was to be next.
buffy_summers Were you thrilled beyond all measure?
rupert_giles No, I had very definite plans about my future. I was going to be a fighter pilot. Or possibly a grocer. Well, uh... My father gave me a very tiresome speech about, uh, responsibility and sacrifice.
buffy_summers Sacrifice, huh?
rupert_giles Seems like a nice lad.
buffy_summers Yeah. But he wants to be danger man. You, Xander, Willow, you guys... you guys know the score, you're careful. Two days in my world and Owen really *would* get himself killed. Or I'd get him killed. Or someone else.
rupert_giles I, I went to the funeral home of my own free will.
buffy_summers And I should've been there.
rupert_giles Buffy...
buffy_summers I blew it!
rupert_giles I have volumes of lore, of prophecies, of predictions. But I don't have an instruction manual. We feel our way as we go along. And, I must say, as a Slayer, you're, you're doing... pretty well.
buffy_summers Well. At least I did stop that prophecy thing from coming true.
rupert_giles You did! Handily. No more Anointed One. And I would imagine the Master, wherever he is, is having a fairly bad day himself.
the_master 'And in this time will come the Anointed. And the Slayer will not know him. She will not stop him, and he will lead her into hell.' Welcome, my friend.

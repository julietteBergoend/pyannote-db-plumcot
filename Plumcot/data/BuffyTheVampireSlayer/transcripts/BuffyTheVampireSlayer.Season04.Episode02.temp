Buffy Wow, this music is so... so...
Kathy I know. This song is super fun. Isn't it?
Buffy You bet. It just gets fun-er and fun-er every time youplayit.
Kathy Going out?
Buffy Yeah. I'm seriously caffeine deprived. Figure I'dhead down to The Grotto and get a jolt and, you know, do some studying.
Kathy Oh. It's late... won't you be up all night?
Buffy Oh, yeah, but it's cool. I'msort of an 'up' kind of night person. I mentioned that right?
Kathy I guess I just didn't realize you'd be coming and going at allhours. Well, not that I mind. I'm just surprised.
Buffy I'll be quiet as a mouse, I promise. Ok.
Kathy Oh! Say, Buffy. I wanted to show you this littlesystem I implemented.
Buffy Oh, goody... system.
Kathy Just log every call you make in here and that way when the billcomes it won't be a problem. I figure, 'Stitch in time...'
Buffy '...catches the worm.'
Buffy You bet. Ok, then.
Kathy Also... I noticed that some ofmy milk was missing. Did you...
Buffy Oh! Yeah, actually, I did. I meant to...
Kathy No! It's totally ok, I was just wondering.
Buffy Yeah, I-I-I was making my coffee and I just...
Kathy Buffy, it's fine. I just wanted to make sure...
Kathy ...that we didn't have a thief or something.
Buffy Like who? Sid the Wiley Dairy Gnome?
Kathy I don't know, it's no big deal. Please, feel free.
Buffy Ok, I'm really sorry. I have to...
Kathy Have a good time.
Buffy Yeah, you too. With ironing.
Willow So you had trouble getting past Kathy?
Buffy Yep. She made big with the questions.
Willow And you thought your days of sneaking out of your room wereover.
Buffy No such luck. Kathy's nice and all, but she's... she'ssort of... I don't know, like, 'mini-mom of Momdonia.' Did you just hear something?
Willow I'm chewing my gum kinda loud.
Buffy That's not it.
Willow My sneakers are squeaky.
Buffy I'm looking for something lurky here, Will.
Willow Oh. Sorry, no.
Buffy Darn, I could use a little play tonight. Listening tothe best of VH-1 all day sort of put me on edge.
Willow Oh, Kathy's still spinnin' the divas?
Buffy 'Cause it's the fun-est! Well,no big. College is a time of change, right? I bet, before toolong, she'll be trip-hoppin' all over the place.
Willow Yeah! I mean, this whole dorm thing is just an adjustmentwe need to make. You know? I mean, my roomie is kind of challengingtoo.
Buffy And what are we if not women up to a challenge?
Willow Exactly! I mean, did we not put the 'grr' in girl? Well, here's where I get off.
Buffy Say 'hey' to Oz for me.
Willow Happy hunting.
Buffy Wish me monsters.
Buffy Will? Alright, why don't you quit hiding and come outand face me like a... thing.
Kathy Hey, I caught you.
Buffy Is everything ok?
Kathy Oh, everything's super. I just decided a decaf latte soundedlike heaven after all.
Buffy So you're coming along.
Kathy Why not? This way you won't have to walk these spookypaths alone.
Buffy Great! That's just great.
Kathy This is neat, isn't it? The fresh air, the trees, thesmell of...
Kathy What the blizzard was that all about?
Buffy Uh, he um... tried to take my backpack.
Kathy What were you thinking, taking him on like that?
Buffy Oh I, heh, I don't know, I guess I-I panicked.
Kathy I mean, it's just you could of gotten hurt or something. And look at my sweater, it's ruined!
Buffy Yeah, sorry about that. Here, w-we'll go get you cleanedup.
Demon1 She may be the one.
Demon2 We have to be sure. Follow her.
Demon1 As you wish.
Buffy Boring... boring... bill... bill...
Giles Hello.
Buffy You run?
Giles And jump. And bend. And, occasionally, frolic.
Buffy Ok, and, uh, what's with the motorbikeand scooter magazine?
Giles Congratulations, you've found me out. I'm a mod jogger.
Buffy Ok, you're not having one of those mid-life things, are you?'Cause I'm still going 'ick' from the last time you tried to recaptureyour youth.
Giles Buffy!
Buffy Sorry. Demon. Last night. Made with the pummeling, but he got away.
Giles What sort of demon?
Buffy Umm, had a cloak on, and glowing green eyes, and skin had a,like, super-bad fake rub-on tan.
Giles Translate?
Buffy Orange-y?
Giles Thank you. Anything else?
Buffy My roommate Kathy was there, but she didn't see anything.
Giles You took your roommate patrolling with you?
Buffy Well I invited the whole dorm, but she was the only one thatcould make it. I told her I was going for coffee and she decided to tagalong.
Giles Right. Well we should discourage her from that habit. From what you described I-I'm not familiar with the creature, but I-I'lllook into it and give you a ring when I've found something.
Buffy You know, it's nice out here.
Giles Yes, I take my tea out here sometimes.
Buffy What are you doing today?
Giles Uh, it's a good day for me, actually.A friend of mine recently acquired a-uh an original Gutenberg demonography...and it suddenly occurred to me that you've never once asked me what myday's plans were, which leads me to inquire whether you're feeling entirelyyourself.
Buffy That's not true. I ask about you all the time. Ok, well, maybe the words don't actually make it out of mymouth, but I think about it.
Giles And it's appreciated. Which doesn't explain why you'rehanging around here instead of rushing off as usual.
Buffy It's no big. I just figured I'd hang hereyou know—untilmy roommate goes to class.
Giles Ah, I see.
Buffy I know, it's probably just me having a bitch attack. Butit's not... me.
Giles Buffy, living with somebody is never easy. Especiallyfor an only child...
Buffy Giles, listen to me, ok? When she sharpens her pencilsshe measures them with a ruler to make sure they're all the same size.
Giles Which is fussy, I agree, but everybody has their idiosyncrasies. You'd do well to learn to tolerate them.
Buffy Or I'll end up an old lady who can only live with cats?
Giles Something like that. Buffy: Ok. You know what? You'reright. Take a mental pic, this is the new Buffy. Kinder, gentler... roommate extraordinaire.
Parker Ex-boyfriend? Or loan shark?
Buffy Excuse me?
Parker The person you're hiding from.
Buffy Oh... both. Ugly breakup. I'm sorry, I just cutyou...
Parker No, stay... stay. I'll watch your back. Freshman, huh?
Buffy Is it that obvious?
Parker There are signs. For instance, peoplewho've been around for awhile know how to use their dining hall card.
Buffy It's not for food?
Parker Work it right and you can get three meals worth, which equalsfewer punch cards used annually.
Buffy And more cash from dad which you get to keep for yourself.
Parker Right! The goal is to polish off as much as humanly possibleat one sitting. Enough to get you through the rest of the day, ifnecessary. While chipmunking items for future consumption.
Buffy Ahh, got it.
Parker Excess dry goods fit nicely in a backpack or your pocket. The wetter itemsmacaronies,your turkey loafthen you're into ziplocks. It's not for beginners.
Buffy I'll just take it slow.
Parker So.
Buffy So, those are my... are you...
Parker Oh, no, I have someone waiting. Otherwise I'd... heh,uh, Parker Abrams. I'm at Kresgehall.
Buffy Buffy Summers, Stevenson.
Parker Ok, well, I'll see you around Buffy Summers of Stevenson.
Buffy See ya, Parker Abrams.
Xander Hey, say hi to non-college guy.
Buffy Not that I mind, but don't non-college guys usually populatethe non-campus?
Xander Usually. I just thought I'd come around and check onmy girls.
Willow And eat off my plate.
Buffy What's the deal Xand, parents not feeding you?
Xander Sure they do, for a price.
Willow So, spill!What was that all about, with the cutie patootie?
Buffy I don't know... nothing big, I think. Just random adorableness.
Xander Oh, a technique I know well. Hit the girl with your bestshot, then hasta.
Oz Gotta respect the drive-by.
Xander Low rejection, fond memories.
Willow It looked like more than that to me. He got all googly-eyed.
Xander That's because he got hit by the Buffinator. Now he'spowerless.
Buffy You think?
Oz No question, he'll be back.
Xander So, what else is up with the Buff, any vamp action?
Buffy I did get jumped by a demon of non-specific origin last night.
Xander Yeah? Something apocalypse-y? Do we need to assemblethe scooby gang?
Buffy No, but thank you for asking.
Xander I just got way too excited, didn't I?
Buffy You just need to get out of the basement a little more there,Xand.
Kathy Hi, everybody. Squeeze in.
Buffy You all know my roomie, Kathy?
Willow Hi.
Oz Hey, Kath.
Buffy Is that my sweater?
Kathy I didn't think you'd mind, I mean you got mine all muddy.
Buffy I was saving you from a...
Willow Bear!
Buffy Mugger.
Kathy It's not a problem, is it? I mean, I figured we're almostlike sisters now, living together and everything.
Buffy No, it's... it's fine. I just wished you'd asked.
Xander So, where're you from, Kathy?
Kathy Nebraska, originally.
Xander Ahh, yes. Big sky country.
Buffy I mean, can you believe her? First she acts like she hassit privileges at my lunch table just because some computer had to makeus cellmates.
Willow I'm sure it's not easy for her. She's not like you, shedoesn't know anybody here.
Buffy Fine. But what about my sweater. You can't believethe stuff that I have to put up with.
Willow Yeah, I guess it's hard... uh... but I'm sure the sweater thingwas an accident.
Buffy I don't know Will... I think she's just coming back from thebathroom. I'll call you back.
Kathy Don't forget to log those calls.
Kathy Ewww! Who left their gum here?
Buffy Gum gnome?
Kathy It wasn't me! It had to be somebody, Buffy!
Buffy I don't know.
Kathy Do you always make that noise when you sleep?
Buffy So then after the scorpion, the demon opened my mouth and suckedsome kind of weird light out of me. A-and the worst part? Iwake up and there's Kathy, staring at me like I'm some kind of freak.
Oz Well, actually, the worst part, I'd have to go with the demon poringthe blood down your throat.
Willow Me too, I would vote for that too.
Buffy But that's just a dream, and this Kathy thing is real. All she cared about was that her precious sleep had been disturbed.
Giles Perhaps it would be more productive to examine your dreams,um, determine there meaning.
Kathy You can read dreams? Neat.
Buffy Giles, Kathy. Kathy, Giles.
Willow He's our grown-up friend. N-not in a creepy way.
Giles Nice to meet you, Kathy.
Kathy Ditto. Maybe you could read the dream I had last night?There was, like, this monster, and he sat on me and did all this stuffto me.
Oz Stuff like, scorpions? And Bloody Mary minus the Mary?
Kathy That's it! How'd you know?
Oz Well, I'm a good guesser.
Buffy Me too, and I'm guessing that you need to be on your way toclass. Right, Kath?
Kathy Hmm hmm, sounds like somebody woke up on the wrong side of thebed this morning.
Buffy Hmm hmm, and guess what? You were next to it.
Kathy You know, I do need to dash. My whole schedule is offbecause someone kept me up all night. Well, it's been fun. Toodles.
Buffy Toodles.
Giles You know what this means...
Buffy Yes. Not only does she take my sweater, but now she hasto horn in on my dreams. She is the most ever mooch... Oh,I haven't even gotten to the floss.
Giles Buffy, focus, please? If Kathy and you are having thesame nightmares, chances are something happened to you both when you metthe demon in the woods.
Willow So we need to figure out if this ritual their dreaming abouthas some special use, or meaning.
Buffy Cool, you guys can dothe brain thing. I'm gonna go to class.
Oz Which could also be construed as the brain thing.
Buffy Not when you're minoring in 'Napping 101.'
Willow Ok, so that was the evil twin, right? 'Cause she wasbordering on Cordelia-esque.
Oz Well, she's definitely pushing the stress meter on this Kathy thing.
Giles I concur she's not, uh, herself, but, you know, uh, learningto live with someone can be a challenge.
Willow A-and she hasn't been sleeping.
Giles Right, then. Nothing to get to concerned about.Still, let me know if she, um...
Oz Hits the red zone?
Giles Yes.
Demon1 We were correct. She is the one.
Demon2 Good. I have prepared for the summoning of the greatone, Taparrich.
Parker Lots of popular artists don't get their dues. Madonna?Whitney?
Kathy That's so totally true.
Buffy Parker?
Parker Hey, uh, I just droppedby to say... that. Uh, and bring you... You know, to maximize your dining hall exports. They'reheavy duty.
Buffy Plus freezer guard! That's so...
Kathy Parker was just going to leave his number and go, butwe started talking. He's such a blast, and time just flew.
Buffy Time, really? How much time?
Parker Uh, I'm not sure, we sort of got caught up talking Red Wings.It turns out that Kathy's a closet hockey fan. I think it's the violence.
Kathy Quit it! I told you that was just between us.
Parker It could be the sweaty men.
Buffy If you two are going to rassle, do you mind taking it outside?I've got a lot of work to do.
Parker Sorry, I didn't realize.
Buffy Oh, Parker wait. Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Parker No, it's totally cool. I should go anyway.
Buffy Well, it was great of you to stop by, m-maybe we could do itanother time?
Parker Another time for sure. Bye, Kathy.
Kathy Bye, seeya.
Kathy It wouldn't have killed you to be nice, you know.
Buffy Looked like you were being nice enough for the both of us.
Kathy I wasn't moving in on your territory,if that's what you mean.
Buffy Right. Justlike you didn't destroy my sweater.
Kathy I'm cold.
Buffy Well I'm hot. Deal with it.
Kathy Do you know what your problem is, Buffy.
Buffy You?
Kathy Hardly. Your problem is you're spoiled. Maybe theworld revolved around you where you used to live, but it's share time now.
Buffy Share time, huh? Fine! I'll show you share time.
Oz You're worried about her.
Willow Yeah, both of them. I mean, what kind of demon runs aroundputting ookie blood dreams into people's heads. Like some kind ofnightmare fairy. It's not right.
Oz Well, I'm against it.
Willow And Buffy's completely being not herself. If it wasn'tfor this English paper I'd be there right now. Um, listening. Doing the girly best friend thing.
Oz Well, I can do that.
Willow You can?
Oz Well, I'm not saying we'll braid each others hairprobably—butI can hang with her, watch for signs she's going over the edge.
Willow You're the best. Oh, she's probably patrolling by now.Check around the science center. If you need me I'll be at thelibrary.
Buffy ...so then Kathy's like, 'It's share time.' And I'm like,'Oh yeah? Share this!'
Oz So, either you hit her, or you did your wacky mime routine forher.
Buffy Well, I didn't do either, actually. But she deserves it,don't you think?
Oz Nobody deserves a mime, Buffy.
Buffy Hmm, Kathy does. She deserves to be locked in an invisiblebox and blown away by an imaginary wind and... and...
Oz Forced to wear a binding unitard?
Buffy Yeah, the itchy kind, it's perfect.
Oz Just here to help.
Buffy Which I appreciate. But you've never come on routine patrolwith me before, Oz. So, what's the deal?
Oz Seemed more interesting than homework.
Buffy As long as it's an elective. I can handle myself alone,you know.
Oz Not in question.
Buffy Good. So then, I go into the refrigeratorright?andthe label queen has managed to put...
Oz Just a, just a thought, Buffy, but do you think all this rantingis scaring away potential demons?
Buffy You're right. Ooh! She's even affecting my work,now. She's the Titanic. She's a crawling black cancer.She's... other really bad things.
Oz On the plus side you've killed the bench, which was looking shifty.
Buffy This isn't funny, Oz. Something has to be done.
Oz Agreed.
Buffy I'm going to bed.
Kathy Oh, jeez.
Kathy I do what I can, but Buffy's difficult. She's secretive,for one thing, she comes in at all hours of the night, she leaves her gumall over the place.
Willow I-it sounds like things are rough, but don't you want to betalking to Buffy about this?
Kathy I would, but she is so touchy about all kinds of weird stuff.I mean sometimes I get the feeling that she is not quite normal. You know?
Willow Well, normal is relative. Right?
Kathy Later, ok?
Buffy Why were you talking to her?
Willow Buffy, come on, we were only just saying hi.
Kathy Yeah, that's what she wants you to think.
Willow Buffy, this has to stop. I mean I-I get it, I have asucky roomie, too. But you just have to deal.
Buffy You're right, I've been thinking a lot about this and it's clearto me now.
Willow Good, that's better.
Buffy Kathy's evil. I'm an evil fighter. It's simple...I'm gonna have to kill her.
Willow You have to kill her? Don't you think you could just switchrooms, or something?
Buffy Well I would, but it's not just me in danger from Kathy. Look.
Willow Toenails?
Buffy Evil toenails. I took them off the floor last night whenshe was in the bathroom. She thought I was asleep.
Willow Good thinking, 'cause in the middle of the night those toenailscould have attacked you and left little half-moon marks all over your body.
Buffy Don't be ridiculous. The point is I measured them beforeI fell asleep and again this morning, and they grew. After they werecut! That's a demon thing, she has to be eliminated.
Willow Of course. I-it makes sense, now. But you bettershow those bad puppies to Giles before you do anything just to be sure.
Buffy Absolutely. I don't want to do anything crazy.
Willow Uh, you hurry on to Giles. I'll hang here and-and keepan eye on Kathy.
Buffy Great. Good. Thanks, Will.
Willow Giles, I-I just talked to Buffy and, yeah, I think she's feelinga little... insane. No, n-not bitchy crazy, more like homicidal maniaccrazy. So I told her to come to you. Kay?
Buffy Giles? Anybody home? Hello?
Buffy What are you guys doing? This is... this is ridiculous.
Xander Buffy, this hurts me more than it hurts you.
Buffy Not yet, but it will.
Xander Don't say that.Oh, PLEASE don't say that.
Giles We're doing this to stop you from making a terrible mistake.
Giles Clearly something is amiss.
Buffy Yeah, something's amiss here, a 'Miss Kathy Newman.' Giles,ow, Giles look in my bag. Look in the bottompocket of my bag. She has parts that can grow afterthey're detached. She irons her jeans. She's evil. She has to be destroyed.
Giles I fear the demon that Buffy met inthe woods has somehow possessed her.
Buffy Lite FM. Love songs. Nothing but love songs.
Xander You think?
Giles Um, you stay and watch her. I-I know a spell that willmake the possessing demon reveal itself so that we can fight it, but I-Ineed to get some supplies from the magic shop. Buffy, I... See youaround.
Willow Can I come in?
Kathy Sure. Where's Buffy?
Willow I don't know, exactly. But I've been thinking, it mightbe a good idea for you and Buffy to give each other some apart time. In fact, you might want to be, uh, apart before she gets back.
Kathy What do you mean? I should leave the room? Why shouldI go?
Willow I-it's not fair, I know.
Kathy You bet it's not fair, having to live with someone who's obviouslytroubled. Someone who so clearly needs to be in a home, not in adorm.
Willow I don't know about that. Uh, Buffy's going through something,yes, but...
Kathy I wouldn't put it past her to drop out, or take off or something. Do something horrible to herself.
Willow Herself?
Kathy Or worse. She's capable of it, you know? You cansee it in those shifty little eyes of hers. One of these days shemight even push somebody too far.
Kathy Hello? It's Oz.
Willow Hi. You did? She's at Giles, uh, ok. You know, during that reallyshort phone call I realized you are so right. I mean, it's not fairto make you leave your own room. So, you're good. You juststay, right there. Kay?
Buffy I can't believe this, after all that we've been through togetherand you guys won't believe me when I tell you that Kathy is bad.
Xander We want to, Buff, it's just...
Oz Shh, don't engage.
Xander I don't know if I tightened those ropes enough.
Oz Then we'd better go over there and check 'em.
Xander Oh, dear god!
Xander Avoid the legs. Avoid the legs.
Buffy Nope, not tight enough.
Buffy Kathy.
Kathy Buffy.
Buffy I think we need to talk, don't you?
Kathy Absolutely. Let's talk.
Buffy Oops, look what I did.
Kathy Huh, look what I did.
Buffy I knew it!
Taparrich Where is she?
Kathy Quit it!
Buffy I knew it! I knew you were one of those demon things.
Kathy Oh why don't you just stuff it and let me finish my ritual.
Buffy Ritual?
Giles 'The ritual of Mok'tagar, a race of trans-dimensional demons,involves the forced ingestion of animal blood while the victim slumbers.' Buffy's nightmares...
Buffy ...were real.
Kathy I'm sorry, ok? I left my dimension to go to college andthey sent these guys after me.
Giles 'But while the Mok'tagar can assume many forms and guises, includinghuman, they can always be recognized by others of their kind due to thelack of a soul.'
Kathy ...so I'm borrowing yours.
Buffy Without even asking.
Kathy Tonight, when they come looking for me, they'll take the onewithout a soul.
Buffy Well, thank God I won't have to watch you floss anymore.
Kathy And I won't have to live with a slob.
Kathy It's share time, Buffy.
Buffy Fine, let's start with my sweater.
Buffy Oh!
Xander Oow... why couldn't Giles have shackles like any self respectingbachelor?
Willow Guys, I just saw Kathy and she's acting... Oh my God, are youok?
Oz Yeah, Buffy's got a pretty good lead on us, though.
Willow I-I'll call Kathy, tell her to get out of there.
Kathy All you had to do was write down calls!
Willow No answer.
Giles Toenails! Buffy was right. Kathy's toenails notonly keep growing after they've been cut, they actually regenerate afterthey've been destroyed.
Willow And that's a demon thing?
Giles Oh, unequivocally yes. So... where is Buffy? Oh dear, we have even less time than I feared. I've looked upall known regenerating demons. Only one species practices the ritualBuffy's been seeing in her sleep. It's used to steal the soul froma human body.
Xander W-wait, are you saying that Buffy's been doing a Linda Blairon us because Kathy's been sucking her soul?
Giles I believe so, yes. Excuse me please.
Willow So Buffy was right all along. Later on, big remorse.
Giles Now, I've found a spell that should reverse the soul transferprocedure immediately. Willow and Iwill perform it at once.
Oz Leaving Xander and me to help Buffy in the flesh.
Giles 'Hear me, elders of the upper reaches... elders of the lowerreaches... elders of the dry land... elders of the river flats.'
Buffy Ah-hah!
Student Do you mind? People are trying to study!
Giles 'Ancients I beseech you. The soul, abstracted. Letit revert to it's true seat.'
Kathy The window's open. Happy?
Kathy Open up! Let me finish!
Giles 'Let it be finished. Let the unnatural vessel be emptied,let the essence be returned to it's original host.'
Kathy How did you do...
Taparrich There you are. Do you have any idea how much troubleyou're in young lady?
Kathy I'm not going back!
Taparrich Don't take that tone with me.
Kathy I'm 3000 years old! When are you going to stop treatingme like I'm 900?
Taparrich Enough. You're coming home.
Willow How's that?
Buffy Uh-uh, a little to the left... there. Perfect. I'mso glad you're here Will. I can already feel all that bad-Kathy-karma just draining away.
Willow About thatThe Kathy thing?I'm sorry I doubted you.
Buffy You're completely forgiven. I mean, you had reason todoubt. Except for the soul sucking thing I bet Kathy was pretty regular,as far as roomies go.
Willow That's a pretty big 'except.'
Buffy I guess. I'm just glad that it was Kathy's demon-y waysmaking me no-fun Buffy. I've always thought I was pretty easy goingyouknow?it's not like I have the big issues. You know, burn incense,or...
Willow You going to finish this?

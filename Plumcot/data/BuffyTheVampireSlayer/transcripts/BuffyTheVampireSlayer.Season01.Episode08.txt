buffy_summers Oh, great! A book!
rupert_giles Oh, uh, I, uh... haven't gone through the new arrivals. Uh, put it in, uh, in, in that pile.
dave Here, I'll get it.
buffy_summers Oh, thanks, Dave. The Willow pile.
rupert_giles Uh, when I've examined it, you can, uh, uh, skim it.
jenny_calendar Scan it, Rupert. That's scan it.
rupert_giles Of course.
jenny_calendar Oh, I know, our ways are strange to you, but soon you will join us in the 20th century. With three whole years to spare!
rupert_giles Ms. Calendar, I'm sure your computer science class is fascinating, but I happen to believe that one can survive in modern society without being a slave to the, um, idiot box.
jenny_calendar That's TV. The idiot box is TV. This is the *good* box!
rupert_giles I still prefer a good book.
fritz The printed page is obsolete. Information isn't bound up anymore. It's an entity. The only reality is virtual. If you're not jacked in, you're not alive.
jenny_calendar Thank you, Fritz, for making us all sound like crazy people. Fritz, Fritz comes on a little strong, but he does have a point. You know, for the last two years more e-mail was sent than regular mail.
rupert_giles Oh...
jenny_calendar More digitized information went across phone lines than conversation.
rupert_giles That is a fact that I regard with genuine horror.
jenny_calendar I'll bet it is. Alright, guys, let's wrap it up for today.
willow_rosenberg I've just got a few more. I'll hang for a bit.
jenny_calendar Cool! Thanks.
willow_rosenberg Xander, you wanna stay and help me?
xander_harris Are you kidding?
willow_rosenberg Yes, it was a joke I made up.
xander_harris Willow, I love you, but bye!
willow_rosenberg See you tomorrow!
xander_harris Buffy, wait up!
rupert_giles I'm, I'm just gonna stay and clean up a little. I'll, uh, I'll be back in the middle ages.
jenny_calendar Did you ever leave?
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 Where am I?
buffy_summers Willow! Willow, hey, wait up!
willow_rosenberg Oh, Buffy, I didn't even see you.
buffy_summers Or hear me. What was up last night? I tried your line, like, a million times.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I was, I was talking.
buffy_summers Talking to...? Okay, that's it, you have a secret, and that's not allowed.
willow_rosenberg Why not?
buffy_summers 'Cause... there's a rule.
willow_rosenberg Well, I sort of met someone.
buffy_summers I knew it! This is so important! When did you meet?
willow_rosenberg Last week after we did the scanning project in the library.
buffy_summers Does he go here? What's his name? Have you kissed him? What's he like?
willow_rosenberg No, Malcolm, no, and very nice.
buffy_summers You are a thing of evil for not telling me this right away!
willow_rosenberg Well, I wasn't sure there was anything to tell. But last night, oh! We talked all night, it was amazing. He's so smart, Buffy, and, and he's romantic, and we agree about everything!
buffy_summers What's he look like?
willow_rosenberg I don't know!
dave Yes, I will. I promise.
buffy_summers So, you've been seeing a guy, and you don't know what he looks like? Okay, this is a puzzle. No, wait, I'm good at these. Does it involve a midget and a block of ice?
willow_rosenberg I met him online.
buffy_summers On line for what?
buffy_summers Oh!
jenny_calendar Morning, kids!
jenny_calendar Buffy, are you supposed to be somewhere?
buffy_summers No, I have a free.
jenny_calendar Cool! But this is lab time, so let's make it a nice, short visit, okay?
buffy_summers Sure.
PC#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 You have mail.
willow_rosenberg It's him!
Message#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 I'm thinking of you.
willow_rosenberg He's so sweet!
buffy_summers He's a sweetie.
willow_rosenberg What should I write back?
buffy_summers Uh, Willow, I think it's really great that you have this cool pen pal, but don't you think you're kinda rushing all into this? Y'know what I mean?
willow_rosenberg 'I'm thinking of you, too!' No, that's incredibly stupid!
buffy_summers Will, down girl! Let's focus here, okay? What do you actually know about this guy?
willow_rosenberg Oh, see, I knew you'd react like this.
buffy_summers Like what?
buffy_summers I just wanna make sure you're careful, that's all.
willow_rosenberg Buffy...
buffy_summers He could be different than you think.
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 Watch her.
willow_rosenberg His name is Malcolm Black, he's eighteen, he lives in Elmwood, which is about eighty miles from here, and he likes me!
buffy_summers Short, tall, skinny, fat?
willow_rosenberg Why does everything have to be about looks?
buffy_summers Not everything, but some stuff is. I mean, what if you guys get really, really intense, and then you find out that he... has... a hairy back?
willow_rosenberg Well, no! Uh, he doesn't talk like somebody who would have a hairy back. And anyways, that stuff doesn't matter when you really care about each other. Maybe I'm not his ideal either.
buffy_summers Hey, I'm just trying to make sure that he's good enough for you. I think it's great that you met someone.
jenny_calendar Hey, Fritz... I'm, uh, lookin' at the logs. You and Dave are clockin' a pretty scary amount of computer time.
fritz New project.
jenny_calendar Ooo, will I be excited?
fritz You'll die.
boy This isn't my report! 'Nazi Germany was a model of a well ordered society'? I didn't write that! Who's been in my files?
xander_harris Hup, guess who?
willow_rosenberg Uh, Xander?
xander_harris Yeah, but keep guessing anyway.
willow_rosenberg Xander.
xander_harris Oh, I can't fool ya, you see right through my petty charade. We goin' to the Bronze tonight?
willow_rosenberg Not me, I think I'm gonna call it an early night.
xander_harris Oh, Malcolm, right? Yeah, I heard. But you're gonna be missin' out. I'm plannin' to be witty. I'm gonna make fun of all the people who won't talk to me.
willow_rosenberg That's nice. Have a good time!
buffy_summers She certainly looks perky.
xander_harris Yeah, color in the cheeks, bounce in the step... I don't like it. It's not healthy. So, are you goin' to the Bronze tonight? Oh, probably not, you probably have some vampire slaying or some lame endeavor like that, don't you? Everyone deserts me.
buffy_summers Check out the jealous man!
xander_harris What are you talking about?
buffy_summers You're jealous.
xander_harris Of what?
buffy_summers Willow's got a thang, and Xander's left hanging.
xander_harris Oh, that's meaningless drivel. I'm not interested in Willow like that.
buffy_summers Yeah, but you got used to being the Belle of the Ball.
xander_harris No, it's just... this Malcolm guy? What's his deal? I mean, tell me you're not slightly wigged.
buffy_summers Okay, slightly. I mean, just not knowing what he's really like.
xander_harris Or who he really is. I mean, sure he says he's a high school student, but I can say I'm a high school student.
buffy_summers You are.
xander_harris Okay, but I can also say that I'm an elderly Dutch woman. Get me? I mean, who's to say I'm not if I'm in the elderly Dutch chat room?
buffy_summers I get your point! I get your point. Oh, this guy could be anybody. He could be weird, or crazy, or old, or... He could be a circus freak. He's probably a circus freak!
xander_harris Yeah. I mean, we read about it all the time. Y'know, people meet on the 'Net, they talk, they get together, have dinner, a show, horrible ax murder.
buffy_summers Willow ax murdered by a circus freak... Okay, okay, what do we do? What are we doing? Xander, you get me started! We are totally overreacting!
xander_harris But it's fun, isn't it?
fritz I'm jacked in. I'm jacked in. I'm jacked in.
fritz I'm jacked in.
buffy_summers Whoa! You're the Late Girl.
willow_rosenberg I overslept.
buffy_summers Till fifth period? Talkin' to Malcolm last night?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. What?
buffy_summers Nothing.
willow_rosenberg You're having an expression.
buffy_summers I'm not. But if I was, it'd be saying, 'This just isn't like you.'
willow_rosenberg Not like me to have a boyfriend?
buffy_summers He's boyfriendly?
willow_rosenberg I don't understand why you don't want me to have this. I mean, boys don't chase me around all the time. I thought you'd be happy for me.
buffy_summers I just want you to be sure. To meet him face to face. In daylight, in a crowded place with some friends. Y'know, before you become all... obsessive.
willow_rosenberg Malcolm and I really care about each other. Big deal if I blow off a couple classes.
buffy_summers I thought you said you overslept.
willow_rosenberg Malcolm said you wouldn't understand.
buffy_summers Malcolm was right.
buffy_summers Dave? Hey there, Dave. Anybody home?
dave Oh, what do you want?
buffy_summers I wanted to ask you something if you have a minute.
dave What is it?
buffy_summers Well, you're a computer geek... genius, and, uh, I sort of have a technical problem. If I wanted to find out something about someone, i-if someone e-mailed me, could I trace the letter?
dave Well, you could pull up somebody's profile based on their user name.
buffy_summers But they write the profile themselves, right? And so they could say anything they wanted.
dave True.
buffy_summers Wow! I had knowledge! Well, is there a way to find out exactly where a letter, an e-letter came from? I mean, the actual location of the computer?
dave That's a challenge.
buffy_summers 'Cause, you see, Willow's got this boyfriend, Malcolm, and to tell you the truth, I think...
dave Leave Willow alone.
buffy_summers What do you mean?
dave That's none of your business.
buffy_summers Dave, are you Malcolm?
dave Of course not.
buffy_summers Dave, what's going on?
dave Look, I'll talk to you later, okay? I've got work to do.
buffy_summers So do I.
buffy_summers I'm telling you, something is going on. It's not just Willow. Dave, Fritz, they're all wicked jumpy.
rupert_giles Those boys aren't sparklingly normal as it is.
buffy_summers Giles, trust me.
rupert_giles I-I do! I-I-I really don't know how to advise you. Things involved with a computer fill me with a childlike terror. Now, if it were a nice ogre or some such I'd be more in my element. Well, I-I suppose you could, um, tail Dave, see if he's up to something.
buffy_summers Follow Dave? What, in dark glasses and a trench coat? Please. I can work this out myself.
fritz She's too close. What do I do?
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 Kill her.
fritz Party.
buffy_summers Whatever Dave is into, it's large.
rupert_giles What was the name of this place?
buffy_summers It said CRD. But, I couldn't get close enough to see what it was.
xander_harris Calax Research and Development. It's a computer research lab. Third largest employer in Sunnydale till it closed down last year. What, I can't have information sometimes?
rupert_giles Well, it-it's just somewhat unprecedented.
xander_harris Well, my uncle used to work there. I-in a floor sweeping capacity.
buffy_summers But it closed?
xander_harris Uh-huh.
buffy_summers Looked pretty functional from where I stood. I don't have a clue what they were doing.
xander_harris And what do they need Dave for?
buffy_summers Something about computers, right? I mean, he is off-the-chart smart.
rupert_giles We still don't know an enormous amount. Whatever is going on there may be on the up-and-up.
xander_harris No, if CRD opened, it would've been on the news.
buffy_summers Besides, I can just tell something's wrong. My spider sense is tingling.
rupert_giles Your... spider sense?
buffy_summers Pop culture reference. Sorry.
rupert_giles Yes, well, ahem, I think we're still at a stand still. Uh, uh, short of breaking into the place, I don't see...
buffy_summers Breaking in! Then this is the plan!
xander_harris I'm free tonight!
buffy_summers Tonight it is!
rupert_giles A moment, please, of quiet reflection. I do not suggest that you illegally enter the...
rupert_giles ...data into the file so the book will be listed by title as well as by author.
jenny_calendar I just came by to check your new data base, make sure your cross reference table isn't glitching. 'Cause I'm guessing you haven't gone anywhere near it.
rupert_giles Uh, I'm still sorting through the chaos you left behind you.
jenny_calendar Hmm. You're here again? Kids really dig the library, don't cha?
buffy_summers We're literary!
xander_harris To read makes our speaking English good.
buffy_summers We'll be going now.
rupert_giles Uh, w-we'll, uh, continue this conversation at another time.
buffy_summers I think we're done. Makes our speaking English is good?
xander_harris I panicked, okay?
malcolm I've never felt this way about anyone before, Willow.
willow_rosenberg I know what you mean. I feel like you know me better than anyone.
malcolm I do.
willow_rosenberg Do you think we should... meet?
malcolm I think we should soon.
willow_rosenberg I'm nervous.
malcolm I'm not. Isn't that strange?
willow_rosenberg That's what Buffy doesn't understand, how comfortable you can make me feel.
malcolm Buffy just makes trouble. That's why she got kicked out of her old school.
willow_rosenberg How did you know that?
malcolm It's on her permanent record.
malcolm You must have mentioned it.
willow_rosenberg I guess.
malcolm Let's not worry about her anymore.
willow_rosenberg I have to sign off. I'll talk to you later.
malcolm Don't.
willow_rosenberg Bye.
jenny_calendar You're a snob!
rupert_giles I am no such thing.
jenny_calendar Oh, you are a *big* snob. You, you think that knowledge should be kept in these carefully guarded repositories where only a handful of white guys can get at it.
rupert_giles Nonsense! I simply don't adhere to a, a knee-jerk assumption that because something is new, it's better.
jenny_calendar This isn't a fad, Rupert! We are creating a new society here.
rupert_giles A society in which human interaction is all but obsolete? In which people can be completely manipulated by technology, well, well... Thank you, I'll pass.
jenny_calendar Well, ahem, I think you'll be very happy here with your musty, old books.
rupert_giles These musty old books have a great deal more to say than in any of your... fabulous web pages.
jenny_calendar Hmm. This one doesn't have a whole lot more to say.
jenny_calendar What is it, like a diary?
rupert_giles How odd. I haven't looked through all the volumes yet, I didn't, um...
jenny_calendar What is it?
rupert_giles Uh, nothing, um, a, a diary, yes. I imagine that's what it is. Well, it's been so nice talking to you.
jenny_calendar We were fighting.
rupert_giles Must do it again sometime, yes... Bye, now.
school_nurse I checked the computer, and there's nothing in his file about being allergic to penicillin!
dave Buffy!
buffy_summers Dave! How're you doing?
dave Okay. Uh, look, I'm sorry about yesterday. I haven't been getting much sleep lately, y'know?
buffy_summers Don't sweat it.
dave Willow was looking for you.
buffy_summers Good, I need to talk to her. Do you know where she is?
dave She said she'd be in the, in the girls' locker room.
buffy_summers Great. Thanks.
buffy_summers Will?
buffy_summers Willow?
buffy_summers Will? You taking a shower?
buffy_summers I guess not.
buffy_summers This is how droughts get started.
dave Buffy! Get out!
dave I can't do it! I'm not gonna do it.
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 But you promised.
dave Buffy isn't a threat to you! Stop with it.
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 The project is almost complete. You won't have to do it again.
dave Oh, I can't!
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 I've shown you a new world, Dave. Knowledge, power... I can give you everything. All I want is your love.
dave No. This isn't right. None of it is.
xander_harris I'm gonna kill Dave!
buffy_summers He tried to warn me.
xander_harris Warn you that he set you up? Is she gonna be okay?
rupert_giles She was only grounded for a moment. Still, if you'd been anyone but the Slayer...
buffy_summers Tell me the truth: how's my hair?
xander_harris It's great! It's your best hair ever!
rupert_giles Uh, oh, yes.
buffy_summers I just... I don't understand what would make Dave do a thing like that.
rupert_giles I think perhaps I do.
rupert_giles Does this look familiar to either of you?
buffy_summers Yeah, sure. Looks like a book.
xander_harris I knew that one.
rupert_giles In the dark ages the souls of demons were sometimes trapped in certain volumes. They remained locked within the book, harmless, unless the pages were read aloud. Unless I'm mistaken, this is Moloch, the Corrupter. A very deadly and seductive demon. He draws people to him with promises of love, power, knowledge. Preys on impressionable minds.
xander_harris Like Dave's.
rupert_giles Dave, and who knows how many others.
buffy_summers And Moloch is inside that book?
rupert_giles Not anymore.
xander_harris You released Moloch?
buffy_summers Way to go!
rupert_giles I didn't read it! That dreadful Calendar woman found it and, and it was already blank.
buffy_summers Okay, so a powerful demon with horns is walking around Sunnydale, and nobody's noticed?
xander_harris I-if he's so big and strong, why bother with Dave? I mean, why didn't he just attack Buffy himself?
rupert_giles I don't know. And I don't know who could've read that book. It wasn't even in English.
buffy_summers Where was it?
rupert_giles Uh, in a pile with others that were, um, uh, scanned.
xander_harris And that released the demon?
buffy_summers No, he's not out here. He's in there.
rupert_giles The scanner read the book. It brought Moloch out as information to be absorbed.
buffy_summers He's gone binary on us.
xander_harris Okay, for those of us in our studio audience, who are me? You guys are saying that Moloch is in this computer?
buffy_summers And every computer connected to it by a modem.
rupert_giles He's everywhere.
xander_harris What are we gonna do?
rupert_giles Willow scanned him into her file. It may be... a futile gesture, but I suggest we, um, uh, delete it.
buffy_summers Solid!
xander_harris Don't get too close.
buffy_summers Okay. Okay. So which file do you think it is? Willow? That's probably it, right? I'll just delete the whole thing.
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 Stay away from Willow! It is none of your business!
buffy_summers So that's what Malcolm looks like.
buffy_summers So much for delete file.
rupert_giles This is very bad.
xander_harris Are we overreacting? He's in a computer! What can he do?
buffy_summers You mean besides convince a perfectly nice kid to try and kill me? I don't know. How about mess up all the medical equipment in the world?
rupert_giles Randomize traffic signals.
buffy_summers Access launch codes for our nuclear missiles.
rupert_giles Destroy the world's economy.
buffy_summers I think I pretty much capped it with that nuclear missile thing.
rupert_giles Right, yours was best.
xander_harris Okay, he's a threat, I'm on board with that now. But what can we do about it?
buffy_summers I think the first thing we do is find Willow. She's probably talking to him right now. God, that creeps me out!
xander_harris What does he want with Willow?
buffy_summers Let's never find out. Okay, I'm gonna check the computer lab, and you guys call her home.
buffy_summers Willow?
xander_harris No answer.
rupert_giles Damn it!
xander_harris Well, it wasn't busy either, so she's not online.
xander_harris She's not home.
rupert_giles What did you find?
xander_harris Willow isn't...
buffy_summers Dave. He's dead.
rupert_giles How?
buffy_summers Well, it looks like suicide.
xander_harris With a little help from my friends?
buffy_summers I'd guess Fritz. Or the other zomboids from CRD. Okay, you and I are gonna go to Willow's house. Giles, you need to come up with a way to get Moloch out of the 'Net.
rupert_giles I, I have records of the ceremonies, but, but that's for a creature of the flesh. Th-this could be something completely different.
buffy_summers Then get Ms. Calendar. Maybe she can help you.
rupert_giles Well, even if she could, how am I gonna convince her that there's a demon on the Internet?
buffy_summers Okay, fine, then you can stay here and come up with a better plan. C'mon.
willow_rosenberg Mom? Dad?
PC#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 You have mail.
Message#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 No more waiting. I need you to see me.
PC#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 You have mail.
willow_rosenberg Dad, did you forget your keys again?
fritz No more waiting.
Radio#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 A spokesman for the archbishop denied the allegations, blaming computer error for the apparent financial discrepancy.
rupert_giles Binding rituals...
Radio#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 In Washington D.C., the FBI today reported that all of its serial killer profiles have been mysteriously downloaded from its central computer.
jenny_calendar Hi. I got your message. What's so urgent?
rupert_giles Um, thank you for coming. Uh, I need your help. But before that, um, I need you to believe something that, um, you may not want to. Uh, there's, uh... something's got into the, um... i-i-inside, um... There's a demon in the Internet.
jenny_calendar I know.
buffy_summers Willow?!
xander_harris This isn't good.
buffy_summers Willow?!
buffy_summers Willow?!
xander_harris Okay, any thoughts?
buffy_summers 'No more waiting, I need you to see me'? See him how? Where?
xander_harris What about CRD?
buffy_summers The research place?
xander_harris I'm guessing that's Moloch central.
buffy_summers Guessing that's our best lead. Let's just hope Giles can back us up.
rupert_giles You already know? How exactly is that?
jenny_calendar Come on, there've been portents for days. I mean, power surges, online shutdowns... You should see the bones I've been casting. I *knew* this would happen sooner or later. I mean, it's probably a, a mischief demon, y'know, like Kelkor, or...
rupert_giles It's Moloch.
jenny_calendar The Corrupter? Oh, boy. I shoulda remembered, I just don't...
rupert_giles Uh... You don't seem exactly surprised by... Who are you?
jenny_calendar I teach computer science at the local high school.
rupert_giles A profession that hardly lends itself to the casting of bones.
jenny_calendar Wrong and wrong, snobby. You think the realm of the mystical is limited to ancient texts and relics? That bad old science made the magic go away? Mm. The divine exists in cyberspace same as out here.
rupert_giles Are you a witch?
jenny_calendar Mm. I don't have that kinda power. 'Technopagan' is the term.
jenny_calendar There are more of us than you think.
rupert_giles Well, uh, you can definitely help me. Um... What's in cyberspace at the moment is less than divine.
rupert_giles I have the binding rituals at hand, but I'm completely out of my idiom.
jenny_calendar Well, I can help! I think... I hope, I mean, well, this is my first real... Do you know how he got in?
rupert_giles He was, uh, 'scanned' is the term, I believe.
jenny_calendar And you want him back in the book?
rupert_giles Buffy!
buffy_summers Yeah.
rupert_giles Willow?
buffy_summers Not at home. It looks like she was taken somewhere.
rupert_giles Where are you?
buffy_summers CRD. Whatever Moloch wants Willow for, it's probably in there.
rupert_giles Ms. Calendar and I are, uh, working to get Moloch offline.
buffy_summers Here's a tip: hurry!
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 Welcome, my love.
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 I can't tell you how good it is to see you...
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 ...with my own two eyes.
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 Willow.
willow_rosenberg Malcolm.
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 This world is so new, so exciting. I can see all of it. Everything flows through me. I know the secrets of your kings. But nothing compares to having form again. To be able to walk, to touch, to kill.
xander_harris Back way?
buffy_summers Back way.
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 Here they come.
jenny_calendar The first thing we have to do is form the circle of Kayless. Right?
rupert_giles Form a circle? But there's only two of us. That's really more of a line.
jenny_calendar You're not getting it, Rupert. We have to form the circle inside. I'm putting out a flash. I just hope enough of my group responds.
rupert_giles Won't Moloch just shut you down?
jenny_calendar Well, I'm betting he won't figure out what we're doing until it's too late.
rupert_giles Hoping and betting, that's what we've got.
jenny_calendar You wanna throw in praying? Be my guest.
willow_rosenberg I don't understand. What do you want from me?
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 I want to give you the world.
willow_rosenberg Why?
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 You created me. I brought these humans together to build me a body. But *you* gave me life. Took me out of the book that held me. I want to repay you.
willow_rosenberg By lying to me? By pretending to be a person? Pretending you loved me?
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 I do!
xander_harris Uh, Buffy!
buffy_summers It's her!
xander_harris Yeah, who's the other guy?
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 Don't you see? I can give you everything! I can control the world! Right now a man in Beijing is transferring money to a Swiss bank account for a contract on his mother's life. Good for him!
buffy_summers I can't bust it. It's heavy steel.
xander_harris Then let's find another way in.
xander_harris What's goin' on?
buffy_summers Building's security system is computerized.
xander_harris Whoops!
jenny_calendar Almost there.
rupert_giles Couldn't you just stop Moloch by, by entering some computer virus?
jenny_calendar You've seen way too many movies. Okay! We're up. You read, I type. Ready?
rupert_giles Uh, I am. By the power of the divine, by the essence of the word, I command you...
willow_rosenberg Let me leave?
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 But I love you!
willow_rosenberg Don't say that! That's a joke! You don't love anything!
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 You are mine!
willow_rosenberg I'm not yours! I'm never gonna be yours! Never!
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 Pity.
rupert_giles By the power of the circle of Kayless, I command you... Kayless, with a 'K'.
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 I'll miss you.
rupert_giles Demon, come!
rupert_giles I command you!
buffy_summers Ow... Guy's made of metal!
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 No! I won't go back!
rupert_giles Demon, COME!
xander_harris Hey! I got to hit someone!
jenny_calendar He's out of the 'Net. He's bound.
rupert_giles He's not in the book.
jenny_calendar He's not in the book. Well, where is he?
xander_harris Let's go this way!
buffy_summers Wait!
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 I was omnipotent. I was everything! Now I'm trapped in this shell!
willow_rosenberg Malcolm!
willow_rosenberg Remember me, your girlfriend?!
willow_rosenberg Well, I think it's time we break up!
willow_rosenberg Or maybe we can still be friends!
Moloch#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode08 This body's all I have left. But it's enough to crush you!
buffy_summers Take your best shot.
jenny_calendar Well, look who's here! Welcome to my world. You scared?
rupert_giles I'm remaining calm, thank you. Uh, I just wanted to, uh, return this. I found it among the new books, and naturally I thought of you.
jenny_calendar Cool. Thanks.
rupert_giles Uh, well, I'll, I'll see you anon.
jenny_calendar Can't get outta here fast enough, can you?
rupert_giles Truthfully, I'm even less anxious to be around computers than I used to be.
jenny_calendar Well, it was your book that started all the trouble, not a computer.
jenny_calendar Honestly, what is it about them that bothers you so much?
rupert_giles The smell.
jenny_calendar Computer's don't smell, Rupert.
rupert_giles I know! Smell is the most powerful trigger to the memory there is. A certain flower or a, a whiff of smoke can bring up experiences... long forgotten. Books smell. Musty and, and, and, and rich. The knowledge gained from a computer, is, uh, it... it has no, no texture, no, no context. It's, it's there and then it's gone. If it's to last, then, then the getting of knowledge should be, uh, tangible, it should be, um... smelly.
jenny_calendar Well! You really are an old-fashioned boy, aren't you?
rupert_giles Well, I-I don't dangle a corkscrew from my ear.
jenny_calendar That's not where I dangle it.
xander_harris We gonna go to the Bronze tonight? We three?
buffy_summers It'll be fun!
xander_harris Yeah, Willow, fun? Remember fun? That thing where you smile?
willow_rosenberg Oh, I'm sorry guys. I'm just thinking about...
buffy_summers Malcolm?
willow_rosenberg Malcolm, Moloch... whatever he's called. The one boy that's really liked me, and he's a demon robot. What does that say about me?
buffy_summers It doesn't say anything about you.
willow_rosenberg I mean, I thought I was really falling...
buffy_summers Hey, did you forget? The one boy I've had the hots for since I've moved here turned out to be a vampire.
xander_harris Right, and the teacher I had a crush on? Giant praying mantis?
willow_rosenberg That's true.
xander_harris Yeah, that's life on the Hellmouth.
buffy_summers Let's face it: none of us are ever gonna have a happy, normal relationship.
xander_harris We're doomed!
willow_rosenberg Yeah!

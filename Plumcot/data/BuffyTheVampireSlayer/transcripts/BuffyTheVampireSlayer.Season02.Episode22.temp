Officer#1 Freeze! Put your hands up. Back away from the girl slowly.
Buffy Look, I didn't do anything.
Officer#1 Do it! Now!
Officer#2 This one's dead.
Officer#1 What about up there?
Buffy Xander...
Officer#2 Get her out of here!
Buffy Wait! Just see if he's okay! Please!
Buffy Please. You don't understand.
Officer#1 You'd do well to keep your mouth shut, missy.
Buffy But I didn't *do* anything.
Snyder Why do I find that so very hard to believe?
Officer#1 In there. You know this girl?
Snyder Buffy Summers. If there's trouble, she's behind it.
Buffy You stupid little troll. You have *no* idea!
Snyder Attitude problem. Serious.
Buffy Look, I just wanna know if my friends are okay.
Officer#1 All right, that's enough.
Officer#1 You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and...
Officer#2 Stop!
Officer#2 Get down!
Officer#2 All units, we have a fugitive on foot at the high school. Homicide suspect. Female, blond, approximately sixteen years old. Suspect is *very* dangerous.
Buffy Xander! Ohhh...
Buffy I was so worried, I didn't know if you were okay. The cops were...
Xander Yeah, I, I heard them chase you out. I was just coming out of it. Souvenir.
Buffy Well, what about the others?
Buffy Are they okay?
Buffy Okay. That was about equal parts protecting me and copping a feel, right?
Buffy What is it?
Xander The doctor said it was head trauma. She can wake up at any time, but, um... the longer it lasts, the... less likely it is.
Buffy I never should've let her try to do that curse. Angel must've known.
Buffy Where are her parents?
Xander With relatives in Phoenix. I gave them a call. They're... they're getting on a plane back.
Buffy Does Oz know?
Xander Oh, man. Um... I didn't even think. Um... I'll call him.
Xander Hey.
Cordelia Hey.
Cordelia How is she? The doctor told me that...
Xander Yeah. We're, uh... still waiting.
Buffy You okay?
Cordelia I ran. I think I made it through three counties before I realized nobody was chasing me. Not too brave.
Buffy It was the right thing to do.
Xander Did Giles keep up with you?
Cordelia I didn't see Giles.
Buffy You mean he's not in the hospital?
Xander No.
Giles Mm... Ohhh...
Angelus Hi, Rupert. I wasn't sure you were gonna wake up. You had me worried.
Giles What do you want?
Angelus I wanna torture you. I used to love it, and it's been a *long* time. I mean, the last time I tortured somebody, they didn't even *have* chainsaws.
Angelus Oh, yeah. Acathla. He's an even harder guy to wake up than you are. I mean, I performed the rituals, said all the right phrases... blood on my hand. Got nothing. Big doughnut hole for my troubles. I figure you know the ritual. You're pretty up on these things. You could probably... tell me what I'm doing wrong. But honestly, I sorta hope you don't... 'Cause I *really* wanna torture you.
Joyce No. I-i-it's impossible. There... there's been some terrible mistake.
Det._Stein And you have no idea where your daughter is.
Joyce She said she was going to her friend Willow's house. Maybe she slept over.
Det._Stein Is that Willow Rosenberg?
Joyce Yes.
Det._Stein Second victim.
Joyce What?
Det._Stein Your daughter has a history of violence. Doesn't she, Ms. Summers?
Joyce Well...
Det._Stein You call us. Okay? If she decides to stop by. Be best if she just comes in.
Buffy Giles! Giles!
Whistler I don't think he's here.
Buffy Who are you?
Whistler Whistler.
Buffy What are you doing here?
Whistler I'm waiting for you.
Buffy Why?
Whistler 'Cause I-I-I need a date to the prom.
Buffy I have had a *really* bad day, okay? If you have information worth hearing, then I am grateful for it. If you're gonna crack jokes, then I'm gonna pull out your ribcage and wear it as a hat.
Whistler Hello to the imagery! Very nice. It wasn't supposed to go down like this. Nobody saw you coming. I figured this for Angel's big day. But I thought he was here to *stop* Acathla, not to bring him forth. Then you two made with the smoochies... now he's a creep again. Now, what are you gonna do? W-what are you prepared to do?
Buffy Whatever I have to.
Whistler Maybe I should ask, what are you prepared to give up?
Buffy You don't have anything useful to tell me, do you? What are you, just some immortal demon sent down to even the score between good and evil?
Whistler Wow. Good guess.
Buffy Well, why don't you try getting off your immortal ass and fighting evil once in a while? 'Cause I'm sick and tired of doing it myself.
Whistler In the end, you're always by yourself. You're all you've got. That's the point.
Buffy Spare me.
Whistler The sword isn't enough. You gotta be ready. You gotta know how to use it!
Officer#3 Hold right there!
Officer#3 Put your hands on your head! Do it!
Spike Hello, cutie.
Spike Now, you hold on a second!
Spike Hey! White flag here. I quit.
Buffy Let me clear this up for you. We're mortal enemies. We don't get time-outs.
Spike You want to go around, pet, I'll have a gay old time of it. You want to stop Angel... we're gonna have to play this a bit differently.
Buffy What are you talking about?
Spike I'm talking about your ex, pet. I'm talking about putting him in the bloody ground.
Buffy This has gotta be the *lamest* trick you guys have ever thought up.
Spike He's got your Watcher. Right now, he's probably torturing him.
Buffy What do you want?
Spike I told you. I want to stop Angel. I want to save the world.
Buffy Okay. You do remember that you're a vampire, right?
Spike We like to talk big. Vampires do. 'I'm going to destroy the world.' That's just tough guy talk. Strutting around with your friends over a pint of blood. The truth is, I like this world. You've got... dog racing, Manchester United. And you've got people. Billions of people walking around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. But then someone comes along with a vision. With a real... passion for destruction. Angel could pull it off. Goodbye, Picadilly. Farewell, Leicester Bloody Square. You know what I'm saying?
Buffy Okay, fine. You're not down with Angel. Why would you ever come to me?
Spike I want Dru back. I want it like it was before he came back. The way she acts around him...
Buffy You're pathetic.
Buffy I lost a friend tonight!
Spike I wasn't in on that raiding party.
Buffy And I may lose more! The whole earth may be sucked into Hell, and you want my help 'cause your girlfriend's a big ho? Well, let me take this opportunity to *not* care.
Spike I can't fight them both alone, and neither can you!
Buffy I hate you.
Spike And I'm all you've got.
Buffy All right. Talk.
Spike I'm just gonna kill this guy.
Spike Oh, right.
Buffy Let's get inside.
Cordelia Do you want some coffee?
Xander I don't wanna leave. She might, uh...
Cordelia I'll get it.
Xander Thanks.
Xander Come on, Will. Look, you don't have a choice here. You gotta wake up. I need you, Will. I mean, how am I gonna pass trig, you know? And who am I gonna call every night... and talk about everything we did all day? You're my best friend. You've always...
Xander I love you.
Xander Willow?
Willow Oz? Oz?
Oz I'm here.
Xander She's just starting to wake up.
Oz Hey, baby.
Willow Hi.
Xander I'm gonna go get a doctor.
Oz How you feelin'?
Willow My head... feels big. Is it big?
Oz No. It's head size.
Willow Uh... is everybody else okay?
Angelus Rupert, buddy... I'm here to tell you, I'm impressed.
Angelus Hey. Uh... How you holdin' up?
Giles Never... better.
Angelus Glad to hear it. Now... Tell me when it hurts.
Joyce Buffy?!
Joyce Where have you been? Are you okay? The police were here! I've been looking for you!
Buffy Mom, let's, let's go inside, and I can explain.
Joyce Who is this man? Who are you? Are you okay?
Buffy Mom! I'm-I'm okay.
Joyce Buffy, terrible things have happened. What were you doing?
Spike What, your mum doesn't know?
Joyce Know what?
Buffy That I'm, uh... in a band. A-a rock band with Spike here.
Spike Right. She plays the, the triangle.
Buffy Drums.
Spike Drums, yeah. She's, uh, hell on the old skins, you know.
Joyce Hmm. And, uh, what do you do?
Spike Well, I sing.
Buffy You know what? Why don't we go inside, and, and we can talk about this.
Joyce I'm, I'm not sure how I feel about this.
Spike One of Angel's boys.
Buffy Yeah, probably watching me. Or you.
Spike Yeah. He won't get a chance to tattle on us now.
Joyce Buffy... what... is going on?
Buffy Mom... I'm a Vampire Slayer.
Willow I'm okay, Buffy, really. I mean, I don't feel good, but... I'm awake, and I know my name and who's President and how many fingers, so they don't think my brain got mushed at all.
Buffy Thank God. So sorry I can't be there.
Willow I know. I'm sorry I didn't get to cure Angel.
Buffy Don't be. It just wasn't meant to be. I know I'm never gonna get him back the way he was. It just makes it easier.
Willow I guess. Any luck finding Giles?
Buffy Yep. I got a lucky break.
Willow What?
Buffy You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Buffy Xander. Angel and the others are holed up outside town. You remember that funky-looking mansion you showed me that time?
Xander On Crawford Street. Sure. That makes sense. What's the drill?
Buffy I'm gonna hit it come daybreak.
Xander You'll need backup.
Buffy No. You stay there. I'm covered.
Xander Do you, um... do you think Giles is still alive?
Buffy I think he is. I just wish he was here to tell me what to do.
Joyce Have we met?
Spike Um... you hit me with an ax one time. Remember? Uh, 'get the hell away from my daughter.'
Joyce Oh.
Joyce So, do you, uh, live here in town?
Joyce I-is Willow all right?
Buffy Yeah. She's fine. All right, talk. What's the deal?
Spike Simple. You let me and Dru skip town, I help you kill Angel.
Joyce Angel? Your boyfriend?
Buffy Forget about Drusilla. She doesn't walk.
Spike There's no deal without Dru.
Buffy She killed Kendra.
Spike Dru bagged a Slayer? She didn't tell me! Hey, good for her! Though not from your perspective, I suppose.
Buffy I can't believe I invited you into my house.
Joyce So you didn't kill that girl.
Buffy Of course not.
Joyce Did she explode like that man out there?
Buffy She was a Slayer, Mom.
Joyce Like what you are.
Spike Look. This deal works for me one way. Full stop. Me and Dru for Angel.
Joyce Honey, a-are you sure you're a Vampire Slayer?
Spike I'll take her out of the country. You'll never hear from us again, I *bloody* well hope.
Buffy Fine. Get back to the mansion. Make sure Giles is all right.
Joyce I-I mean, have you tried *not* being a Slayer?
Buffy Mom!
Buffy Be ready to back me up when I make my move.
Buffy If Giles dies... she dies.
Joyce It's because you didn't have a strong father figure, isn't it?
Buffy It's just fate, Mom. I'm the Slayer. Accept it.
Joyce We should call the police.
Buffy No. We're not calling the police.
Joyce Well, now that we know that you're innocent, it's...
Buffy What? You thought I was guilty? Jeez, feelin' the love in *this* room!
Joyce No, I didn't think that. It's just... now we have proof.
Buffy We have my word, Mom. Not proof.
Joyce Look, I am sure that they will understand.
Buffy Get them involved, you'll get them killed.
Joyce Well, you're not gonna hurt them, are you?
Buffy I'm a Slayer, not a postal worker.
Buffy Cops can't fight demons. I have to do it.
Joyce Do what? Buffy, what is happening?
Buffy Just have another drink.
Joyce Don't you talk to me that way! You don't get to just dump something like this on me and pretend it's nothing!
Buffy I'm sorry, Mom, but I don't have time for this.
Joyce No! I am tired of 'I don't have time' or-or 'you wouldn't understand.' I am your mother, and you will *make* time to explain yourself.
Buffy I told you. I'm a Vampire Slayer.
Joyce Well, I just don't accept that!
Buffy Open your eyes, Mom. What do you think has been going on for the past two years? The fights, the weird occurrences. How many times have you washed blood out of my clothing, and you still haven't figured it out?
Joyce Well, it stops now!
Buffy No, it doesn't stop! It *never* stops! Do-do you think I chose to be like this? Do you have any idea how lonely it is, how dangerous? I would *love* to be upstairs watching TV or gossiping about boys or... God, even studying! But I have to save the world... again.
Joyce No. This is insane. Buffy, you need help.
Buffy I'm *not* crazy! What I need is for you to chill. I *have* to go!
Joyce No. I am not letting you out of this house.
Buffy You can't stop me.
Joyce Oh yes I...
Joyce You walk out of this house, don't even *think* about coming back!
Cordelia So Buffy's going for the big showdown, huh? Wish we could help. You know, without dying.
Xander I don't see how.
Willow I wanna try again.
Oz Try what?
Willow The curse. We never got to finish it. Maybe we *can* restore Angel's soul.
Xander I don't like it. You're talking about messing with powerful magic, and you're weak.
Willow I'm okay.
Xander You don't look okay. Does she?
Cordelia You should listen to him. The hair, it's so flat, and the lips...
Xander Could we stay on topic here, honey?
Cordelia What?
Xander Look, it's not a good idea.
Willow There's no use arguing with me. Do you see my resolve face? You've seen it before. You know what it means. This can help Buffy. If we turn Angel back soon enough, we can stop him from ever awakening Acathla.
Oz Okay, I pretty much missed out on some stuff, didn't I? Because this is all making a kind of sense that's... not.
Willow Go with Cordy to the library and get my things. She'll fill you in.
Oz Sure. I'll drive.
Willow Xander, go to Buffy. Tell her what we're doing. Maybe she can stall.
Xander But I...
Willow Resolve face.
Xander Be careful.
Angelus You know, I can stop the pain. You've been very brave... but it's over. You've given enough. Now let me make it stop.
Giles Please!
Angelus Just tell me what I need to know.
Giles In order... to be worthy...
Angelus Yeah?
Giles You must perform the ritual... in a tutu.
Giles Pillock!
Angelus All right. Someone get the chainsaw.
Spike Now, now, don't let's lose our temper.
Angelus Keep out of it, sit 'n' spin.
Spike Look, you cut him up, you'll never get your answers.
Angelus Since when did *you* become so levelheaded?
Spike Right about the time you became so pig-headed. You have your way with him, you'll never get to destroy the world. And I don't fancy spending the next month trying to get librarian out of the carpet. There are other ways.
Angelus Enlighten me.
Spike Hmm. Drusilla? Sweetheart?
Spike Do you want to play a game?
Snyder You do know this is a crime scene, don't you? But then... you're a criminal, so that pretty much works out.
Buffy You know I didn't do it. The police will figure it out.
Snyder In case you haven't noticed, the police of Sunnydale are *deeply* stupid. It doesn't matter anyway. Whatever they find, you've proved too much of a liability for this school. These are the moments you want to savor. You wish time would stop so that you could live them over and over again. You're expelled.
Buffy You never ever got a single date in high school, did you?
Snyder Your point being?
Snyder It's Snyder. Tell the Mayor I have good news.
Drusilla Is that better? Hmm? Poor thing. Let's see what's inside.
Drusilla Of course.
Drusilla Look at me.
Drusilla Mm-mm-mm-mm.
Drusilla Be... in me.
Drusilla Hmm. See with your heart.
Giles Jenny! I thought I'd lost you.
Dru/Jenny Shh. I'll never leave you.
Giles We have to get out of here.
Dru/Jenny No-no-no-no-no. Slowly.
Giles It can't be you.
Dru/Jenny Did you tell Angel? About the ritual?
Giles No. We have to get... him away from Acathla.
Dru/Jenny Why? Is he close to figuring it out?
Giles Later.
Dru/Jenny Tell me what to do.
Dru/Jenny It's all right. We'll be together... finally. We'll have everything we never got to have... Never got to feel... Just tell me what to do.
Giles We have to get Angel away from Acathla.
Dru/Jenny Angel himself? He's the key?
Giles H-h-his, his blood... H-he mustn't...
Dru/Jenny Shh. Mm.
Angelus Blood. Of course. The blood on my hands must be my own. I am the key that will open up the door. My blood. My life. Okay. Kill him.
Spike Uh, but what if he's lying?
Angelus Yeah. Good point. Alright, don't kill him. You know, I kinda like having you watch my back. It's kinda like old times.
Spike Uh, Drusilla...
Angelus Honey...
Spike We are finished here, ducks.
Drusilla Sorry. I was in the moment.
Buffy Whistler. What did you mean, the sword isn't enough?
Whistler You know, raiding an Englishman's fridge is like dating a nun. You're never gonna get the good stuff.
Buffy Tell me how to use it.
Whistler Angel's the key. His blood will open the door to Hell. Acathla opens his big mouth, creates a vortex. Then only Angel's blood will close it. One blow will send 'em both back to Hell. But I strongly suggest that you get there before that happens, 'cause the faster you kill Angel, the easier it's gonna be on you.
Buffy Don't worry about me.
Whistler It's all on the line here, kid.
Buffy I can deal. I got nothing left to lose.
Whistler Wrong, kid. You got one more thing.
Buffy Xander!
Xander Cavalry's here. Cavalry's a frightened guy with a rock, but it's here.
Xander That's better.
Buffy You're not here to fight. You get Giles out, and you run like hell, understood? I can't protect you. I'm gonna be too busy killing.
Xander Now, that's a new look for you.
Buffy It's a present for Angel.
Xander Willow. Uh, she told me to tell you...
Buffy Tell me what?
Xander Kick his ass.
Angelus Acathla... Mundatus sum... pro te necavi. Sanguinem meum... pro te effundam... quo me dignum... esse demonstrem.
Translation Acathla... I am cleansed... here before you. My blood... flowing before you... makes me worthy... as I demonstrate.
Willow Are we ready?
Cordelia Stinky herbs are a go.
Oz Did I mention I didn't take Latin?
Willow Y-you don't have to understand it. You just have to say it. I hope.
Oz Right.
Angelus Now, Acathla...
Angelus You will be free.
Angelus And so will we all.
Buffy Hello, lover.
Angelus I don't have time for you.
Buffy You don't have a lot of time *left*.
Angelus Coming on kind of strong, don't you think? You're playing some deep odds here. Do you really think you can take us all on?
Buffy No. I don't.
Spike Painful, isn't it?
Spike I don't want to hurt you, baby.
Spike Doesn't mean I won't.
Oz Quod perditum est, invenietur.
Translation What is lost, return.
Willow Not dead... nor not of the living. Spirits of the interregnum, I call.
Xander Giles!
Xander Giles!
Giles Xander?
Xander Can you walk?
Giles You're not real.
Xander Sure, I'm real.
Giles It's a trick. They get inside my head, make me see things I want.
Xander Then why would they make you see me?
Giles You're right. Let's go.
Xander Come on.
Drusilla Oh... Here he comes.
Willow Gods, bind him. Cast his heart from the... evil... realm.
Angelus You almost made it, Buff.
Buffy It's not over yet.
Angelus My boy Acathla here is about to wake up. You're going to Hell.
Buffy Save me a seat.
Willow Return. I call on...
Oz Willow?
Cordelia Are you okay?
Willow Te implor, Doamne, nu ignora aceasta rugaminte.
Translation I implore you, Lord, do not ignore this request.
Oz Is this a good thing?
Willow Nici mort, nici al fiintei...
Translation Neither dead, nor of the living...
Cordelia Hey, speak English!
Willow Lasa orbita sa fie vasul care-i va transporta, sufletul la el.
Translation Let this Orb be the vessel that will carry his soul to him.
Spike Sorry, baby. Wish there was another way.
Spike God, he's gonna kill her.
Angelus Now that's everything, huh? No weapons... No friends... No hope.
Angelus Take all that away... and what's left?
Buffy Me.
Willow Asa sa fie! Asa sa fie! Acum!
Translation So it shall be! So it shall be! Now!
Willow Acum!
Translation Now!
Angel Buffy? What's going on?
Angel Where are we? I-I don't remember.
Buffy Angel?
Angel You're hurt.
Angel Oh, Buffy... God.
Angel I... I feel like I haven't seen you in months.
Angel Oh, my God, everything's so muddled. I...
Angel Oh...
Angel Oh, Buffy...
Angel What's happening?
Buffy Shh. Don't worry about it.
Buffy I love you.
Angel I love you.
Buffy Close your eyes.
Angel Buffy...
Joyce Buffy?
Giles Willow, are you sure you should be out of bed?
Willow Look who's talking.
Giles Yes.
Cordelia Any word?
Xander You guys haven't seen her either?
Willow No.
Oz But we know the world didn't end, 'cause... check it out.
Giles Well, we, uh... we went back to the mansion. I-it was empty, um... and Acathla was, was... dormant.
Willow I think the spell worked. I felt something go through me.
Cordelia Plus the Orb did that cool glow thing.
Xander Well, maybe it wasn't in time. Maybe she had to kill him before the cure could work.
Oz Well, then, she'd wanna be alone, I guess.
Willow Or maybe Angel *was* saved, and they want to be alone together.
Giles Perhaps.
Cordelia Well, she's gotta show up sooner or later. We still have school.
Willow Yeah. She'll be here in a while.

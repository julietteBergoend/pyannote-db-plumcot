buffy_summers NO! NO!
buffy_summers No...
joyce_summers Yes.
joyce_summers It's time to get up for school.
buffy_summers Mom?
joyce_summers Are you alright?
buffy_summers No. Uh, yeah! Yeah! I'm, I'm fine! Oh... School! Great.
joyce_summers You wanna go to school?
buffy_summers Sure! Why not?
joyce_summers Okay. Good day to buy that lottery ticket. I spoke with your father.
buffy_summers He's coming, right?
joyce_summers You're on for this weekend.
buffy_summers Good.
willow_rosenberg So, do you see your dad a lot?
buffy_summers Not a whole lot.
buffy_summers He's still in L.A. He, like, comes down for weekends sometimes.
willow_rosenberg When did they get divorced?
buffy_summers Well, it wasn't finalized till last year, but they were separated before that.
willow_rosenberg Musta been harsh.
buffy_summers Yeah, that's the word you're looking for. I-I mean, they were really good about it around me, anyway, but still...
willow_rosenberg My parents don't even bicker. Sometimes they glare. Do you know why your folks split up?
buffy_summers I didn't ask. They just stopped getting along. I'm sure I was a really big help, though, with all the slaying and everything. I was in so much trouble. I was a big mess.
willow_rosenberg Well, I'm sure that didn't have anything to do with him leaving.
buffy_summers No.
willow_rosenberg And he still comes down on weekends.
buffy_summers Sometimes.
cordelia_chase Hello? Doofus! You're in my light.
xander_harris Wendell, what is wrong with you? Don't you know that she is the center of the universe, and the rest of us merely revolve around her?
cordelia_chase Why don't you revolve yourselves out of my light?
xander_harris Uh, Wendell was in Cordelia's light.
wendell I'm so ashamed.
willow_rosenberg Why is she so Evita-like?
buffy_summers I think it's the hair.
willow_rosenberg It weighs heavy on the cerebral cortex.
xander_harris Hey, guys, was there any homework?
willow_rosenberg We're doing active listening today.
xander_harris Cool! What's active listening?
willow_rosenberg That would be the homework.
buffy_summers Chapter five? Active listening? Where you put on your big ears and really focus on the other person?
wendell Ms. Tishler demonstrated it yesterday.
willow_rosenberg With you!
buffy_summers She was wearing that tight sweater?
xander_harris Oh, the midnight blue angora! See, I was listening.
ms_tishler Alright, take your seats. In a moment we will choose partners and practice what we read about in chapter five.
ms_tishler Good, Xander, that's the spirit!
ms_tishler Before we do, let's review. Isaacson's research led him to conclude that one of our most fundamental needs after food and shelter is to be heard.
ms_tishler Wendell, would you read the first two paragraphs on page seventy-eight...
ms_tishler ...where Isaacson describes the rapid improvement active listening brought to some special needs clients.
wendell Please! Get 'em off of me! Help! Help! Get 'em off of me! Help me! Oh, please help me! Please!
billy_palmer Sorry about that.
wendell Please help me!
the_master Fear is a wonderful thing. It is *the* most powerful force in the human world. Not love, not hate... Fear! When you were a mortal boy, what did you fear?
collin Monsters.
the_master Ooo. We are *defined* by the things we fear. This symbol, these two planks of wood, it confounds me. Suffuses me with mortal dread. But fear is in the mind. Like pain. It can be controlled. If I can face my fear, it cannot master me. Something is happening above. Something new, powerful, psychic force. Do you feel it?
collin I feel change.
the_master Change. Yes. For the worse.
joyce_summers You're awfully quiet this morning.
buffy_summers I didn't sleep well.
joyce_summers I'll say. I came in to check on you twice. You were yelling in your sleep. Do you know what you were dreaming?
buffy_summers Not really. Oh, no, my bag! I-I packed it for the weekend and I forgot it!
joyce_summers You and your dad can swing by the house and get your bag. It's not an international crisis.
buffy_summers Okay. Yeah, I just, uh, had meant to bring it. H-he's picking me up here, right? A-at 3:30?
joyce_summers Honey, a-are you worried your father isn't gonna show?
buffy_summers No! N-not really. Should I be?
joyce_summers Well, of course, not! I-I-I just, I-I know it's a hard situation. You just have to remember that your father adores you. No more than I do, by the way.
buffy_summers Goodbye.
joyce_summers Have a great day.
buffy_summers Thanks.
willow_rosenberg Oh, Buffy, we've been looking for you.
xander_harris We have?
willow_rosenberg Oh, about the spiders, did you talk to Giles about...
xander_harris Oh, the spiders! Willow's been kind of, um, what's the word I'm looking for? Insane about what happened yesterday.
willow_rosenberg I don't like spiders, okay? Their furry bodies, and their sticky webs, and what do they need all those legs for anyway? I'll tell you: for crawling across your face in the middle of the night. Ewww! How do they not ruffle you?
xander_harris I'm sorry! I'm unruffled by spiders. Now, if a bunch of Nazis crawled all over my face...
buffy_summers Mm, it was pretty intense.
willow_rosenberg Thank you.
xander_harris Well, the Hellmouth, the center of mystical convergence, supernatural monsters: been there.
buffy_summers Little blase' there, aren't you?
xander_harris I'm not worried. If there's something bad out there we'll find, you'll slay, we'll party!
buffy_summers Thanks for having confidence in me.
xander_harris You da man, Buff!
willow_rosenberg Okay, but we're still caring about the spiders here. Let's not forget the spiders.
buffy_summers Well, Giles said he was gonna look it up. Giles?
willow_rosenberg Maybe he's in the faculty room.
buffy_summers Hey, Giles! Wakey, wakey!
rupert_giles I was, uh, in the stacks. I got lost.
xander_harris Did you find any theories on spiders coming out of books?
xander_harris Big, hairy, crawly...
xander_harris It's funny if you're me.
rupert_giles I couldn't find anything, uh... particularly illuminating. Um, I think perhaps you'd best have a chat with Wendell himself.
buffy_summers Okay. If he can still talk.
buffy_summers Hey, Wendell. How are you?
wendell Huh?
buffy_summers You okay?
xander_harris Good talking to ya, man.
wendell Do you guys want something?
buffy_summers We just thought you might wanna talk about what happened.
willow_rosenberg You know, yesterday? With the spiders?
wendell I don't know what to say about that.
xander_harris There's nothing *to* say. You saw two hundred insects, you Gonzoed, anybody would have.
wendell They're not insects. They're arachnids.
xander_harris They're from the Middle East?
wendell Spiders are arachnids. They have eight legs. Insects only have six. Why does everyone make that mistake?
buffy_summers Don't know. Has anything like this ever happened before?
buffy_summers When?
wendell Lots of times.
willow_rosenberg Ew! You must hate spiders more than I do.
wendell I don't hate spiders. I love 'em. They hate me.
cordelia_chase I hope you studied for the history test.
buffy_summers What history test?
cordelia_chase The one we're having in fourth period right now.
buffy_summers There's a history test? Nobody told me there was a history test! I haven't... I... Okay, I will catch up with you guys later.
willow_rosenberg What do you mean, you love spiders?
xander_harris It is platonic, right?
wendell I had the best collection in the tri-county area. Browns and tarantulas and black widows... Then my folks shipped me off to wilderness camp. All my brother had to do was maintain their habitats. Instead he left their heat lamp on for a week. When I came home they were all dead. That's when the nightmares started.
willow_rosenberg The nightmares?
wendell It's always the same. I'm sitting in the classroom, teacher asks me to read something, I open up my book and then there they are. They're comin' after me. God, can you blame them after what I did?
xander_harris And that's how it happens? Every time?
wendell Yesterday in class I thought I'd just nodded off again. But then everyone else started screaming, too.
cordelia_chase You don't know where class is, do you?
buffy_summers Uh...
cordelia_chase Hardly a shocker. You've cut history just about every time we've had it.
buffy_summers Well, I was there the first day. I think.
cordelia_chase It's in here.
buffy_summers I haven't been to class, I haven't read any of the assignments, how am I gonna pass this test?
cordelia_chase Blind luck?
buffy_summers Well, at least I know my name.
laura Well, they both got detention, which is completely unfair since Sean started it. Anyway, it means we can't do the movie.
laura I'm gonna take a break.
billy_palmer You shouldn't go in there.
Ugly_Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode10 Lucky nineteen!
buffy_summers I think they said room 3016.
rupert_giles Do you know the girl?
buffy_summers To say hi to. Laura's nice enough. Nobody saw who attacked her?
rupert_giles Well, I was rather hoping that Laura did.
buffy_summers Hey, Laura.
laura Hi.
rupert_giles I hope we're not intruding, um...
laura That's okay. I don't wanna be left alone.
rupert_giles You understand we're anxious to make sure this, this doesn't happen again.
buffy_summers Can you tell us what happened?
laura I was in the basement. I went down for a smoke. There was... someone there.
buffy_summers Someone you knew?
laura I've never... seen anything like it.
buffy_summers It?
rupert_giles Can you describe it?
buffy_summers Hey, that's okay. Don't worry about it.
rupert_giles Yes, you, you, you just rest now.
buffy_summers You know, but...
Nurse#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode10 Hi, Laura.
buffy_summers ...i-if you remember anything? You can tell us. Even if it may seem weird.
Nurse#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode10 She needs her rest now.
laura 'Lucky nineteen.'
rupert_giles I'm sorry?
laura It's what he said, right before... He said 'lucky nineteen'. That's weird, right?
rupert_giles Yes. Yes, it is.
buffy_summers Feel better.
rupert_giles Take care.
rupert_giles Doctor, is she gonna be alright?
doctor You family?
buffy_summers Friends.
doctor She'll recover. She's got a couple of shattered bones, a little internal bleeding... she got off pretty easy.
buffy_summers Easy?
rupert_giles Have you looked up the word lately?
doctor Well, the first one's still in a coma.
buffy_summers First what?
doctor First victim. They found him a week ago. Exact same M.O. as the girl, only he's in worse shape. If he doesn't wake up soon... Somebody's gotta stop this guy.
buffy_summers Somebody will.
way_cool_guy Listen, I'm not afraid of him.
way_cool_guy Hey, if he wants to fight, then I'm takin' him down. I'm not backin' off on this. This is about honor. I'll break his neck!
willow_rosenberg I'm just saying, Wendell had a dream and then that exact thing happened.
xander_harris Which is a fair wiggins, I admit, but do you think that ties in with Laura?
willow_rosenberg I dunno. Maybe she dreamed about getting beat up. We should ask Buffy when she gets back from the hospital.
cool_guys_mom Oh, there's my little baby!
way_cool_guy Mom, what are you doing here? Mom...
cool_guys_mom How's my little pookie?
way_cool_guy Mom, mom, please don't kiss me in front of the guys! It's embarrassing, mom! Please!
cool_guys_mom You cute little rascal, you!
way_cool_guy Mom... Thanks, but mom, please, my friends are right here...
xander_harris It could be a coincidence. Y'know, Wendell finds a spider's nest, and we all wig because he dreamt about spiders. So it may not be connected.
xander_harris If there is a connection it doesn't sound like anything... What?
willow_rosenberg Xander! What happened to your...?!
xander_harris I-I-I dunno! I was, uh, dressed a minute ago! It's a dream. It's gotta be a dream. Ow! Wake up. Ow! Gotta wake up.
rupert_giles This can't be happening. This can't be...
buffy_summers What's the word?
rupert_giles Oh, uh, I've got back issues of the, uh, papers, um, to try to do some research.
buffy_summers Did you find anything?
rupert_giles I don't know.
buffy_summers You don't know if you didn't find anything.
rupert_giles I'm having a problem.
buffy_summers What is it?
rupert_giles I-I can't read!
buffy_summers What do you mean? You can read, like, three languages.
rupert_giles Five, actually, on a normal day. Th-the words here don't make any s-sense. I-it's gibberish!
buffy_summers That's him.
rupert_giles Who?
buffy_summers The kid I've been seeing around school. 'Twelve-year-old Billy Palmer was found beaten and unconscious after his kiddie league game Saturday. Doctors describe his condition as critical.' When was this published? Last week. It says he's in a coma in intensive care. This is the boy from the hospital!
rupert_giles The first victim? Uh... You, you've seen him around the school?
buffy_summers Yeah, first when the spiders got Wendell, and, and then when I didn't know a thing on the history test. I thought it was weird seeing this kid around, but I forgot about it.
rupert_giles Uh, the boy's been in a coma for a week. How can this be possible?
buffy_summers What, am I knowledge girl now? Explanations are your terrain.
rupert_giles Uh, well, um, there's astral projection, uh, the theory that while one sleeps one has another body, a-an astral body, which can travel through time and space.
buffy_summers Billy's in a coma. That's like sleep, right?
rupert_giles In a manner of speaking, a-a-although one doesn't always awake from a coma.
buffy_summers Could I be seeing Billy's asteroid body?
rupert_giles Astral body, and I-I don't know. As usual, one doesn't have an inordinate amount of information to work with.
buffy_summers Lucky nineteen.
hank_summers There you are! I've been looking everywhere. Why aren't you in class?
buffy_summers Dad, what are you doing here? Y-you're not supposed to pick me up till after school. Is something wrong?
hank_summers Well, I, I need to talk to you.
buffy_summers Something *is* wrong. Is it mom?
hank_summers No, no, it's not your mother, she's fine. Could I speak with you for a moment? Privately?
buffy_summers Um, sure! Yeah. Uh, oh! I'm sorry. Dad, this is Mr. Giles, the librarian. Uh, this is my dad, Hank Summers.
rupert_giles My pleasure.
hank_summers Likewise.
buffy_summers I'll be back.
hank_summers I came early because there's something I've needed to tell you. About your mother and me. Why we split up.
buffy_summers Well, you always told me it was because...
hank_summers Uh, I know we always said it was because we'd just grown too far apart.
buffy_summers Yeah, isn't that true?
hank_summers Well, c'mon, honey, let's, let's sit down. You're old enough now to know the truth.
buffy_summers Is there someone else?
hank_summers No. No, it was nothing like that.
buffy_summers Then what was it?
hank_summers It was you.
buffy_summers Me?
hank_summers Having you. Raising you. Seeing you everyday. I mean, do you have any idea what that's like?
buffy_summers What?
hank_summers Gosh, you don't even see what's right in front of your face, do you? Well, big surprise there, all you ever think about is yourself. You get in trouble. You embarrass us with all the crazy stunts you pull, and do I have to go on?
buffy_summers No. Please don't.
hank_summers You're sullen and... rude and... you're not nearly as bright as I thought you were going to be... Hey, Buffy, let's be honest. Could you stand to live in the same house with a daughter like that?
buffy_summers Why are you saying all these things?
hank_summers Because they're true. I think that's the least we owe one another.
hank_summers You know, I don't think it's very mature, getting blubbery when I'm just trying to be honest. Speaking of which, I don't really get anything out of these weekends with you. So, what do you say we just don't do them anymore?
hank_summers I sure thought you'd turn out differently.
xander_harris Red alert! Where's Buffy?
rupert_giles Uh, she, she just stepped out. Her, her father came by early. He, he needed to talk to her. W... where are your other clothes?
xander_harris Oh, don't I wish I had the answer to *that* question.
willow_rosenberg Xander kinda found himself in front of our class not wearing much of anything.
xander_harris Except my underwear.
willow_rosenberg Yeah! It was really... ...bad. It was a bad thing.
xander_harris 'Bad thing'? I was naked. 'Bad thing' doesn't cover it.
willow_rosenberg Everyone staring? I would hate to have everyone paying attention to me like that.
xander_harris With nudity! It's a total nightmare.
willow_rosenberg Well, yeah Xander! I-it's your nightmare!
xander_harris Except the part with me waking up goin' 'it's all a dream'. It happened.
willow_rosenberg Like it happened to Wendell. That thing with the spiders? Wendell had a recurring dream about that.
rupert_giles I-I dreamt that I got lost in the stacks and I... I couldn't read... Of course!
xander_harris Uh, our dreams are coming true?
rupert_giles Dreams? That would be a musical comedy version of this. Nightmares, our, our nightmares are coming true.
willow_rosenberg So, why is this happening?
rupert_giles Billy.
xander_harris Well, that explanation was shorter than usual. It's Billy! Who's Billy?
rupert_giles He's a boy in the local hospital. He was beaten. He's in a coma. Somehow I think he's crossed over from the nightmare world he's trapped in.
xander_harris And he brought the nightmare world with him. Thanks a bunch, Billy.
willow_rosenberg How could he do that?
rupert_giles Things like that are easy when you live on a Hellmouth.
xander_harris Well, um, we have to stop it.
rupert_giles And soon. Or else everyone in Sunnydale is gonna be facing their own worst nightmares.
cordelia_chase I don't understand! This can't be happening! I was just at the salon!
cordelia_chase Oh, my God!
buffy_summers Billy?
buffy_summers Are you Billy Palmer?
billy_palmer I'm Billy.
buffy_summers Why are you here? Did something bad happen to you after your game?
billy_palmer Something bad? I, I don't remember.
buffy_summers Do you remember playing baseball?
billy_palmer Uh huh. Yeah. I play second base.
buffy_summers Are you 'lucky nineteen'?
billy_palmer That's what he calls me.
buffy_summers Who?
billy_palmer The Ugly Man. He wants to kill me. A-and he hurt that girl.
buffy_summers Why does he want to kill you, Billy?
billy_palmer He's...
buffy_summers Billy, it's okay! What? Just tell me.
billy_palmer He's here!
rupert_giles Buffy doesn't know this is happening. And given the sort of thing that she tends to dream about, it's imperative that we find her.
xander_harris Probably faster if we split up to look for her.
rupert_giles Good idea.
willow_rosenberg Oh, uh, faster, but... not really safer.
buffy_summers Billy!
billy_palmer I'm sorry, I can't help it.
buffy_summers Who is he?
billy_palmer He's the Ugly Man.
buffy_summers He's too strong! I can't fight him! We have to find my friends. They can help us.
billy_palmer We have to hide.
buffy_summers No! He'll find us!
billy_palmer Yes, but we have to hide. That's how it happens. We hide, and then he comes.
cordelia_chase No! What are you doing! Hey, no! You don't understand! I don't wanna go! I'm not even on the chess team! I swear, I'm not!
Voice#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode10 Willow!
cordelia_chase Nohoho!
Voice#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode10 Willow!
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
willow_rosenberg Hello? Buffy?
willow_rosenberg I'm not afraid. You'd think I'd be afraid, but I'm not.
xander_harris Alright! Someone else's loss is my chocolatey goodness.
xander_harris This is my lucky day!
buffy_summers Wha... I was sure this led to the library.
buffy_summers They're just playing. What is it? What's bothering you?
billy_palmer Baseball. When you lose, it's bad.
buffy_summers Did you lose your game last week?
billy_palmer It was my fault.
buffy_summers Why was it your fault?
billy_palmer I missed a ball and I should have caught it.
buffy_summers You missed one ball and the whole game was your fault? What, you were the only one playing? There wasn't eight other people on your team?
billy_palmer He said it was my fault.
buffy_summers Who said? Billy, did he hurt you after the game?
billy_palmer Can we go another way to find your friends?
buffy_summers Sure. Okay. We can go around the cafeteria.
buffy_summers Bad idea! Uh, this way! C'mon!
buffy_summers What just happened?
billy_palmer Is this where your friends are?
buffy_summers No, it's not.
Director#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode10 Man, I thought you weren't gonna show! Aldo is beside himself.
Emcee#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode10 Ladies and Gentlemen, we are proud to present two of the world's greatest singers!
Director#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode10 I hope you're warmed up. It's an ugly crowd out there tonight. All the reviewers showed up.
Emcee#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode10 All the way from Firenze, Italy, the one and only Aldo Gianfranco! And all the way from Sunnydale, California, the world's finest soprano, Willow Rosenberg!
willow_rosenberg But I... I didn't learn the words!
willow_rosenberg My turn?
aldo_gianfranco Mm-hmm!
xander_harris I love these bars!
xander_harris A Chocolate Hurricane! These are the best! I haven't had one of these since my...
xander_harris ...sixth... ...birthday.
buffy_summers I don't see the Ugly Man. I also don't know where the sun and the rest of the world went.
billy_palmer Look at this.
billy_palmer I guess we're gonna bury someone. I wonder who died.
the_master Nobody died.
the_master What's the fun of burying someone if they're already dead?
buffy_summers You!
the_master So! This is the Slayer! You're prettier than the last one.
buffy_summers This isn't real. Y-you can't be free!
the_master You still don't understand, do you? I am free because you fear it. Because you fear it, the world is crumbling. Your nightmares are made flesh. You have little Billy to thank for that.
buffy_summers This is a dream.
the_master A dream is a wish your heart makes. This is real life. Come on, Slayer! What are you afraid of?
buffy_summers No! Help me!
the_master How 'bout being buried alive?
buffy_summers Somebody help me! Please! No! No! Please! No! No! No! Somebody help me! Please! No!
buffy_summers Please! No! Help me! No!
buffy_summers Help!
xander_harris Did you find Buffy?
willow_rosenberg I had to sing! Very bad to sing!
xander_harris Willow, c'mon. Let's find the others.
willow_rosenberg What happened to you?
xander_harris Remember my sixth birthday party?
willow_rosenberg Oh, yeah! When the clown chased you and you got so scared that you had... Oh!
rupert_giles No sign of Buffy?
xander_harris You are a lousy clown! Your balloon animals are pathetic! Everyone can make a giraffe!
xander_harris I feel good! I feel liberated!
rupert_giles You seem to be the only one. Things are getting worse. In a few hours reality will fold completely into the realm of nightmares.
willow_rosenberg Well, what do we do?
rupert_giles The only thing I can think is to try and wake Billy.
xander_harris Uh, no, we can't leave without Buffy.
rupert_giles Agreed, but who knows where she might have gone?
willow_rosenberg Excuse me, when did they put a cemetery in across the street?
xander_harris And when did they make it night over there?
xander_harris Whose nightmare is this?
rupert_giles It's mine.
rupert_giles I've failed... in my duty to protect you. I should have been more c... cautious. Taken more time to train you. But you were so gifted. And the evil was so great. I'm sorry...
rupert_giles Buffy?
buffy_summers I thought I was dead!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, your face!
buffy_summers Oh, God!
xander_harris Buffy...
buffy_summers Don't look at me!
rupert_giles You never told me you dreamt of becoming a vampire.
buffy_summers This isn't a dream.
rupert_giles No. No, it's not. But there's a chance that we can make it go away. This all comes from Billy. Now, if, if we can only wake him up, I believe that the nightmares will stop and reality will shift back into place, but we must do it now! I need you to hold together long enough to help us. Can you do that?
buffy_summers Yeah. I think I can.
rupert_giles Thank you.
buffy_summers Well, we better hurry... 'cause I'm getting hungry.
xander_harris That is a... joke, right?
willow_rosenberg Are you sure everything will go back once he's awake?
rupert_giles Oh, uh, positive.
willow_rosenberg Well, how do we wake Billy up? What if we can't?
rupert_giles Willow, do shut up.
rupert_giles Doctor! Is the boy Billy still here?
doctor My hands!
xander_harris What now?
rupert_giles Um... Billy! Billy?
billy_palmer That won't work.
rupert_giles Billy! Uh, Billy, you have to wake up.
billy_palmer No. I told her. I have to hide.
rupert_giles Why? From what?
buffy_summers From him!
xander_harris Aw, man, what do we do?
buffy_summers I think I know.
willow_rosenberg Whatever it is, it better be soon!
buffy_summers Glad you showed up! You see, I'm having a really bad day.
Ugly_Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode10 Lucky nineteen!
buffy_summers Scary! I'll tell you something, though. There are a lot scarier things than you. And I'm one of them.
billy_palmer I-is he dead?
buffy_summers Come here, Billy.
billy_palmer I, I don't...
buffy_summers You have to do the rest.
willow_rosenberg What are they doing?
xander_harris I get it.
buffy_summers No more hiding.
xander_harris Hey, he's waking up!
billy_palmer I had the strangest dream. And you were in it, and you... Who are you people?
rupert_giles Let's get a doctor.
coach Oh! Huh. Billy's got company. I-I-I'm his kiddie league coach. I come by here every day, just hoping against hope that he's gonna wake up soon. He's, uh, my lucky nineteen.
coach So, um, how is he?
buffy_summers He's awake.
coach What?
buffy_summers You blamed him for losing the game. So you caught up with him afterwards, didn't you?
coach What are you talking about?
billy_palmer You said that it was my fault that we lost.
billy_palmer It wasn't my fault. There's eight other players on the team. You know that.
buffy_summers Nice going!
buffy_summers I just can't believe a kiddie league coach would do something like that.
xander_harris Well, you obviously haven't played kiddie league. I'm surprised it wasn't one of the parents.
willow_rosenberg I'm just glad he's behind bars where he belongs.
buffy_summers But that was kinda heroic, Xander, grabbing him and all.
xander_harris Well, I just did what anyone else would've. I mean, if you wanna label it heroic...
hank_summers Hi!
buffy_summers Have a killer weekend, guys!
hank_summers Hi, sweetheart! Oh, it's so good to see you! How was your day?
buffy_summers Fine. You know, usual.
willow_rosenberg Personal question?
xander_harris Yeah, shoot!
willow_rosenberg When Buffy was a vampire, you weren't still, like, attracted to her, were you?
xander_harris Willow, how can you... I mean, that's really bent! She was... grotesque!
willow_rosenberg Still dug her, huh?
xander_harris I'm sick, I need help.
willow_rosenberg Don't I know it.

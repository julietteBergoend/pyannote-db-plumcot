Angelus Passion.
Angelus It lies in all of us.
Angelus Sleeping...
Angelus ...waiting... And though unwanted...
Angelus ...unbidden... it will stir...
Angelus ...open its jaws, and howl.
Angelus It speaks to us... guides us... Passion rules us all. And we obey. What other choice do we have?
Buffy He was in my room.
Giles Who?
Buffy Angel. He was in my room last night.
Giles Are you sure?
Buffy Positive. When I woke up, I found a picture he'd left me on my pillow.
Xander A visit from the pointed-tooth fairy.
Cordelia Wait, I thought vampires couldn't come in unless you invited them in.
Giles Yes, but, uh, once you've invited them in, thereafter they're, they're always welcome.
Xander Y'know, I think there may be a valuable lesson for you gals here about inviting strange men into your bedrooms.
Cordelia Oh, God! I invited him in my car once. That means he can come into my car whenever he wants.
Xander Yep, you're doomed to havin' to give him and his vamp pals a lift whenever they feel like it. And those guys never chip in for gas.
Buffy Giles, there has to be some sort of spell to reverse the invitation, right? Like a barrier, a no shoes, no pulse, no service kind of thing?
Cordelia Yeah, that works for a car, too?
Giles Yes, well, I-I-I could check on my...
Xander Hello!
Xander Excuse me, but have you ever heard of knocking?
Jonathon We're supposed to get some books. On Stalin.
Xander Does this look like a Barnes & Noble?
Giles This is a school library, Xander.
Xander Since when?
Giles Uh, y-yes, yes, uh, third row. Historical biographies.
Jonathon Thanks.
Giles What... Oh!
Jonathon Hey, did you say that was the... Hello?
Giles So Angel has decided to step up his harassment of you?
Cordelia By sneaking in her room and leaving stuff at night? Why doesn't he just slit her throat or strangle her while she's sleeping or cut her heart out? What? I'm trying to help.
Giles Yes. Uh, uh, look, it's-it's classic battle strategy to throw one's opponent off his game. He-he-he's just trying to provoke you. Uh, to taunt you, to, to goad you into, uh, some mishap of some sort.
Xander The nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah approach to battle?
Giles Yes, Xander, once more you've managed to boil a complex thought down to its simplest possible form.
Buffy Giles, Angel once told me that when he was obsessed with Drusilla, the first thing h-he did was to kill her family.
Xander Your mom.
Buffy I know. I'm gonna have to tell her something. The truth?
Giles No. You-you-you-you can't do that.
Xander Yeah. The more people who know the secret, the more it cheapens it for the rest of us.
Buffy But I've gotta tell her something. I've gotta do something. Giles, Angel has an all-access pass to my house, and I'm not always there when my mother is. I can't protect her.
Giles I told you I will find a-a spell.
Buffy What about *until* you find a spell?
Cordelia Until then, you and your mother are welcome to ride around with me in my car.
Giles Buffy, I-I understand your concern, but it's imperative that you keep a level head through all this.
Buffy That's easy for you to say. You don't have Angel lurking in your bedroom at night.
Giles I know how hard this is for you. All right, I don't. But as the Slayer, you don't have the luxury of being a slave to your, your passions. You mustn't let Angel get to you. No matter how provocative his behavior may become.
Buffy So what you're basically saying is, 'just ignore him, and maybe he'll go away'?
Giles Yes. Precisely.
Xander Hey, how come Buffy doesn't get a snotty 'once again you boil it down to the simplest form' thing?
Xander Watcher's pet.
Jenny Don't forget, I need your sample spreadsheets by the end of the week.
Jenny Oh, and I want both a paper printout and a copy on disk. Thank you.
Jenny Willow.
Willow Yes?
Jenny Um, I might be a little late tomorrow. Do you think you could cover my class till I show?
Willow Really? Me? Teach the class? Sure!
Jenny Cool.
Willow Oh, wait. W-what if they don't recognize my authority? What if they try to convince me that you always let them leave class early? What if there's a fire drill? What if there's a fire?
Jenny Willow, you're gonna be fine. And I'll try not to be too late, okay?
Willow Okay. Good. Earlier is good. Will I have the power to assign detention? Or make 'em run laps?
Buffy Hey, Will.
Jenny Hi, Buffy. Rupert.
Buffy Willow, I thought I might take in a class. Figured I could use someone who knows where they are.
Willow Sorry. I have to talk to her. She's a teacher, and teachers are to be respected, even if they're only filling in until the real teacher shows up, because otherwise chaos could ensue...
Jenny How have you been?
Giles Uh, not so good, actually. Uh, since Angel lost his soul, he's regained his sense of whimsy.
Jenny Well, that sounds bad.
Giles He's been in Buffy's bedroom. I-I-I need to drum up a spell to, uh, keep him out of the house.
Jenny This might help. I've been doing a little reading since Angel changed. I don't think you have that one.
Giles Thank you.
Jenny So, how's Buffy doing?
Giles How do you think?
Jenny I know you feel betrayed.
Giles Yes. Well, that's one of the unpleasant side effects of betrayal.
Jenny Rupert... I was raised by the people that Angel hurt the most. My duty to them was the first thing I was ever taught. I didn't come here to hurt anyone, a-and I lied to you because I thought it was the right thing to do. I... I didn't know what would happen. I didn't know I was gonna fall in love with you.
Jenny Oh, God. Is it too late to take that back?
Giles Do you want to?
Jenny I just wanna be right with you. I don't expect more. I just want so badly to make all this up to you.
Giles I understand. But I'm not the one you need to make it up to.
Giles Thank you for the book.
Joyce Okay. What's wrong?
Buffy It's nothing.
Joyce Come on. You can tell me anything. I've read all the parenting books. You cannot surprise me.
Buffy Do you remember that guy Angel?
Joyce Angel, the, um... the college boy who was tutoring you in history?
Buffy Right. Uh, he... I-I... Oh, God. Um... We're sort of dating, *were* dating, um, going through a serious off-again phase right now.
Joyce Don't tell me. He's changed. He's not the same guy you fell for?
Buffy In a nutshell. A-anyway, um... since he changed, he's been kinda following me around. He's having trouble letting go.
Joyce Buffy, has he done anything...
Buffy No! No, it's not like that. He's just been hanging around... a lot. Just sending me notes, that kind of thing. I just don't wanna see him right now. I mean, if he shows up, I'll talk to him. Just... don't invite him in.
Willow I agree with Giles. You need to just try and not let him get to you. Angel's only doing this to try to get you to do something stupid. I swear, men can be such jerks sometimes. Dead or alive.
Buffy I just hope Giles can find a keep-out spell soon.
Buffy I know I'll sleep easier when I can... sleep easier.
Willow I'm sure he will. He's like book-man. Until then, try and keep happy thoughts and...
Buffy And what?
Buffy Willow?
Buffy Willow?
Willow Thanks for having me over, Buffy. Especially on a school night and all.
Buffy No problem. Hey, sorry about your fish.
Willow Oh, it's okay. We hadn't really had time to bond yet. Although for the first time I'm glad my parents didn't let me have a puppy.
Buffy It's so weird... Every time something like this happens, my first instinct is still to run to Angel. I can't believe it's the same person. He's completely different from the guy that I knew.
Willow Well, sort of, except...
Buffy Except what?
Willow You're still the only thing he thinks about.
Drusilla I brought something for you. Poor thing. She's an orphan. Her owner died... without a fight. Do you like her? Hmm? I brought her especially for you... to cheer you up. And I've named her... Sunshine! Open wide. Come on, love. You need to eat something to keep your strength up. Now, rrrrr, open up for mummy.
Spike I won't have you feeding me like a child, Dru.
Angelus Why not? She already bathes you, carries you around and changes you like a child.
Drusilla Why, Angel. Where have you been? The sun is almost up, and it can be so hurtful. We were worried.
Spike No, we weren't.
Drusilla You must forgive Spike. He's just a bit testy tonight. Doesn't get out much anymore.
Angelus Well, maybe next time I'll bring you with me, Spike. Might be handy to have you around if I ever need a really good parking space.
Spike Have you forgotten that you're a bloody guest in my bloody home?
Angelus And as a guest, if there's anything I can do for you... Any... responsibility I can assume while you're spinning your wheels... Anything I'm not already doing, that is.
Spike That's enough!
Drusilla Aww...
Drusilla You two boys... fightin' over me and all. Makes a girl feel...
Spike Dru, what is it, pet?
Drusilla The air. It worries. Someone... an old enemy is seeking help... help to destroy our happy home. Ohhhh...
Shopkeeper Welcome. How may I serve you today?
Jenny Uh...
Shopkeeper Love potion? Perhaps a voodoo doll for that unfaithful...
Jenny I need an Orb of Thesulah.
Shopkeeper Oh, you're in the trade. Sorry about the spiel, but around Valentine's Day, I get a lot of tourists shopping for love potions and mystical revenge of past lovers. Sad fact is, Ouija boards and rabbits' feet, that's what pay the rent around here. So how did you hear about us?
Jenny My Uncle Enyos told me about you.
Shopkeeper So you're Janna, then. Sorry to hear about your uncle.
Jenny Thank you.
Shopkeeper He was a good customer. Well, no, there you go. One Thesulan Orb. Spirit vault for the rituals of the undead. I don't get many calls for those lately. Sold a couple as new age paperweights last year. Yeah, I just love those new-agers, boy. They helped to send my youngest to college. By the way, you do know that the transliteration annals for the ritual of the undead were lost. Without the annals, the surviving text is gibberish.
Jenny And without a translated text, the Orbs of Thesulah are pretty much useless. Yeah, I know.
Shopkeeper Well, I only mention it because I have a strict policy of no refunds.
Jenny It's okay. I'm working on a computer program to translate the Rumanian liturgy to English based on a random sampling of the text.
Shopkeeper Yecchh. I don't like computers. They give me the willies.
Jenny Well, thank you.
Shopkeeper You're welcome.
Shopkeeper By the way... Not that it's any of my business, really, but, uh, what are you planning on conjuring up? If you can decipher the text?
Jenny A present for a friend of mine.
Shopkeeper Really? What are you gonna give him?
Jenny His soul.
Buffy We'll be in hiding, probably...
Buffy Siberia.
Xander Well, good morning, ladies. And what did you two do last night?
Willow We had kind of a 'pajama party sleepover with weapons' thing.
Xander Oh. And I don't suppose either of you had the presence of mind to locate a camera to capture the moment.
Willow I have to go. I have a class to teach in about five minutes, and I have to arrive early to glare disapprovingly at the stragglers. Oh, darn. She's here. Five hours of lesson planning yesterday down the drain...
Buffy You know what? I'll see you in class.
Buffy Hey.
Jenny Hi.
Jenny Uh, is there something that... Did you want something?
Buffy Look... I know you feel badly about what happened, and I just wanted to say...
Buffy Good. Keep it up.
Jenny Don't worry, I will.
Buffy Oh, wait. Um... He misses you. He doesn't say anything, I mean, but I know he does. And I don't want him to be lonely. I don't want anyone to.
Jenny Buffy, you know that if I have a chance to make this up...
Buffy We're... good here. Let's just leave it.
Giles I put it here somewhere. Oh, yes, yes. That's it. Could you, um, hang those up? Thank you. Buffy. So, uh, so how was your night?
Buffy Sleepless, but no human fatalities.
Giles I-I found a ritual to revoke the invitation to vampires.
Cordelia Oh, thank goodness. I actually had to talk my grandmother into switching cars with me last night.
Giles Um, the-the-the, uh, the ritual's fairly basic, actually. It's just the recitation of a few rhyming couplets, burning of, uh, moss herbs, sprinkling of holy water...
Buffy All stuff I have in my house.
Giles Hanging of crosses...
Willow I'm gonna have a hard time explaining this to my dad.
Buffy You really think it'll bother him?
Willow Ira Rosenberg's only daughter nailing crucifixes to her bedroom wall? I have to go over to Xander's house just to watch 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' every year.
Buffy I see your point.
Willow Although it is worthwhile to see him do the Snoopy Dance.
Cordelia Willow, are you aware that there are no fish in your aquarium?
Buffy You know, Cordelia, we've already done your car. Call it a night if you want.
Cordelia Right. Thanks. And you know I'd do the same for you if you had a social life.
Cordelia Oh. This must be for you.
Willow It's for you.
Buffy Mom.
Angelus Mrs. Summers, I need to talk to you.
Joyce You're Angel.
Angelus Did Buffy tell you about us?
Joyce She told me she wants you to leave her alone.
Angelus I-I can't. I can't do that.
Joyce You're scaring her.
Angelus You have to help me. Joyce... I need, I need to be with her. Y-you can convince her. You have to convince her.
Joyce Look, I'm telling you to leave her alone.
Angelus You have to talk to her for me, Joyce. Tell her I need her.
Joyce Please, look, I-I just wanna get inside, okay?
Angelus You don't understand, Joyce. I'll die without Buffy. She'll die without me.
Joyce Are you threatening her?
Angelus Please... Why is she doing this to me?
Joyce I'm calling the police now.
Angelus I haven't been able to sleep since the night we made love.
Angelus I need her. I know you understand.
Joyce Just leave us alone.
Willow 'Hicce verbis consensus rescissus est.'
Translation By these strong unanimous words is rescinded.
Buffy Sorry, Angel. Changed the locks.
Giles Hello.
Jenny Oh! Hi.
Giles You're working late.
Jenny Special project.
Giles Oh.
Jenny I spoke to Buffy today.
Giles Oh! Yes?
Jenny Mm. She said you missed me.
Giles Well, uh, she's... a meddlesome girl.
Jenny Rupert... Okay, I don't wanna say anything if I'm wrong, but I may have some news. Now, I need to finish up here. Could I see you later?
Giles Y-yes, yes. You could stop by my house.
Jenny Okay.
Giles Good.
Shopkeeper Sorry, honey. We're closed.
Shopkeeper W... What do you want?
Drusilla Miss Sunshine here tells me you had a visit today. But she worries. She wants to know what you and the mean teacher talked about.
Jenny Come on, come on...
Jenny That's it! It's gonna work! This... will work.
Jenny Angel... How did you get in here?
Angelus I was invited. The sign in front of the school... 'Formatia trans sicere educatorum.'
Jenny 'Enter all ye who seek knowledge.'
Angelus What can I say? I'm a knowledge seeker.
Jenny Angel, I-I-I've got good news.
Angelus I heard. You went shopping at the local boogedy-boogedy store. The Orb of Thesulah. If memory serves, this is supposed to summon a person's soul... from the ether... store it until it can be transferred.
Angelus You know what I hate most about these things?
Angelus They're so damn fragile. Must be that shoddy gypsy craftsmanship, huh?
Angelus I never cease to be amazed how much the world has changed in just two and a half centuries.
Angelus It's a miracle to me. You, you put the secrets to restoring my soul in here...
Angelus It comes out here. 'The Ritual of Restoration.' Wow. This, this brings back memories.
Jenny Wait. That's your...
Angelus Oh, my cure? No, thanks. Been there, done that, and deja vu just isn't what it used to be. My... Isn't this my lucky day. The computer... and the pages. Looks like I get to kill two birds with one stone.
Angelus And teacher makes three.
Jenny No!
Angelus Oh, good. I need to work up an appetite first.
Angelus Sorry, Jenny, this is where you get off.
Angelus Ah... I never get tired of doing that.
Giles Willow, good evening.
Willow Hi. Come on in. Here's the book.
Giles Right. I guess I should do my apartment tonight. The ritual go all right?
Willow Oh, yeah. It went fine. Well, it went fine until Angel showed up and told Buffy's mom that he and Buffy had... Well, you know, that they had... you know. You do know, right?
Giles Oh, yes. Yes. Sorry.
Willow Oh, good, 'cause I just realized that being a librarian and all, you maybe didn't know.
Giles Oh, thank you. I got it.
Willow You would have been proud of her, though. She totally kept her cool.
Willow Okay, well, I'll tell Buffy you stopped by.
Giles Would you, um... Perhaps I should intervene on, on Buffy's behalf w-w-with her mother. Um, maybe... say something?
Willow Sure! Like, what would you say?
Giles W... Uh...
Giles You will tell Buffy I dropped by?
Willow You bet.
Buffy That stuff with the Latins and the herbs, uh, he's just real superstitious.
Joyce Oh.
Buffy We just thought if...
Joyce Was he the first? No, wait. I don't wanna know. I don't think I want to.
Buffy Yeah. He was the first. I mean, the only.
Joyce He's older than you.
Buffy I know.
Joyce Too old, Buffy. And he's obviously not very stable. I really wish... I just thought you would show more judgment.
Buffy He wasn't like this before.
Joyce Are you in love with him?
Buffy I was.
Joyce Were you careful?
Buffy Mom, this is no time...
Joyce Don't 'Mom' me, Buffy. You don't get to get out of this. You had sex with a boy you *didn't* even see fit to tell me you were dating.
Buffy I made a mistake.
Joyce Yeah, well, don't just say that to shut me up, because I think you really did.
Buffy I know that! I-I can't tell you everything.
Joyce How about anything? Buffy, you can shut me out of your life, I am pretty much used to that. But don't expect me to ever stop caring about you, because it's never gonna happen. I love you more than anything in the world. That would be your cue to, uh, roll your eyes and tell me I'm grossing you out.
Buffy You're not.
Joyce Oh, well... I guess that was the talk.
Buffy So how'd it go?
Joyce I don't know. It was my first.
Giles Hello?
Giles Jenny?
Giles It's me!
Officer Mr. Giles, I need to ask you to come with us. Just to answer a few questions.
Giles Of course. Yes. Procedure. I need to make a phone call... if that's all right.
Giles Yes.
Angelus Passion is the source of our finest moments. The joy of love... the clarity of hatred... and the ecstasy of grief.
Buffy Hello. Giles, hey! We did the, the thing. It worked. What?
Willow Giles?
Willow What? No! No! Noooo!
Buffy Where's Giles?
Xander No luck. By the time we got to the station, the cops said he'd already left. I guess they just wanted to ask him some questions.
Buffy Cordelia, will you drive us to Giles' house?
Cordelia Of course.
Willow But don't you think he wants to be left alone?
Buffy I'm not worrying about what he wants. I'm worried about what he's gonna do.
Xander Hello? Giles?
Xander I guess Giles had a big night planned tonight.
Buffy Giles didn't set this up. Angel did. This is the wrapping for the gift.
Xander Oh, man. Poor Giles.
Willow Look, all his weapons are gone.
Cordelia But I thought he kept his weapons at the library.
Xander No, those are his, uh, everyday weapons. These were his good weapons. The ones he, uh, breaks out when company comes to visit.
Willow So he's not here.
Cordelia Well, then where is he?
Buffy He'll go to wherever Angel is.
Willow That means the factory, right?
Cordelia So Giles is gonna try to kill Angel then?
Xander Well, it's about time somebody did.
Willow Xander!
Xander I'm sorry, but let's not forget that I hated Angel long before you guys jumped on the bandwagon. So I think I deserve a little something for not saying 'I told you so' long before now. And if Giles wants to go after the, uh, fiend that murdered his girlfriend, I say, 'Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!'
Buffy You're right.
Xander Thank you.
Buffy There's only one thing wrong with Giles' little revenge scenario.
Xander And what's that?
Buffy It's gonna get him killed.
Spike Are you insane?! We're supposed to kill the bitch, not leave gag gifts in the friends' beds.
Drusilla But, Spike, the bad teacher was going to restore Angel's soul.
Spike What if she did? If you ask me, I find myself preferring the old Buffy-whipped Angelus. This new, improved one is not playing with a full sack. I love a good slaughter as much as the next bloke, but his little pranks will only leave us with one incredibly brassed-off Slayer!
Angelus Don't worry, roller boy. I've got everything under control.
Angelus Jeez, whatever happened to wooden stakes?
Spike Uh-uh. No fair going into the ring unless he tags you first.
Angelus All right. You've had your fun. But you know what it's time for now?
Buffy My fun.
Angelus Are you gonna let your old man just burn?
Giles Why did you come here?! This wasn't your fight!
Buffy Are you trying to get yourself killed?!
Buffy You can't leave me. I can't do this alone.
Angelus It hurts sometimes more than we can bear.
Angelus If we could live without passion, maybe we'd know some kind of peace. But we would be hollow.
Angelus Empty rooms, shuttered and dank...
Angelus Without passion, we'd be truly dead.
Giles In my years as... Watcher... I've buried... too many people. But Jenny was the first I've loved.
Buffy I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't kill him for you... for her... when I had the chance.
Buffy I wasn't ready.
Buffy But I think I finally am.
Willow Hi. Principal Snyder asked me to fill in for Ms. Calendar... u-until the new computer science teacher arrives. So I'm just gonna stick to the lesson plan she left.
Buffy I can't hold on to the past anymore. Angel has gone. Nothing's ever gonna bring him back.

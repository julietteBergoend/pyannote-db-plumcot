dr_angelman The project, it escaped.
rupert_giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
buffy_summers The Initiative created this thing and they can't stop it. But we will.
buffy_summers It's Faith, she's awake.
joyce_summers You all right.
faith Five by five.
Mayor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Open the box.
Mayor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Surprise.
buffy_summers Five by five.
officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 It's good you called. We've been looking for this girl since she broke out of the hospital.
joyce_summers What's gonna happen to her?
officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Well, get her checked out. She's in stable condition, she goes to jail, pending trial.
joyce_summers I just hope she gets some kind of help.
officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 The first thing is to keep her from hurting anybody else.
faith No. Personnel lifting her into
ambulance#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 One two
officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Well, you guys will be safe now. We may have a couple of questions in the morning.
joyce_summers Oh, uh, of course.
officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Thank you. Both. I'm glad we finally got the kid.
buffy_summers She's not a kid! I just mean that she's very strong.
officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Yeah.
buffy_summers She truly is.
joyce_summers Faith.
joyce_summers Why do you think she's like that?
buffy_summers You know. She's a nut job. Heh.
joyce_summers I just don't understand what could drive a person to that kind of behavior.
buffy_summers Well, how do you know she got drove? I mean, maybe she likes being that way.
joyce_summers I'll never believe that. I think she's horribly unhappy.
buffy_summers Well, could be things are looking up. I mean, a little stint in the pokey, show her the error of her ways. I'm sure there's some big old Bertha just waiting to shower her ripe little self with affection.
joyce_summers Buffy!
buffy_summers I'm sorry, mom. It's just ufff when I think about how she might have hurt you, I just, uff I can't stand it.
joyce_summers Sorry.
buffy_summers No, I'm just, uff, sore from the fight.
joyce_summers I've missed you.
buffy_summers Cause I haven't visited, right? I knew it.
joyce_summers I know how it is. You have so much in your life now.
buffy_summers I'm a busy little beaver.
joyce_summers Of course. But um, maybe we could spend some time together soon? Some... night when I'm not being held hostage by a raving psychotic.
buffy_summers Count on it. I'm gonna take a bath.
buffy_summers Why, yes, I would be Buffy. May I help you?
buffy_summers Buffy.
buffy_summers You can't do that. it's wrong.
buffy_summers You can't do that because it's naughty.
buffy_summers Because it's wrong.
buffy_summers You can't do that. It's wrong. I'll kick your ass. I'm gonna kill you.
faith Let me go! Let me go!
Doctor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Get me a sedative now!
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Hold her!
faith I have to go home! She's with my mother.
faith No!
Doctor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Just lie still.
faith You don't understand.
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Keep holding her.
faith She's taken my...my body.
willow_rosenberg I wonder where she is.
tara_maclay Who? Faith?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. I wish she would make a move. she's making my stomach all acidy.
tara_maclay But you think Buffy can handle her.
willow_rosenberg I think so. but that doesn't mean Faith won't hurt someone else.
tara_maclay Well, you should be safe. nobody knows you're here. I mean, uf, they don't even know I exist, right? I know all about them, but…
willow_rosenberg Hey.
tara_maclay I-I mean, t-that's totally cool. It-it's good. It-it's better.
willow_rosenberg Tara, it's not like I don't want my friends to know you. It's just... well, Buffy's like my best friend, and she's really special. And there's this whole bunch of us, and we sort of have this group thing that revolves around the slaying, and-and I, I really want you to meet them. But I kind of like having something that's just, you know, mine. And I, I usually don't se so many words to say stuff that little, but do you get that at all?
tara_maclay I do.
willow_rosenberg I should check in with Giles, get a situation update.
tara_maclay I am, you know.
willow_rosenberg What?
tara_maclay Yours.
buffy_summers Not too bad.
buffy_summers Score.
buffy_summers 6-4-4-7. Uh, expiration, 5-0-1. Unh huh. Yeah. 10 a.m.'s your earliest flight? I'll take it.
joyce_summers What are you doing?
buffy_summers Oh, just getting my mail.
joyce_summers Oh. Um, that was, um, Giles on the other line. He wanted you to meet your friends there. Said he had news.
buffy_summers Yeah. I got some time to kill. I'll go see the gang. All my friends. You don't mind if I steal this, right?
joyce_summers Is that the Harlot?
buffy_summers Yeah.
joyce_summers That's the same one Faith picked.
buffy_summers Burn it.
Policeman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 She's coming to. Uniformed
Policeman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Yeah.
Policeman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Man, I want this kid's constitution.
faith Faith.
Policeman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Let's move it. I want to get her in before she's 100%.
weatherby By order of the Watcher's Council, you are being taken into custody until such time--
collins Skip the speech.
collins Let's go.
rupert_giles Buffy. good.
buffy_summers The scooby gang's all here. Willow, Xander, and... everybody. What's up?
rupert_giles It's about Faith, not surprisingly.
buffy_summers Didn't Joyce tell you? I already kicked that ass.
xander_harris I feel a high five coming on.
willow_rosenberg Where is she?
buffy_summers On her way to the big house. Cops took her off my hands about an hour ago. Poetic justice.
anya How's that?
buffy_summers Well, she did all those crimes, and now she's being arrested. I guess that's just regular justice. It's cool, anyway.
rupert_giles Unless I'm mistaken, Faith is no longer in police custody.
buffy_summers What are you talking about?
rupert_giles Watcher's Council. They uh sent a retrieval team to capture Faith.
buffy_summers Well, yeah, I mean, 'cause it worked so well when Wesley tried it.
rupert_giles This is a special operations unit. They, uh, handle the council's trickier jobs - smuggling, interrogation, wetworks.
willow_rosenberg What's wetworks?
xander_harris Scuba-type stuff.
anya I thought it was murder.
xander_harris Well, yeah, but there could be underwater murder, with snorkels.
buffy_summers So they're taking her to England?
rupert_giles It'll be a long, long time before she returns.
buffy_summers Heh heh heh. ahhh Hah hah. Hah hah. ohhh I'm sorry. It's just...I'm happy. Faith is evil.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. I hope they throw the book at her.
rupert_giles I'm not sure there is a, a book for this.
willow_rosenberg They could throw other things.
buffy_summers I forgot how much you don't like Faith.
willow_rosenberg After what she's done to you? Oh, I wish those council guys would let me have an hour alone in the room with her, if I was larger and had grenades.
buffy_summers I bet I know what Faith would say to that.
anya So what you're saying is that everything's fine?
rupert_giles Oh, um, yes.
anya Well, I'm glad you called us all here because that information could never be conveyed by telephone. Willow What's up?
rupert_giles Well, I just thought it was, uh, best to convene, in case there were any loose ends
buffy_summers I'd never let her hurt you.
rupert_giles or things that we might have forgotten.
willow_rosenberg I know.
rupert_giles But if you're, uh, keen to go, then, please, by all means, go.
xander_harris We kind of have a romantic evening planned.
anya We were gonna light a bunch of candles and have sex near them.
buffy_summers Well, we certainly don't want to cut into that seven minutes.
anya Hey.
xander_harris I believe that's my hey. Hey!
buffy_summers Lighten up. We're out of danger. Everything's good.
rupert_giles We still have Adam to take care of.
buffy_summers Yeah. Adam. What's up with him?
rupert_giles I wish we knew.
buffy_summers Well, don't worry about it. I'll patrol tonight, as long as it takes. You guys have your fun, I'll be out there doing my job.
buffy_summers Whoop.
spike Oh, you.
buffy_summers And you.
spike What, are you keeping tabs on me? You're gonna give me a hard time now?
buffy_summers Um, do I usually give you a hard time?
spike Very funny. Well, you don't have to worry about me drinking. Unless you're here to protect innocent beers.
buffy_summers You're a vampire.
spike Was. And as soon as I get this chip out of my head, I'll be a vampire again. But until then, I'm just as helpless as a kitten up a tree. So why don't you sod off?
buffy_summers Ok.
spike Oh, fine! Throw it in my face! Spike's not a threat anymore. I'll turn my back. He can't hurt me.
buffy_summers Spike? Spike. William the Bloody with a chip in his head. I kind of love this town.
spike You know why I really hate you, Summers?
buffy_summers 'Cause I'm a stuck-up tight-ass with no sense of fun?
spike Well, yeah, that covers a lot of it.
buffy_summers Cause I could do anything I want, and instead, I choose to pout and whine and feel the burden of slayerness? I mean, I could be rich, I could be famous, I could have anything. Anyone. Even you, Spike. I could ride you at a gallop until your legs buckled and your eyes rolled up. I've got muscles you've never even dreamed of. I could squeeze you until you popped like warm champagne, and you'd beg me to hurt you just a little bit more. And you know why I don't? Because it's wrong. Humh humh.
spike I get this chip out, you and me are gonna have a confrontation.
buffy_summers Count on it.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 It was too crowded. We gotta hold out for a few hours, pick up a straggler, some drunk. Can't be calling attention to ourselves.
adam I've been thinking. About vampires.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 This is my place.
adam You're place. Yes. The sewers. You hide from them, Crawl about in their filth. Scavenging like rats. What do you fear?
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Kill this guy already.
adam You fear the cross. The sun. Fire. And, oh, yes...
adam I believe decapitation is a problem as well.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 You can have the place. I mean, we don't have to stay here anymore.
adam You fear death. Being immortal, you fear it more than those to whom it comes naturally. Vampires are a paradox.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Ok, we're a paradox. That's cool.
adam Demon in a human body. You walk in both worlds and belong to neither. I can relate. Come. We have a lot to talk about.
weatherby Well, it's awake.
faith Who are you?
weatherby Council. We're taking you back to the mother country. Seems you've been a naughty girl.
faith Listen to me. Y-You've made a mistake. I am not Faith. I'm Buffy Summers.
collins Congratulations. No one's ever actually tried that one on me before.
faith You have to find Faith. C-call Giles. J-just get him here.
collins Giles doesn't work for the council anymore. For that matter, neither does Buffy Summers. And what you are, miss, is a package. I deliver the package. I don't much care what's inside. Come on.
weatherby He may not care, but I do. The Watcher's Council used to mean something. You perverted it. You trash. We should have killed you while you were asleep.
willow_rosenberg I can't believe you've never been here. The Bronze is the coolest place in Sunnydale. Of-of course, there's not a lot of competition. I think the vending machine at Bergen's came in second.
tara_maclay Y-you used to come here a lot?
Others#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Chug chug chug
willow_rosenberg I lived here. Me, Xander…
buffy_summers & others Chug, chug, chug.
willow_rosenberg Buffy.
buffy_summers & others Chug, chug, chug.
buffy_summers oooh ooooh
Others#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Chug, chug, chug!
Others#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Woo hoo hoo.
willow_rosenberg Wow. I-I didn't think she'd be here. Come on, I want you to meet her.
buffy_summers Back off. You're nothing but a disappointment.
willow_rosenberg Hey, Buffy.
buffy_summers Willow and - uh
willow_rosenberg Buffy, this is Tara.
tara_maclay Hi.
buffy_summers So we've never met. Cool. Just have a thing with names.
willow_rosenberg Tara was in my wicca group.
buffy_summers Unh-huh.
willow_rosenberg So, what's up? Patrol a no go?
buffy_summers Got tired. You know, the whole Faith thing. I let off some steam.
willow_rosenberg Good for you. You shouldn't work yourself too hard.
buffy_summers That's my philosophy.
willow_rosenberg Anyone want a soda?
tara_maclay Water.
buffy_summers So you guys been hanging out a lot lately, hunh?
tara_maclay Yeah. she's, um, she's really cool.
buffy_summers So Willow's not driving stick anymore. Who would have thought? I guess you never really know someone until you've been inside their sking. And Oz is out of the picture? Oh, never seen two people so much in love. She just couldn't get enough of old Oz.
tara_maclay She, um, said he, uh, uh, w-w-w-w-w-went
buffy_summers He w-w-w-w-what? You gonna get that sentence out sometime tonight?
willow_rosenberg Buffy, guy in the corner.
buffy_summers Yeah. Good call.
tara_maclay What?
willow_rosenberg Vampire.
buffy_summers Wicked obvious. So I should slay him.
willow_rosenberg You want help?
buffy_summers Nah, I got it.
buffy_summers Hey!
buffy_summers You'll live.
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Uh he was so strong, uh
buffy_summers Yeah, well, he's gone now.
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Thank you. Thank you.
buffy_summers Yeah. It's cool.
willow_rosenberg Everything poofed?
buffy_summers All's well in the world.
willow_rosenberg Tara's not feeling well. I'm gonna walk her home.
buffy_summers Yeah. You give her whatever she needs.
willow_rosenberg Are you gonna be in later, or you going over to Riley's?
smith This'll bloody keep you quiet.
smith Uh.
faith How about this? I'll be quiet, and you can scream.
smith Aaahh.
faith Now you unchain me - very slowly And! politely, or I kill this guy
collins When we go on a job, we always put our affairs in order first, in case of accident.
smith Collins...
collins Sorry, Smithy.
collins She's starting to bother me.
weatherby Getting her across the border is gonna be a lot more trouble than it's worth.
collins If the council can even get us passage. I'll call them. It's time for a contingency plan.
buffy_summers Hi, baby.
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry you're feeling all blechy. But we'll get together with Buffy another time. Sometime soon. I think you'll really like her.
tara_maclay She's not your friend.
willow_rosenberg I may have overestimated the you liking her factor.
tara_maclay No, no. I mean, I don't... I don't think she's...her.
willow_rosenberg You lost me.
tara_maclay Well, umph, a person's energy has a flow, a unity. Buffy's was was fragmented. It-it grated, like something forced in where it doesn't belong. Plus, she was, um, she was kind of mean.
willow_rosenberg So you think Buffy's not herself? Like she's been possessed or something?
tara_maclay I'm not sure.
willow_rosenberg You didn't sense a hyena energy at all, did you? Because hyena possession is just...unpleasant.
tara_maclay Do you have anything of hers?
willow_rosenberg Of Buffy's? Uhhhh. Oh! This ring.
tara_maclay I-I think there's a way we can, hmm... The passage to the nether realm. There-there's a ritual. If you can find Buffy there, you should be able to see.
willow_rosenberg If it'll help her.
willow_rosenberg What?
tara_maclay Well, the nether realm exists beyond the physical world. Accessing it is... I-it-it's kind of like astral projection. It's very intense. I'd have to be your anchor, keep you on this plane.
willow_rosenberg I trust you.
tara_maclay It-it's not like anything that we've ever
willow_rosenberg I trust you.
buffy_summers You miss me?
riley_finn I did, actually. Everything's ok?
buffy_summers Everything's great.
riley_finn What about Faith?
buffy_summers Faith has a won a fabulous trip to England, and I got the consolation prize, which is you.
riley_finn So I don't have to worry about Faith showing up? Though I have to admit, I was kind of curious to meet her.
riley_finn Or I was until about 30 seconds ago.
buffy_summers Oh, you wouldn't have liked Faith. She's not proper and joyless, like a girl should be. She has a tendency to give in to her animal instincts.
riley_finn Door's open.
buffy_summers So?
riley_finn So my fantasies don't tend to include a bunch of marines staring in at me.
buffy_summers Oh, maybe they could learn something.
buffy_summers You're hurt.
riley_finn Ahh, um, not that bad, actually. I guess the, uh, drugs the professor gave me really did make me stronger. I'm healing pretty quick.
buffy_summers Maybe we should take you for a test drive.
riley_finn I wouldn't say no.
buffy_summers So...how do you want me?
riley_finn How do I?
buffy_summers Yeah. what do you wanna do with this body? What nasty little desire have you been itching to try out? Am I a bad girl? Do you wanna hurt me?
riley_finn What are we playing at here?
buffy_summers I'm Buffy.
riley_finn Ok. then I'll be Riley.
buffy_summers Well, if you don't wanna play--
riley_finn Right. I don't wanna play.
riley_finn I love you.
buffy_summers Uggnnh Get off. No. No. No! Get-get off! No. Off me. Get off. No, no-o. G-get
riley_finn Buffy...What? What's wrong?
buffy_summers Who are you? What do you want from h-her?
riley_finn Should I not have...?
buffy_summers This is meaningless.
riley_finn You're shaking.
buffy_summers Nnnh.
riley_finn What happened?
buffy_summers Nothing. Nothing.
adam I have a gift no man has. No demon has ever had. I know why I'm here. I was created to kill. To extinguish life wherever I find it. And I have accepted that responsibility. You have lived in fear and desperation because you didn't have that gift. But it's time to face your fear.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Tell us what to do.
adam You are here to be my first. To let them know that I am coming.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 We're ready.
adam Then ask yourself, what is it? More than man, more than anything else. What is the thing you fear?.
forrest_gates Hope you left him alive.
buffy_summers What?
forrest_gates Boy's supposed to be on the mend. I don't see you letting him get much rest.
buffy_summers I think maybe you should stay out of other people's lives.
forrest_gates We've got a mission here. Back when Riley could still think for himself...
buffy_summers You've got a mission? I've been fighting demons since before you could shave.
forrest_gates Yeah, you're a killer.
buffy_summers I am not a killer!!! I am the slayer!. And you don't know the first thing about me.
forrest_gates You really care what I think?
buffy_summers No. I don't care. God, I don't care.
collins They can't get us passage. They've ordered the kill.
weatherby Torch the place?
collins Get the gas.
smith She could've killed me. She didn't.
collins Lucky you.
smith Weatherby!
faith Keys, keys.
weatherby Stop her, you ponce.
faith Ok, I'm good at this.
faith Ooh, drive.
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Here, there you go.
buffy_summers Thank you.
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 You're welcome.
faith Giles!
rupert_giles God!
faith Don't move. Ok, Giles, you have to listen to me very carefully. I'm not Faith.
rupert_giles Really?
faith Really.
rupert_giles Cause the resemblance is striking.
faith I know. Giles, you just have to... Stop inching. you were inching.
rupert_giles Look, I-I know what you're going to say, and-and uh
faith I'm Buffy.
rupert_giles All right, I didn't know what you were going to say, but that doesn't make you any less crazy.
faith Faith switched. I mean, she had some device. She switched our bodies. Giles, I swear it's me.
rupert_giles U-um, if-if you are Buffy, then, uh, then you'll let me tie you up w-without killing me - until we find out whether you're telling the truth.
faith Giles, Faith has taken my body, and for all I know, she's taken it to Mexico by now. I-I don't have time for bondage fun. Ask me a question. Ask me anything.
rupert_giles Who's president?
faith We're checking for Buffy, not a concussion.
rupert_giles Oh, yes, Alright. um...
faith Umph, Giles, you turned into a demon, and I knew it was you. I mean can't you just look in my eyes and be all intuitive?
rupert_giles How did I turn into a demon?
faith Oh, cause, uh, Ethan Rayne. And-and you have a girlfriend named Olivia, and you haven't had a job since we blew up the school, which is valid lifestyle wise. I mean, it's not like you're a slacker type, but... Oh, oh! when I had psychic power, I heard my mom think that you were like a stevedore during sex. What? Do you want me to continue?
rupert_giles Actually, I beg you to stop.
faith What's a stevedore?
rupert_giles Alright, let's-- um, I need you to explain everything.
faith And I will, after we get Faith.
willow_rosenberg Giles!
faith Will.
willow_rosenberg Oh, my god.
faith Willow, wait. you don't understand.
willow_rosenberg You're Buffy. You and Faith switched bodies, probably through a Draconian Katra spell.
rupert_giles She understands it better than I do.
faith How did you?
willow_rosenberg Tara. Tara, this is Buffy, only really this time.
tara_maclay Hi.
willow_rosenberg Tara's a really powerful witch.
tara_maclay Not really.
willow_rosenberg No, really. She knew right away that you weren't you. So we connected with the nether realms to find out what happened. And we conjured this.
faith What is--
willow_rosenberg It's a Katra. Or the home-conjured version. It-it should switch you back, if you can get a hold of Faith.
faith Oh, thank God.
rupert_giles I'll get it.
rupert_giles Hello.
faith Do you know where Faith is?
rupert_giles Oh yes, uh, Buffy's here with uh, me. Actually, she--she's uh Oh, all right.
rupert_giles Xander. Apparently there's a report on the television.
News#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 announcer ...and barricaded themselves in the church with at least 20 parishioners. One of the few who escaped described the three men as frighteningly disfigured, almost inhuman. So far, one escapee has since died of severe neck wounds.
News#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 announcer There is no report on the condition of the parishioners still trapped inside, but their assailants have vowed to kill all of them if police attempt to storm the church. Interior of church.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 It's hard to believe. I've been avoiding this place for so many years, and it's nothing. It's nice! It's got the pretty windows, The pillars... lots of folks to eat. Where's the thing I was so afraid of? You know, the Lord? He was supposed to be here. He gave us this address. Well, we'll just have to start killing off His people, see if He shows up.
riley_finn What'd he say?
Policeman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 He said I should defer command to you.
riley_finn Then you hold your men until the reserves arrive. This is a military situation.
Policeman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 What, they got bombs in there?
riley_finn Your men are not prepared to deal with them. Just trust me.
riley_finn Buffy.
buffy_summers How many are in there?
riley_finn We think there's three.
buffy_summers I can do three.
riley_finn Not alone. Look wait for the troops to get here. They're still mobilizing.
buffy_summers How did you respond so fast?
riley_finn I didn't. I was just late for church.
buffy_summers Look, when the troops get here, send 'em in, but I'm going.
riley_finn I don't want you risking--
buffy_summers Don't tell me what to do! I'm Buffy. I have to do this.
riley_finn Then I'm coming with.
riley_finn Ow!
buffy_summers I can't use you. someone comes out, you get 'em to safety. Unless they've got fangs.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 I told the cops, they send any one in, I start the whole massacre thing.
buffy_summers Well, I'm not the cops. I just come to pray.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 now's a good time to start.
buffy_summers You're *not* gonna kill these people.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Why not?
buffy_summers Because it's wrong.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 You're the slayer.
buffy_summers The one and only.
Policeman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 You people, get out of here!
willow_rosenberg We've gotta get inside.
Policeman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 The police are handling this. Just back off right now.
willow_rosenberg But we can't, we've gotta, Y- you don't understand.
Policeman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Listen you have to clear the area.
rupert_giles Damn it, man, we have to get inside. Our, um, uh uh families are in there. Our, um, mothers and-and tiny, tiny babies.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 You think we're afraid of you? We're not afraid Of anything anymore.
buffy_summers Then let all these people go, and all three of you can take me on.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode16 Heh. I got a better idea.
riley_finn You forgot your coat.

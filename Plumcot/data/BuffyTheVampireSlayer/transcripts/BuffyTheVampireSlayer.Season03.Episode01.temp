Willow That's right, Big Boy.
Willow Come and get it.
Xander I got him! Go!
Xander Any time now . . .
Willow He's getting away! And . . . ow.
Oz That really never works.
Oz Are you guys all right?
Xander First of all, what was with the acrobatics? How did that happen?
Oz Wasn't Andy Hoelich on the gymnastics team?
Xander That's right, he was! Cheater!
Xander Okay, and the, uh, second problem I'm having . . . 'Come and get it, Big Boy'?
Willow Well . . . W-well, the Slayer always says a pun or-or a witty play on words, and I think it throws the vampires off, and, and it makes them *frightened* because I'm wisecracking. Okay, I didn't really have a chance to work on that one, but *you* try it every time.
Oz Uh, if I may suggest: 'This time it's personal.' I mean, there's a reason why it's a classic.
Xander I've always been amazed with how Buffy fought, but . . . in a way, I feel like we took her punning for granted.
Willow Xander, past tense rule.
Xander Oh, sorry. I just meant we in the past took it for granted and, uh . . . we won't when she gets back.
Willow Do you think Buffy knows school's starting tomorrow?
Oz Tomorrow. Right. Big day.
Willow Oh, I'm gonna be busy a lot. But, but only till 3:00, and that's when you usually get up.
Xander I can't wait to see Cordelia. I can't believe I can't wait to see Cordelia.
Willow I wonder what our first homework assignment's gonna be.
Willow Hey, you're excited over Cordelia, okay? We've all got issues.
Oz I guess we should pack it in.
Xander Yeah.
Willow Wouldn't it be great if Buffy just showed up tomorrow? Like nothing happened?
Xander She can't just show up, she got kicked out.
Willow Well, yeah, I-I know. I just wish . . . I wish we knew where she was.
Buffy How did you find me here?
Angel If I was blind, I would see you.
Buffy Stay with me.
Angel Forever. That's the whole point. I'll never leave. Not even if you kill me.
Buffy Anything else?
Roughneck That'll do us, Peaches.
Buffy Pay at the counter.
Roughneck Sure you don't want me to work it off for you?
Buffy You guys ready?
Rickie Yeah. I think we're good. Um . . . 'Anne'.
Buffy What'll you have?
Rickie Well, okay . . . What can we get with this?
Buffy Um . . .
Lily Can we get cake?
Rickie Don't be stupid. We gotta eat healthy. We can't have cake. Can we get pie?
Buffy We've got a peach pie. I can't guarantee there's a peach in it.
Lily We shouldn't have blown all our money.
Rickie Come on, it was worth it.
Rickie Hey, check this out.
Buffy It's nice. It's nice and, uh, permanent.
Rickie Yeah, forever. I mean, that's the whole point.
Lily Hey, do I know you?
Buffy I don't think so.
Lily Really? Where're you from?
Buffy I'll get your pie.
Buffy I'm not feeling great. Do you think you can cover for me?
Waitress Sure. Okay.
Giles So, no joy at the cemetery?
Willow No, he got away. We still have some glitches in the system, like . . . vampires getting away. But I think we're improving.
Giles For God's sake be careful. I mean, uh, I appreciate your efforts to keep the vampire population down until Buffy returns, but, uh . . . Well, if anything should happen to you and . . . you should be killed, I should take it somewhat amiss.
Willow You'd be cranky?
Giles Entirely.
Willow Well, we try not to get killed. That's part of our whole mission statement. 'Don't get killed.'
Giles Good, good. I think you're going to love that one.
Willow Hi!
Cordelia Hey, Willow.
Willow How was your summer?
Cordelia Oh, I can't believe you brought that up. Las Palmas was the nightmare resort. They order you around and make you have organized 'fun', and I used sarcastic quote marks. Plus the fact there are cockroaches in Mexico big enough to own property. It was all about dread. How was your summer?
Willow Oh, it was okay.
Cordelia Is Xander around?
Willow Well, uh, yeah. Somewhere.
Cordelia Good. Great. I haven't seen him yet. Do I look okay?
Willow Oh, yeah!
Cordelia How's my hair?
Willow Uh, it's good!
Cordelia He didn't meet anybody over the summer, did he? No, who's he gonna meet in Sunnydale, but monsters and stuff? But then again he's always been attracted to monsters. How's my hair?
Willow Still good.
Willow Hi!
Cordelia Maybe he's forgotten me. Well, I'll just have to make him remember. See ya.
Willow You came to visit me. You came with books? Are they books for me?
Oz Well, actually, they're kind of for me.
Willow I don't get it.
Oz Well, it's sort of a funny story. You remember when I didn't graduate?
Willow Well, I know you had a lot of incompletes, but that's what summer school was for.
Oz Yeah. Well, you remember when I didn't go?
Teacher Whoa. Slow down, people. Summer is over. Be somber.
Willow But you never said anything. How am I supposed to react to this rather alarming news?
Oz Well, actually, I was pretty much banking on you finding it cute.
Willow Well, traditionally, you know, repeating a grade isn't exactly a turn-on. A-and you're practically a genius. You're Mr. Test Scores. I-it's all a little weird.
Oz So the cute thing is out?
Xander Have you guys seen Cordelia?
Willow Yeah. She's around here somewhere.
Xander I don't want to come on too geeky, but, uh, okay, I'm psyched! There's gonna be some heat, if you know what I mean, so you guys might want to duck and cover. And I'm starting to be geeky. Okay, bye. How's my
Willow Your hair is fine.
Xander Cool.
Larry This is our year, I'm telling you. Best football season ever. I'm so in shape, I'm a rock. It's all about egg whites. If we can focus, keep discipline, and not have quite as many mysterious deaths, Sunnydale is gonna *rule*!
Willow I'm trying to get to cute, really. But I'm still sorta stuck on 'strange'.
Oz Well, I'd be willing to bargain down to 'eccentric' with an option on 'cool'.
Xander Hey!
Cordelia Hey.
Xander Good summer?
Cordelia It was all right.
Xander Cool!
Cordelia Yeah.
Xander Well, I'll see ya.
Cordelia Yeah, whatever.
Ken Hey, how are you? Can I talk to you for a moment? I have something you might be interested in.
Homeless_woman I'm no one.
Homeless_woman I'm no one.
Homeless_woman I'm no one.
Giles Yes? Thank you, thank you.
Giles I have a lead.
Giles A friend in Oakland has a-a-a sketchy report of a . . . young girl fending off a group of vampires . . . about a week ago. There's a plane out in about an hour.
Xander And what makes this different from the last nine leads?
Giles Well, I believe there's a meal on this flight.
Xander Look, I don't mean to poop the party here, it's just, you get your hopes all up, and then it's just a big fat raspberry, and I feel bad.
Willow But it's good that you're looking, though. You shouldn't give up.
Xander Oh, yeah. Definitely.
Giles Yes, one must try. Well, I-I-I should go.
Willow You don't think maybe he'll find her?
Xander I think he'll find her when she wants to be found.
Lily Anne?
Lily Anne?
Lily Buffy?
Lily Don't be mad. I won't turn you in or nothing. I guess you don't recognize me.
Buffy Lily?
Lily I mean from before. I was calling myself Chantarelle then. I used to . . . Well, I was in this cult that worshipped vampires. So lame, I know.
Buffy Yeah . . . I, uh, I remember.
Lily But . . . you kinda saved us. I never thanked you or anything.
Buffy Did you tell anyone who I was?
Lily Oh, no! Not-not even Rickie. I mean, I was so surprised to see you here, waiting tables . . . But I wouldn't tell. I know how it is when you gotta get lost.
Buffy Do you, uh, do you live nearby?
Lily Well, there's a couple of places. Uh, they're abandoned, and a lot of people stay there. So how come you came up with Anne?
Buffy It's my middle name.
Lily Lily's from a song. Rickie picked it. I'm always changing anyway. Chantarelle was part of my exotic phase.
Buffy It's nice. It's a . . .it's a mushroom.
Lily It is? That's really embarrassing.
Buffy Um, well, i-it's an exotic mushroom, if that's any comfort.
Lily Well, before that, I was following this loser preacher and calling myself Sister Sunshine.
Buffy What do they call you at home?
Buffy I like Lily.
Lily It's cool for now. Hey, do you have any money?
Lily I didn't mean that like Well, I just mean . . . I know this guy, he's gonna have this kinda rave thing in his basement. We could go. I mean, I could show you if you had 'Cause I'm broke.
Buffy I-I don't think so. I just kind of . . . I want to be alone.
Lily I didn't mean to bug you.
Buffy No! I-I didn't, I didn't mean that, it's just . . . Well, a-a lot of people like that, it's, it's too much.
Buffy I-I do have the money, though, so, why don't you and Rickie go, and then maybe I could meet you some other time
Lily No. It's okay, it's okay. Forget about it. Just
Lily That's not very polite.
Buffy Are you okay?
Homeless_man I'm no one.
Lily Are you okay?
Driver Jeez, I didn't see you.
Lily Oh . . . Maybe, maybe you shouldn't move.
Driver Maybe you should lie down.
Buffy No, I'm fine.
Driver Somebody call an ambulance!
Buffy No! I'm okay, I just . . . I need to go.
Ken Whoa! Oh . . .
Ken Where are you running to?
Buffy Sorry.
Ken Maybe I should ask, where are you running from?
Ken You're pretty new around here. Uh, you've got the 'look', though.
Buffy The 'look'?
Ken Like you had to grow up way too fast. What's your name?
Buffy Anne.
Ken Hey, um, I'm Ken. Here, go ahead, take one of these.
Ken Don't be shy about stopping by. I mean, I guess you're not starving, but . . . we're not just interested in feeding the body. You might find something you're missing.
Buffy I'm alright.
Ken Then why are you here? This is not a good place for a kid to be. You get old fast here. The thing that drains the life out of them is despair. I mean, kids come here, and they got nothing to go home to, and . . . this ends up being the last stop for a lot of them. Shouldn't have to be that way.
Xander Boy, I'm glad we showed up for Depressing Night.
Willow I wonder what she's doing right now.
Xander Oh, I know what she's doing. Gabbing to all of her friends about her passionate affair with Pedro the Cabana Boy, laughing about me, thinking how she still might have feelings about me.
Xander Oh, it's possible you were talking about Buffy.
Willow It's possible. The Bronze just never seems the same without her.
Xander Yeah, and the slaying isn't getting any easier, either.
Oz I don't know. I think we're kinda getting a rhythm down.
Xander We're losing half the vamps.
Oz Yeah, but . . . rhythmically.
Willow We just need to work on our timing, I think.
Xander No, I know what we need.
Oz A Vampire Slayer?
Xander Next best thing.
Xander Bait.
Joyce Uh, hello.
Giles Hello. Um, may I . . .
Joyce Oh, uh, of course. Come on in.
Giles Thank you. I've, uh, just come back from Oakland. A friend of mine called with a lead. Stories about someone fighting vampires. It, uh, didn't pan out, I'm afraid.
Joyce No Buffy.
Giles No vampires. Bunch of school kids in heavy mascara listening to extremely silly music.
Joyce Well, thank you for going. I can hardly, uh . . . I can hardly leave the house. I'm just afraid she'll call and she'll need my help.
Giles Buffy is the most capable child I've ever known. I mean, she may be confused, u-unhappy, but I, uh, honestly believe she's in no danger.
Joyce I just wish I could talk to her. The last thing we did was fight.
Giles Joyce, you mustn't blame yourself for her leaving.
Joyce I don't. I blame you.
Joyce You've been this huge influence on her, guiding her. You had this whole relationship with her behind my back. I feel like you've taken her away from me.
Giles I didn't make Buffy who she is.
Joyce And who exactly is she?
Lily Buffum, Anne? Can I talk to you?
Buffy Look, this really isn't a good time. Can it wait?
Lily Rickie's gone. I haven't seen him for more than a day. Ihe's never left for that long. I think something's . . . happened. Maybe something's happened.
Buffy Well, did you call the police?
Lily Rickie skipped out on his parole. Uh, they would just cause more trouble.
Buffy I don't know, did you, did you ask around?
Lily Can you help me?
Buffy Uh, I-I can't.
Lily But . . . but that's who you are and stuff, right? I mean, you help people, and, you know
Buffy I can't get into this. I'm sorry, Lily.
Lily You, you know how to do stuff.
Buffy I don't. Not anymore.
Lily But . . . I don't know what to do.
Lily We gave blood lots of times 'cause you get a few bucks. And they have cookies!
Buffy You're a fan of the sugar rush?
Lily It's nice.
Nurse Hi. You here to donate blood?
Buffy Uh, we're looking for a friend.
Lily Rickie T.? We come in sometimes.
Nurse Rickie, sure. Uh, he's not here.
Buffy Well, do you know if he's been in the last day or so?
Nurse Well, let me check the sheet.
Man Ow!
Buffy This'll probably go faster if we split up.
Lily Can I come with you?
Buffy Okay, where did I lose you on the whole splitting up thing?
Lily Oh. Sorry.
Buffy I was thinking we could check out some of your hangouts and, um, I guess, meet later at my place.
Lily Okay.
Nurse Sorry, guys. He hasn't been here.
Buffy Thanks.
Nurse I'll tell him you were looking.
Buffy Great.
Buffy Rickie?
Lily Did you find Rickie? I thought ofwell, he likes to go to this movie house, you can get in around the back
Buffy Lily . . . I think he's dead.
Lily But . . . he takes care of me.
Buffy I'm sorry.
Lily We're gonna get a place. His cousin can get him a job at the car wash.
Buffy Lily, there's there's something else. The, the person that I found . . . was old. He-he looked about eighty.
Lily Well, that's not Rickie!
Buffy I'm sure it was. I, I don't know how, but . . . it was like something drained the life out of him.
Lily Do you mean like a vampire?
Buffy No. A vampire couldn't accelerate the aging process. Maybe it was something in his blood. When was the last time you guys gave blood together?
Lily I don't understand. Maybe it's not Rickie, okay?
Buffy Lily, this is something you're just gonna have to deal with.
Lily But he didn't do anything wrong! Why would this happen to him?
Buffy That's *not* the point. These things happen all the time. You can't just . . . close your eyes and hope that they're gonna go away.
Lily Is it 'cause of you?
Buffy What?
Lily You know about . . . monsters and stuff. You could have brought this with you.
Buffy I didn't bring anything with me. And I didn't ask for you to come to me with your problems. I just wanted to be left alone. If you can't deal, then *don't* lay it off on me!
Ken Are you okay?
Ken Hey, it's okay. Maybe I can help.
Lily You can't.
Ken Look, I know you all think I'm a big square handing out leaflets about hope. But hope is a real thing, just like despair. And hope can fill up a part of you that's missing.
Lily But Rickie . . .
Ken Rickie? Say, are you Lily? Right! Right, he was talking about you.
Lily You've seen Rickie?
Ken Oh, sure! Rickie's with us now.
Lily She said he was dead.
Ken Well, someone's sure handed you a tall tale. Rickie's no more dead than I am. Why don't you come to Family Home? We'll get you taken care of.
Buffy Candidate for what?
Nurse What are you doing?
Buffy Breaking into your office and going through your private files. Candidate for what?
Nurse I'm calling the police.
Buffy Now, you've got a whole bunch of candidates here. I wonder if any of them are missing like Rickie. Gosh, I bet they are.
Nurse You're getting yourself in a lot of trouble.
Buffy I don't want any trouble. I just want to be alone and quiet in a room with a chair and a fireplace and a tea cozy. I don't even know what a tea cozy is, but I want one. Instead, I keep getting trouble, which I am more than willing to share. What are you doing with these kids?
Nurse Nothing. I just . . . I give him the names of the healthy ones.
Buffy Give them to who?
Ken Well, don't you look nice?
Lily I guess.
Ken Well, you don't want to wear your own outfit to the cleansing. It'll get soaked.
Lily A cleansing is like a baptism? Right?
Ken Not quite the same.
Lily Will I see Rickie after?
Ken Oh, of course. He's waiting for you. He's very excited.
Cordelia Why do I have to be bait? I'm always bait. Why can't Willow be bait?
Xander He's already seen Willow. And could you complain louder so that all the vampires leave?
Oz I think this is a good spot.
Oz Is everybody packin'?
Oz Let's do it.
Cordelia I'm doing this for Buffy's sake. This has nothing to do with you.
Xander Yeah, like I needed that cleared up. Go away. This is my hiding spot.
Cordelia Where do I hide?
Xander You don't hide. You're bait. Go act baity.
Cordelia What's the plan?
Xander The vampire attacks you.
Cordelia And then what?
Xander The vampire kills you. We watch, we rejoice.
Cordelia Everything's a joke with you.
Xander No, just our relationship.
Cordelia What relationship?
Xander Oh, that's right, I forgot. We actually want to bury that piece of the past, don't we?
Ken We come to this station to wash away the past. Go ahead, kneel.
Ken We let the water run over the sin and the pain and the uncertainty.
Lily It looks kinda . . . dirty.
Ken Yeah.
Buffy You know, I just . . . I woke up, and I looked in the mirror, and I thought, hey, what's with all the sin? I need to change. I'm . . . I'm dirty. I'm, I'm bad with the . . . sex and the envy and that, that loud music us kids listen to nowadays. W Oh, I just suck at undercover. Where's Ken?
Ken This is a private moment. If you could just
Buffy How do you make 'em old, Ken? Do you feed on youth? What's the deal?
Ken Do you really wanna know?
Lily What's going on?
Buffy Lily.
Lily Oh . . .
Ken Oh, my face!
Ken Ow! My face!
Ken Do you have any idea how hard it is to glue that thing on?!
Ken Guards!
Ken Welcome to my world. I hope you like it.
Ken You're never leaving.
Xander Let me just ask you one thing: how long did it take you to forget me? Were you still taxiing down the runway, or was it actually in the cab?
Cordelia Oh, yeah, Mr. Faithful? You probably met up with some hot little Inca Mummy Girl. Yeah! I heard about her.
Willow Help!
Cordelia Xander!
Buffy Oh. Unh . . . Lily?
Lily I always knew I would come here . . . sooner or later. I knew I belonged here.
Buffy Where?
Lily Hell.
Buffy This isn't Hell.
Ken Isn't it?
Buffy Unh . . .
Ken What is Hell but the total absence of hope? The substance, the tactile proof of despair. You're right, Lily. This is where you've been heading all your life. Just like Rickie.
Lily Rickie?
Ken He forgot you. Well, it took him a long time. He remembered your name years after he'd forgotten his own. But, in the end
Lily Years? But
Ken Oh. Uh, interesting thing: time moves more quickly here than in your reality. A hundred long years will pass here. On Earth, it's just a day.
Buffy So you just work us till we're too old and spit us back out.
Ken That's the plan. See, Lily, you'll die of old age before anyone wonders where you went. Not that anyone will, that's why we chose you.
Buffy You didn't choose me.
Ken No. But . . . I know you . . . *Anne*. So afraid. So pathetically determined to run away from whatever it is you used to be. To disappear. Congratulations. You got your wish.
Guard You work, and you live. That is all.
Guard You do not complain or laugh or do anything besides work. Whatever you thought, whatever you were, does not matter. You are no one now. You mean nothing.
Guard Who are you?
Aaron Aaron.
Guard Who are you?
Lily No one.
Guard Who are you?
Boy#2 No one.
Guard Who are you?
Buffy I'm Buffy. The Vampire Slayer. And you are?
Buffy Anyone who's not having fun here, follow me.
Buffy There's no way we can get back up there without meeting new people. Okay. Lily, when those guards leaveand they will leaveI want you to take these people and get them up there, okay? Fast and quiet.
Lily You're leaving me? But
Buffy Lily . . . You can handle this. 'Cause I say so.
Buffy We've gone public. Okay, quick, get them up. Go! Quiet!
Lily I'm sorry I said this was your fault before.
Buffy Lily, this can wait.
Lily Well, in case we die
Buffy Go! Go!
Guard Get out of the way!
Guard Come on, get out of the way!
Lily C'mon, c'mon, everybody go! Go!
Ken Humans don't fight back.
Ken Humans don't fight back!
Ken That's how this works!
Ken Get down there!
Ken One of you fights . . . and you all die!
Ken That . . . was not . . . permitted.
Buffy Yeah, but it was fun.
Ken You've got guts. I think I'd like to slice you open and play with them.
Ken Let everyone know!
Ken *This* is the price of rebellio
Lily They'll be coming.
Buffy Okay . . . this . . . works . . . the abs . . . and . . . the glutes.
Buffy I'm gonna feel this for a week!
Ken You've *ruined* . . . You . . .
Buffy Hey, Ken, wanna see my impression of Gandhi?
Lily Gandhi?
Buffy Well, you know, if he was really pissed off.
Lily What do we do about
Buffy Let me give you the tour.
Buffy This concludes our tour.
Lily It's really nice.
Buffy All the rent's paid up for the next three weeks.
Buffy I spoke to Mitch at the diner. He said you can start on Thursday. He's, uh . . . he's kind of . . . repulsive, but, uh, he won't give you a hard time.
Buffy Um . . . I'll call and check up on you.
Lily I'm not . . . great at taking care of myself.
Buffy Gets easier. Takes practice.
Lily Hey . . .
Lily Can I be 'Anne'?

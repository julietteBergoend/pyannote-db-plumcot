Narrator#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 Hush, a special Buffy
professor_maggie_walsh So this is what it is.. talking about communication talking about language... not the same thing. It's about inspiration... Not the idea, but the moment before the idea when its total. When it blossoms in your mind and connects to everything It's about the thoughts and experiences that we don't have a word for. A demonstration.
professor_maggie_walsh A typical college girl, one assumes.
professor_maggie_walsh Lie down on my desk
buffy_summers what?
professor_maggie_walsh Go ahead, you're perfectly safe.
buffy_summers oh
professor_maggie_walsh Riley, if you could oblige.
riley_finn A demonstration, right/alright.
professor_maggie_walsh Be a good boy.
buffy_summers This feels very strange.
riley_finn Don't worry. If I kiss you it'll make the sun go down.
riley_finn See.
buffy_summers Fortune favors the brave.
buffy_summers do you hear that?
little_girl girl chanting Can't even shout. Can't even cry. The gentlemen are coming by looking in windows knocking on doors. They need to take seven and they might take yours. Can't call to mom can't say a word .You're gonna die screaming but you won't be heard

riley_finn So tell me about your dream.
riley_finn As a psyche major I'm qualified to go 'hmmm'
buffy_summers I don't really remember it
riley_finn Well, did I appear at all in this dream?
buffy_summers there might have been a cameo
riley_finn is that right?
buffy_summers maybe more like a featured role
riley_finn romantically?
buffy_summers I'm not saying a word.
riley_finn So what have you got going on for tonight?
buffy_summers Oh Patrolling
riley_finn Patrolling?

buffy_summers Fortune favors the brave.
rupert_giles Can't even shout. Can't even cry. The gentlemen are coming by. Um, it sounds vaguely familiar. You're sure it's - nothing you heard when you were a child? Oh alright. Nothing else? Well i-it could definitely be one of your prophetic dreams or it could just be the eternal mystery that is your brain. But I-I'll check it out and um, I'll let you know if I find something. Alright. Bye bye.
rupert_giles Have you heard of a group called the gentlemen?
spike Group of what?
rupert_giles The gentlemen.
spike Dunno.
rupert_giles You certain?
spike No. We're out of wheat-a-bits.
rupert_giles We are out of wheat-a-bits because you ate it all - again.
spike Get some more.
rupert_giles I thought vampires were supposed to eat blood.
spike Yep. Well sometimes I like to crumble up the wheat-a-bits in the blood give it a little texture.
rupert_giles Since the picture you just painted means I will never touch food of any kind again you'll just have to pick it up yourself.
spike Sissy.
xander_harris I don't get what this is coming from.
anya well, what am I supposed to think?
xander_harris Well, How could you say I'm using you?
anya You don't care about what I think you don't ask about my day
xander_harris You really did turn into a real girl didn't you?
anya See! You make jokes during my pain. You don't care about me at all
xander_harris I care about you.
anya How much?
anya What do I mean to you?
xander_harris I... we, you know we spend… we'll talk about it later
anya Well I think we should talk about it now.
rupert_giles Thank you for knocking.
xander_harris if you don't know how I feel about
anya I don't. This isn't a relationship you don't need me, all you care about is lots of orgasms.
xander_harris ok... remember how we talked about private conversations and how they're less private when they're in front of my friends
spike Oh, we're not your friends. Go on.
rupert_giles please don't
anya this is important
rupert_giles but why is it here?
xander_harris mom said you wanted me to swing by
rupert_giles Oh, oh yes, well I meant uh after sunset
rupert_giles um I need you to take Spike for a few days
xander_harris What?
spike What?
anya What?
spike I'm not staying with him!
rupert_giles I have a friend who's coming to town and I'd like us to be alone.
anya oh you mean an orgasm friend?
rupert_giles Yes that's exactly the most appalling thing you could have said
xander_harris he's not roaming around - he stays with me he's gonna get tied up again.
anya What about us, our romantic evening?
spike I'm not having these two shag while I'm tied to a chair three feet away
xander_harris That's not exactly one of my fantasies either.
anya so you're blowing off our evening because
xander_harris I don't want him to come either
Wicca1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 We come together, daughters of Gaia, sisters to the moon we walk with the darkness the wolf at our side through the waterfall of power to the blackest heart of eternity. I think we should have a bake sale.
Wicca2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 I don't know
Wicca1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 you guys like a bake sale right? I mean we need money for the dance recital and You know I do an empowering lemon bundt
Wicca2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 The most important thing is the Gaian newsletter we need to get the message of blessing out to the sisters. Also who left their scented candles dripping all over my women power shrine?
willow_rosenberg Well, this is good. I mean, this is all fun ya know, but there's also other stuff that we might show an interest in, as a wicca group.
Wicca1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 like what?
willow_rosenberg Well, There's the wacky notion of spells, you know conjuring, transmutation
wicca2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 Oh yeah, then we could all get on our broomsticks and fly around on our broomsticks
wicca1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 You know certain stereotypes are not very empowering.
wicca#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 3 I think that
wicca2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 one person's energy can suck the power from an entire circle. no offense
wicca#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 3 Well, maybe we could uh.
wicca2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 Yeah, Tara. Guys.. quiet.
wicca2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 do you have a suggestion?
wicca2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 Ok, let's talk about the theme for the bacchanal.
buffy_summers So not stellar, hunh?
willow_rosenberg talk all talk Blah blah Gaia Blah blah moon menstrual lifeforce power thingy you know after a couple of sessions I was hoping we would get into something real but
buffy_summers No actual witches in your witch group
willow_rosenberg No, bunch of wanna blessed bees. you know nowadays every girl with a Henna tattoo and a spice rack thinks she's a sister to the dark ones
buffy_summers Will I'm sorry it was a bust. I know you were looking to go farther in that department
willow_rosenberg I'd just like to float something bigger than a pencil someday hey how's with you and riley. You two seemed pretty snugly after class
buffy_summers see above re talk all talk
willow_rosenberg Do I have to tie you two together?
buffy_summers We almost, but...
willow_rosenberg Well, get with it - I need my vicarious smoochies.
buffy_summers I don't know...
buffy_summers I get nervous and I start babbling and he starts babbling and it's a babblefest. Plus, everytime we talk I have to lie. The slayer thing comes up one way or another. I wish could just come clean.
forrest_gates Well you can't
riley_finn Yeah, I know I can't, but it bugs me this time.
forrest_gates This is the burden we bear, brother. We have a gig that would inevitably cause any girl living to think we are cool upon cool. Yet we must Clark Kent our way through the dating scene never to use our unfair advantage.
forrest_gates Thank God we're pretty.
riley_finn But its just... Buffy's special
forrest_gates You think she's special. Wow. The first 486 times you told me it didn't register but now I 'see' that you think she's special.
riley_finn See, you're naturally inclined to talk too much I don't have that
forrest_gates Then get with the kissing
riley_finn Riley Finn

buffy_summers anything
Television#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 Big news item from Sunnydale California. Apparently the entire town has been quarantined due to an epidemic of, as strange at this may sound,
Laryngitis.#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 It seems the town has been rendered unable to speak there's no word yet what might have caused this or what other effects might be seen from this epidemic local authorities has issued a statement, a written statement, I should say, blaming recent flu vacinations. A few skeptics call it a city wide hoax. In the meanwhile Sunnydale has effectively shut down all schools and businesses will be closed for the time being and residents are advised to stay home and rest up centers for disease control have ordered the entire town quarantined. No one can go in or out until the syndrome is identified or the symptoms disappear. We'll bring you more on that as it develops.
xander_harris that's it
rupert_giles why
Electric#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 voiceBecause there will chaos.
Electric#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode10 voice We are looking into it. Go. Help maintain order. We will find an answer.

riley_finn oh
willow_rosenberg You were there looking for me?
tara_maclay I thought maybe we could do a spell - make people talk again. I'I'd seen you in the group, the wicca group you were... you were different than them. I mean they didn't seem to know...
willow_rosenberg What they were talking about.
tara_maclay I think if they saw a witch they would run the other way.
willow_rosenberg How long have you been practicing?
tara_maclay Always, I mean, since I um, was little... my, my mom used to, She um, she had a lot of power, like you.
willow_rosenberg Oh I'm not lying.. I don't have much in the way of power.
willow_rosenberg Really, I mean most of my potions come out soup Besides... spells going awry, friends in danger… I'm definitely nothing special.
tara_maclay No, you are.
rupert_giles So would you say this was, uh, your best visit ever.
olivia All the time you used to talk to me about witchcraft and darkness and the like - I just thought you were being pretentious.
rupert_giles Oh I was. I was also right.
olivia So everything you told me was true.
rupert_giles Well no, um, I wasn't actually one of the original members of Pink Floyd. But the monster stuff, yes.
olivia Scary.
rupert_giles Too scary?
olivia I don't know.
riley_finn Hi.
buffy_summers Hi.
riley_finn Well, I guess we have to talk.
buffy_summers I guess we do.

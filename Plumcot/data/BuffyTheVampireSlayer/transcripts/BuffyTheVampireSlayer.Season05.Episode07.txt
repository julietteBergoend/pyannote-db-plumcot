buffy_summers You know, it's probably none of my business but I just gotta ask...
buffy_summers You smell this bad when you were alive?
buffy_summers 'Cause if it's a post-mortem thing, then boy, is my face red...
buffy_summers But just so you know, the fast-growing field of personal grooming has come a long way since you became a vampire.
ROCKER_VAMPIRE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 You're going? But you were having so much fun a minute ago!
riley_finn Buffy! What happened?
buffy_summers I can't believe I passed out. Do you think I'm a total wuss now?
riley_finn Oh, yeah. I like a girl who can play a few hard sets of tennis with a major stab wound.
buffy_summers You said it wasn't that bad.
riley_finn I said I've seen worse. There's a difference.
buffy_summers Well, at least no major organs got kebabed.
riley_finn I still think you need to see a real doctor.
buffy_summers That would put me in a real hospital which would get my real mom real freaked out. I can't do it. Don't worry. Accelerated healing powers come with the Slayer package. And the boyfriend who comes complete with combat medical training? That's just a Buffy Summers bonus.
riley_finn So tell me about the bad guy- or guys. What do you think they were?
buffy_summers Vampire.
riley_finn How many?
buffy_summers One.
riley_finn So... what? He was like a super-vampire or something?
buffy_summers No, he was the regular kind. He just beat me.
riley_finn That ever happen before?
buffy_summers I'm in the best physical shape of my life. I mean, if you're asking how it happened, I don't-
buffy_summers Dawn!
dawn_summers Sorry to interrupt the sex-capades. I just wanted to tell you that Mom's coming.
joyce_summers Hi, Riley.
riley_finn Hey, Mrs. Summers. How're you feeling?
joyce_summers I'm fine, bordering on chipper and tomorrow planning on being obnoxious.
riley_finn Glad to hear it.
joyce_summers Buffy, when you have a minute I'd like to go over the grocery list for next week.
buffy_summers You got it.
joyce_summers Are you disinfecting something?
buffy_summers Huh? Oh, uh-
dawn_summers Mine! Some nail polish experiments are doomed before they even begin.
joyce_summers But you keep pushing the envelope, honey.
dawn_summers Did I just pull a Slayer-related Mom cover-up thing? Come on, who's the man?
buffy_summers You are. A very short, annoying man.
buffy_summers If I show you something, you promise you won't tell?
dawn_summers Oh, cool! I mean, gross!
buffy_summers And Mom cannot know. Okay? You'll help me with the household stuff?
dawn_summers Oh, sure. I save your butt and you dump all your chores on me. I got it. You're covered. We're good. Just lucky it's not bikini season.
riley_finn So Dawn takes household duty. I'll take tonight's patrol.
buffy_summers By yourself?
riley_finn Just a sweep.
buffy_summers Do me a favor? Will you take the gang along with?
riley_finn Okay. I will patrol with the group tonight.
dawn_summers When do I get to patrol?
buffy_summers Not until you're never.
xander_harris What's with the hand move? Does that like mean something?
willow_rosenberg It's code. I think it breaks down to "choo-choo".
anya It means to follow him. That, or wait here for him.
willow_rosenberg Ask.
xander_harris Hey, Riley! What's the all about?
riley_finn It means yell real loud so the vampires who don't know we're coming will have a sporting chance.
xander_harris See, now he's all mean and sarcastic.
willow_rosenberg That's because you were doing all the yelling, Mr. Stealthy-Pants.
anya It's their fault.
riley_finn Guys, I'm thinking if we split up, we could cover more ground. Tell you what? I'll take the cemeteries, you guys get the Bronze.
anya Are we not being covert enough?
xander_harris We're sorry!
willow_rosenberg Sorry.
xander_harris We'll be sneakier. Promise.
riley_finn Okay. Just ditch the chips and watch my back.
willow_rosenberg Done.
xander_harris You know what he's like? He's like a cat. You know, a big jungle cat. How come I'm not like that? It's just so cool.
willow_rosenberg I think you're cool.
rupert_giles Here's another one. Early 18th Century Slayer.
buffy_summers Good. Let's hope she'll be more helpful than this last one.
rupert_giles Why? What does it say?
buffy_summers Same as all the others. Slayer called... blah, blah... great protector... blah, blah... scary battles... blah, blah… oops! She's dead. Where are the details?
rupert_giles Details? Well, it says this Slayer forged her own weapons.
buffy_summers Gotta love a gal with an anvil. But where are the details of the Slayer's last battle? You know, what made that fight special? Why did she lose?
rupert_giles You didn't lose last night, Buffy. You just-
buffy_summers Got really close. I slipped up, Giles. I've been training harder than ever and still I... And there's nothing in any of these books to help me understand why. I mean... look, I realize that every Slayer comes with an expiration mark on the package. But I want mine to be a long time from now. Like a Cheeto. If there were just a few good descriptions of what took out the other Slayers, maybe it would help me to understand my mistake, to keep it from happening again.
rupert_giles Yes, well, the problem is after a final battle, it's difficult to get any... well, the Slayer's not... she's rather...
buffy_summers It's okay to use the D-word, Giles.
rupert_giles Dead. And hence not very forthcoming.
buffy_summers Why didn't the Watchers keep fuller accounts of it? The journals just stop.
rupert_giles Well, I suppose if they're anything like me, they just find the whole subject too-
buffy_summers Unseemly? Damn. Love ya but you Watchers are such prigs sometimes.
rupert_giles Painful... I was going to say.
rupert_giles But you're right. Accounts of the final battles would be very helpful. But there's no one left to tell the tales.
rupert_giles What?
spike Ow! Wait. Not ow. You feeling all right, Slayer? This stuff usually hurts.
buffy_summers Don't even start, Spike.
spike What do you want?
buffy_summers Slayers. You killed two of them.
spike I did.
buffy_summers You're gonna show me how.
spike You know, there quite a few American beers that are highly underrated. This unfortunately is not one of them.
buffy_summers Update, Spike. We're not here to discuss the fine choice of hops. It's about two Slayers: one in China during the Boxer Rebellion, one in New York.
buffy_summers Both got killed by you. Tell the tale, you get the cash.
spike Right. You want to learn all about how I bested the Slayers and you want to learn fast. Right, then. We fought. I won. The end. Pay up.
buffy_summers That's not what I-
spike What did you want, eh? A quick demo? A blow-for-blow description you can map out and memorize? It's not about the moves, love. And since I agreed to your little proposition, we can do this my way. Wings.
buffy_summers What?
spike Spicy buffalo wings. Order me up a plate. I'm feelin' peckish.
buffy_summers Excuse me-
spike As I thought. Some nasty thing got a taste of you.
buffy_summers Don't get all excited. I'm fine.
spike Oh, right. Stuck in a dark corner with a creature you loathe, diggin' up past uglies, 'cause you're fine.
buffy_summers Just tell me what I want to know.
spike I told you. No one's narrating on an empty stomach here.
buffy_summers Were you born this big a pain in the ass?
spike What can I tell you, baby? I've always been bad.
spike Luminous... oh, no, no, no. Irradiant's better.
WAITER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 Care for an hors d'oeuvre, sir?
spike Oh, quickly! I'm the very spirit of vexation. What's another word for "gleaming"? It's a perfectly perfect word as many words go but the bother is nothing rhymes, you see.
spike Cecily...
ARISTOCRAT_#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 I mean to point out that it's something of a mystery and the police should keep an open mind.
ARISTOCRAT_#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 Ah, William! Favor us with your opinion. What do you make of this rash of disappearances sweeping through our town? Animals or thieves?
spike I prefer not to think of such dark, ugly business at all. That's what the police are for. I prefer placing my energies into creating things of beauty.
ARISTOCRAT_#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 I see. Well, don't withhold, William.
ARISTOCRAT_#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 Rescue us from a dreary topic.
spike Careful. The inks are still wet. Please, it's not finished.
ARISTOCRAT_#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 Don't be shy. "My heart expands/'tis grown a bulge in it/inspired by your beauty, effulgent." Effulgent?
ARISTOCRAT_#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 And that's actually one of his better compositions.
ARISTOCRAT_#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 Have you heard? They call him William the Bloody because of his bloody awful poetry!
ARISTOCRAT_#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 It suits him. I'd rather have a railroad spike through my head than listen to that awful stuff!
spike Cecily?
CECILY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 Oh. Leave me alone.
spike Oh, they're vulgarians. They're not like you and I.
CECILY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 You and I? I'm going to ask you a very personal question and I demand an honest answer. Do you understand?
CECILY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 Your poetry, it's... they're... not written about me, are they?
spike They're about how I feel.
CECILY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 Yes, but are they about me?
spike Every syllable.
CECILY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 Oh, God!
spike Oh, I know... it's sudden and... please, if they're no good, they're only words but... the feeling behind them... I love you, Cecily.
CECILY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 Please stop!
spike I know I'm a bad poet but I'm a good man and all I ask is that... that you try to see me-
CECILY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 I do see you. That's the problem. You're nothing to me, William. You're beneath me.
spike Watch where you're going!
drusilla And I wonder... what possible catastrophe came crashing down from heaven and brought this dashing stranger to tears?
spike Nothing. I wish to be alone.
drusilla Oh, I see you. A man surrounded by fools who cannot see his strength, his vision, his glory. That and burning baby fish swimming all around your head.
spike That's quite close enough. I've heard tales of London pickpockets. You'll not be getting my purse, I tell you.
drusilla Don't need a purse.
drusilla Your wealth lies here... and here. In the spirit and... imagination. You walk in worlds the others can't begin to imagine.
spike Oh, yes! I mean, no. I mean... mother's expecting me.
drusilla I see what you want. Something glowing and glistening. Something... effulgent.
spike Effulgent.
drusilla Do you want it?
spike Oh, yes! God, yes.
riley_finn Guys...
xander_harris What you got?
riley_finn That's him. Let's go.
xander_harris It sounds like a party in there.
riley_finn Forget about crashing. There's too many of them. We'll come back at daybreak when they're asleep and we're better armed. It's okay. We can kill them just as dead in the morning.
buffy_summers So you traded up on the food chain. Then what?
spike No, please. Don't make it sound like something you'd flip past on the Discovery Channel. Becoming a vampire is a profound and powerful experience. I could feel this new strength coursing through me. Getting killed made me feel alive for the very first time. I was through living by society's rules. Decided to make a few of my own. Of course, in order to do that... I had to get myself a gang.
angel Perhaps it's my advancing years that makes me so forgetful, William. Remind me. Why don't we kill you?
spike ...ike.
angel What's that?
spike It's Spike now.
spike You'd do well to remember it, mate.
angel I'm not your mate. And when did you start talking like that?
darla Look, we barely got out of London alive because of you. Everywhere we go, it's the same story and now-
angel You've got me and my women hiding in the luxury of a mine shaft, all because William the Bloody likes the attention. This is not a reputation we need.
spike Oh, I'm sorry. Did I sully our good name? We're vampires.
angel All the more reason to use a certain amount of finesse.
spike Bollocks! That stuff's for the frilly cuffs-and-collars crowd. I'll take a good brawl any day.
angel And every time you do, we become the hunted.
darla I think our boys are going to fight.
drusilla The King of Cups expects a picnic! But this is not his birthday.
darla Good point...
spike Yeah, you know what I prefer to being hunted? Getting caught.
angel That's a brilliant strategy really... pure cunning.
spike Sod off! Come on. When was the last time you unleashed it? All out fight in a mob, back against the wall, nothing but fists and fangs? Don't you ever get tired of fights you know you're going to win?
angel No. A real kill. A good kill. It takes pure artistry. Without that, we're just animals.
spike Poofter!
spike Now you're gettin' it!
angel You can't keep this up forever. If I can't teach you, maybe someday an angry crowd will. That... or the Slayer.
spike What's a Slayer?
spike After that, I was obsessed. I mean, to most vampires, the Slayer was the subject of cold sweat and frightened whispers. But I never hid. Hell, I sought her out. I mean, if you're looking for fun, there's death, there's glory and sod all else, right? I was young.
buffy_summers So how'd you kill her?
spike Funny you should ask.
spike Lesson the first: a Slayer must always reach for her weapon.
spike I've already got mine.
spike A good thing, too. Become a vampire, you've got nothing to fear. Nothing but one girl. That's you, honey. Back then... it was her.
spike Just like I pictured it. This good for you?
chinese_slayer Tell my mother I'm sorry...
spike I'm sorry, love, I don't speak Chinese.
spike A fella could get used to this.
drusilla Oh, Spike, look at the wonderful mess you've made. That's a Slayer you've done in. Naughty... wicked… Spike.
spike You ever hear them saying the blood of a Slayer is a powerful aphrodisiac?
spike Here, now... have a taste.
darla So where have you two been?
drusilla May I tell?
spike No need to be humble.
drusilla My little Spike just killed himself a Slayer.
angel Congratulations. I guess that makes you one of us.
spike Don't be so glum, mate! The way you tell it, one Slayer snuffs it, another one rises. I figure there's a new Chosen One getting all chosen as we speak. I tell you what... when and if this new bird does show up, I'll give you first crack at her.
drusilla I smell fear.
angel Yeah, this whole place reeks of it.
drusilla It's intoxicating!
angel Let's get out of here. This rebellion's starting to bore me.
spike That was the best night of my life.
spike And I've had some sweet ones. What are you looking at?
buffy_summers You got off on it.
spike Well, yeah. I suppose you're telling me you don't? How many of my kind reckon you've done?
buffy_summers Not enough.
spike And we just keep coming. But you can kill a hundred, a thousand, a thousand thousand and the enemies of Hell besides and all we need is for one of us- just one- sooner or later to have the thing we're all hoping for.
buffy_summers And that would be what?
spike One... good... day.
spike Hey! You asked and I'm tellin'. The problem with you, Summers, is you've gotten so good, you're starting to think you're immortal.
buffy_summers Not really. I just know I can handle myself.
spike Oh? Then how do you explain this?
buffy_summers So that's it? Lesson over?
spike Not even close. Come on.
ROCKER_VAMPIRE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 Killed with her own weapon!
ROCKER_VAMPIRE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode07 They ought to put this in a museum!
riley_finn You know what they put in museums? Mostly dead things.
buffy_summers Give it to me.
buffy_summers What?
spike Lesson the second: ask the right questions. You want to know how I beat 'em?
spike The question isn't "How'd I win?". The question is "Why'd they lose?".
buffy_summers What's the difference?
spike There's a big difference, love.
buffy_summers How'd you kill the second one?
spike Hmm? A bit like this.
buffy_summers That didn't hurt?
spike I knew I couldn't touch you. If there's no intent to hurt you, then that chip they shoved up my brain never activates. If, on the other hand...
spike See, now that hurt.
buffy_summers Yeah? This hurt too?
buffy_summers How'd you kill 'em, Spike?
spike You're not ready to know.
buffy_summers I'm ready.
spike Okay, then. Went like this.
spike The first was all business but the second, she had a touch of your style.
spike She was cunning, resourceful... oh, did I mention? Hot. I could have danced all night with that one.
buffy_summers You think we're dancing?
spike That's all we've ever done.
spike And the thing about the dance is, you never get to stop.
spike Every day you wake up, it's the same bloody question that haunts you: is today the day I die?
spike Death is on your heels, baby, and sooner or later it's gonna catch you.
spike And part of you wants it... not only to stop the fear and uncertainty, but because you're just a little bit in love with it.
spike Death is your art. You make it with your hands, day after day.
spike That final gasp. That look of peace. Part of you is desperate to know: What's it like? Where does it lead you? And now you see, that's the secret. Not the punch you didn't throw or the kicks you didn't land. Every Slayer... has a death wish.
spike Even you.
spike The only reason you've lasted as long as you have is you've got ties to the world... your mum, your brat kid sister, the Scoobies. They all tie you here but you're just putting off the inevitable.
spike Sooner or later, you're gonna want it. And the second- the second- that happens...
spike You know I'll be there. I'll slip in... have myself a real good day.
spike Here endeth the lesson. I just wonder if you'll like it as much as she did.
buffy_summers Get out of my sight. Now.
spike Oh... did I scare ya? You're the Slayer. Do something about it. Hit me. Come on. One good swing. You know you want to.
buffy_summers I mean it.
spike So do I. Give it me good, Buffy. Do it!
buffy_summers Spike...
buffy_summers What the hell are you doing?
spike Come on. I can feel it, Slayer. You know you want to dance.
buffy_summers Say it's true. Say I do want to.
buffy_summers It wouldn't be you, Spike. It would never be you.
buffy_summers You're beneath me.
harmony_kendall Spike, what are you doing?
spike Beneath me... I'll show her.
spike Put her six bloody feet beneath me. Hasn't got a death wish? Bitch won't need one.
harmony_kendall Okay, I'm trying to be supportive here so don't drive a stake through my heart like last time, but you can't kill Buffy. She's the Slayer. She is so gonna kick your ass.
spike I've got two barrels here that'll prove you wrong.
harmony_kendall I knew you'd take this personally. You are so sensitive! How are you going to kill her? Think! The second you even point that thing at her, you're gonna be all ahhh!
harmony_kendall And then you'll get bitch-slapped up and down Main Street unless she's had enough and just stakes you!
spike Sure, it'll hurt like hell for about two hours...
spike But she'll be dead just a little longer than that.
harmony_kendall Fine! But don't come crying to me when you fail. You couldn't kill her before you got the chip. You had plenty of chances!
drusilla Why can't you kill her?
spike You're the one who keeps bringing her up!
spike I haven't said a word about the bloody Slayer since we left California. She's on the other side of the planet, Dru!
drusilla But you're lying! I can still see her floating all around you, laughing. Why? Why won't you push her away?
spike But I did, pet. I did it for you. You keep punishing me. Carrying on with creatures like this.
chaos_demon Okay, you guys obviously have a thing going on here.
drusilla I have to find my pleasures, Spike. You taste like ashes.
spike So this is my fault now?
chaos_demon I didn't know she was seeing somebody. I should take off.
spike Yeah, why don't you do that?
drusilla You can't blame the ghoul, Spike. You're all covered with her. I look at you... all I see is the Slayer.
buffy_summers Hey, I put together that grocery list for you.
joyce_summers Oh, great. Thanks, hon.
buffy_summers Are you okay?
joyce_summers I'm fine. Have you seen my conditioner?
buffy_summers Did you look under the sink?
buffy_summers Where are you going?
joyce_summers Oh, I was hoping to put this off but... you know the nothing that I've been dealing with the last couple of weeks? It might not be nothing.
buffy_summers What is it?
joyce_summers I'm staying overnight at the hospital for observation. I'm getting a CAT scan.
joyce_summers It's only one night and they say even if there is something, it's still very early if they didn't see it before. I'm going to be fine.
buffy_summers I know you will.
buffy_summers What do you want now?
spike What's wrong?
buffy_summers I don't want to talk about it.
spike Is there something I can do?

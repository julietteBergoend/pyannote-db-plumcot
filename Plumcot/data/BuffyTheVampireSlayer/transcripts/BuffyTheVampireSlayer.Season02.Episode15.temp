Willow Hi.
Oz Oh, that's what I was gonna say.
Willow What cha looking at?
Oz This cheerleading trophy. It's like its eyes follow you wherever you go. I like it.
Willow So did you like the movie last night?
Oz I don't know. T-today's movies are kind of like popcorn. You know, you forget about them as soon as they're done. I do remember I liked the popcorn, though.
Willow Yeah, it was good. And I had a really fun time with the rest. I mean, the part with you.
Oz Oh, that's great. Uh, my time was also of the good.
Willow Mine, too. Well, then...
Willow Oh, there. I have my friend. So I will go to her.
Oz I'll see you then. Uh, later.
Larry Man! Oz, I would love to get me some of that Buffy and Willow action, if you know what I mean.
Oz That's great, Larry. You've really mastered the single entendre.
Girl Hey!
Larry Oops!
Larry Ohhh! Oh, thank you, Thighmaster!
Larry So, Oz, man, what's up with that? Dating a junior? Uh, let me guess. That little innocent schoolgirl thing is just, uh, just an act, right?
Oz Yeah. Yeah, she's actually an evil mastermind. It's fun.
Larry I mean, she's gotta be putting out, or what's the point? What are you gonna do, talk? Come on, fess up. How far have you gotten?
Willow Nowhere. I mean, he said he was gonna wait until I was ready, but I'm ready. Honest. I'm good to go here.
Buffy Well, I think it's nice that he's not just being an animal.
Willow It is nice. He's great. We have a lot of fun. But I want smoochies!
Buffy Have you dropped any hints?
Willow I've dropped anvils.
Buffy Ah, he'll come around. What guy could resist your wily Willow charms?
Willow At last count, all of them. Maybe more.
Buffy Well, none of them know a thing. They all get an 'F' in Willow.
Willow But I want Oz to get an 'A', and, oh, one of those gold stars.
Buffy He will.
Willow Well, he better hurry. I don't want to be the only girl in school without a real boyfriend.
Willow Oh, I'm such an idiot. I'm sorry. I-I shouldn't even be talking about... Do you want me to go away?
Buffy I wish you wouldn't.
Willow How are you holding up anyway?
Buffy I'm holding. I was going on two minutes there without thinking about Angel.
Willow Well, there you go.
Buffy But I would do a lot better if you and Xander and I could do that 'sharing our misery' thing tonight.
Willow Great. I'll give Xander a call. What's his number? Oh, yeah, 1-800-I'm-Dating-A-Skanky-Ho.
Buffy Meow!
Willow Really? Thanks. I've never gotten a 'meow' before.
Buffy Well-deserved.
Willow Darn tootin'. I'm just saying Xander and Cordelia? I mean, what does he see in her anyway?
Xander But what could she possibly see in him?
Cordelia Excuse me? We didn't come here to talk about Willow. We came here to do things I can never tell my father about because he still thinks I'm a... good girl.
Xander I just don't trust Oz with her. I mean, he's a senior, he's attractive okay, maybe not to me, but and he's in a band. And we know what kind of element that attracts.
Cordelia I've dated lots of guys in bands.
Xander Thank you.
Cordelia Do you even wanna be here?
Xander I'm not running away.
Cordelia Because when you're not babbling about poor, defenseless Willow, you are *raving* about the all-powerful Buffy.
Xander I do not babble. I occasionally run-on, every now and then I yammer...
Cordelia Xander?
Xander Yeah?
Cordelia Look around. We're in my daddy's car, it's just the two of us, there is a beautiful, big full moon outside tonight. It doesn't get more romantic than this. So shut up!
Xander Did you hear that?
Cordelia What is it now?
Xander I thought I heard something.
Cordelia I-is Willow sending out some sorta distress signal that only *you* can hear?
Xander Huh.
Xander Okay, now I *know* I heard something.
Cordelia Alright, that's it. You know, your mind hasn't been here all night. How about I just drop you off...
Xander Get us outta here!
Cordelia Where are the keys?
Xander We should be moving! Let's go!
Cordelia Oh, I got 'em! Got 'em!
Xander Told ya I heard something.
Buffy And you're sure it was a werewolf?
Xander Well, let's see, um, six feet tall, claws, a big old snout in the middle of his face like a wolf. Um, yeah, I'm sticking with my first guess.
Oz Seems wise.
Xander Oh, oh, and then there was that little thing where it tried to bite us.
Cordelia It was so awful.
Xander I know.
Cordelia Daddy just had this car detailed.
Buffy So what's the word?
Giles Well, it seems there were a, a number of other attacks by a wild dog around town. Several animal carcasses were found mutilated.
Willow You mean, like bunnies and stuff? No, don't tell me.
Oz Oh, don't worry. I mean, they might not look it, but bunnies can really take care of themselves.
Willow Yeah.
Oz Yeah.
Giles Yes, uh, um, fortunately, no people were injured.
Buffy That falls into the 'that's a switch' column.
Giles Well, for now. But my guess is that this werewolf will be back at next month's full moon.
Willow What about tonight's full moon?
Giles Pardon?
Willow Well, last night was the night before the full moon, traditionally known as... 'the night before the full moon.'
Giles Meaning the accepted legend that werewolves only prowl during a full moon might be erroneous.
Cordelia Or it could be a crock.
Xander Unless the werewolf was using last year's almanac.
Buffy Looks like Giles has some schooling to do.
Giles Yes, I must admit I, I am intrigued. Werewolves, it's... it's one of the classics. I, I'm sure my books and I are in for a fascinating afternoon.
Buffy He needs to get a pet.
Coach Sunnydale is becoming more dangerous all the time. And a full moon like tonight tends to bring out the crazies, but with some simple basics of self-defense each of you can learn how to protect yourself.
Buffy Here's a suggestion: move away from the Hellmouth.
Coach What you wanna do is gain advantage of the situation as quickly as possible.
Oz Tag.
Coach Your attacker may have the benefit of surprise.
Xander Would you look at that? He's all over her.
Coach But if you plot ahead,...
Xander Psst! Hey, buddy, this is a public forum here.
Coach ...then you can turn that advantage to yourself.
Cordelia I think you splashed on just a little too much 'Obsession For Dorks'.
Coach By being prepared, you have the power. Okay, everyone get into your assigned groups.
Xander What happened?
Larry Oh, last week some huge dog jumped out of the bushes and bit me. Thirty-nine stitches. They oughta shoot those strays.
Oz I've been there, man. My cousin Jordy just got his grownup teeth in? Does not like to be tickled.
Larry Theresa! Be still my shorts. We're in the same group. I may have to attack you.
Theresa No, a-a-actually, I think, uh, in our group there are a few of us.
Buffy And I'm one of the few.
Willow Don't forget, you're supposed to be a meek little girlie-girl like the rest of us.
Buffy Spoil my fun.
Coach Okay, everyone, listen up. I wanna show you what to do should you be attacked from behind. In this situation, bend forward, using your back and shoulders to flip the assailant over to the ground.
Buffy Uhh! Uhh!
Larry Oh, Summers, you are turning me on.
Oz That works, too.
Giles And, uh, while there's absolutely no scientific explanation for lunar effect on the human psyche, uh, the phases of the moon, uh, do seem to exert a great deal of psychological influence. And th-the full moon is, is, seems to bring out our darkest qualities.
Xander And yet, ironically, uh, led to the invention of the moon pie.
Giles Oh... Yes, the moon pie. Y-you see, uh, the-the werewolf, uh, is such a, a potent e-e-extreme representation of our inborn animalistic traits that it e-emerges for three full consecutive nights: the full moon and, uh, the two nights surrounding it.
Xander Quite the party animal.
Giles Quite. And it, uh, acts on-on pure instinct. No conscience, uh, uh, predatory and, and aggressive.
Buffy In other words, your typical male.
Xander On behalf of my gender, hey.
Giles Yes, let's not jump to any conclusions.
Buffy I didn't jump. I took a tiny step, and there conclusions were.
Giles The point is that our wolfman could also be a-a-a wolfwoman, or-or anyone who was bitten by a werewolf.
Xander So then I'm guessing your standard silver bullets are in order here?
Giles No. No bullets. No matter who this werewolf is, i-it's still a human being, who may be completely unaware of his or her condition.
Buffy So tonight we bring 'em back alive.
Giles Anything yet?
Buffy Yes. And you won't believe what I saw. Brittany Podell was making out with Owen Stadeel, but he goes with Barrett Williams. If she ever found... No, um, no, no sign of the werewolf. How about you?
Giles Uh, the same. I thought we might, uh... I thought we might knock on a few windows, uh, ask if anyone has seen anything yet.
Buffy Giles, no one's seen anything.
Giles Oh, yes. No, of-of-of course not, no. Yes.
Cain Gotcha!
Cain What the hell?
Buffy Giles! Giles!
Giles Hey! Whoa!
Cain Hands are good right about there.
Giles Who, who are you? What are you doing?
Cain The name's Cain. I'm the one with the gun, which means I'm the one who gets to do the interviewing.
Buffy Ahem. Hey, before we get all chummy here, how about we do something about me being in this net thing?
Giles You alright?
Buffy Yeah.
Cain Gotta say, I'm impressed.
Giles Excuse me?
Cain Well, it's good to get the fruit while it's fresh.
Giles You'd be wise to take that back.
Cain Hey, what a man and a girl do in lovers' lane at night is nobody's busi...
Buffy Oh, okay, hey, enough, repulsive brain. It's not what you think. We're hunting werewolves.
Buffy Okay, it's funny if you don't believe in werewolves.
Cain No, it's funny thinking about you two catching one. I mean, this guy looks like he's auditioning to be a librarian, and, you, well, you're a girl.
Giles I assure you she's quite capable.
Cain Uh-huh. Lemme ask you something, sweetheart. Exactly how many of these animals have you taken out?
Buffy As of today?
Cain I tore a tooth from the mouth of every werewolf that I killed. This next one will bring the total to an even dozen.
Buffy So you're just gonna kill it?
Cain Well, see, that's the thing. Their pelts fetch a pretty penny in Sri Lanka, and it's a little hard to skin 'em when they're alive.
Giles Y-you hunt werewolves f-for sport?
Cain No, no, I'm in it purely for the money.
Buffy And it doesn't bother you that a werewolf is a person twenty-eight days out of the month?
Cain That's why I only hunt 'em the other three. I'd really love to stay and chat, but I'm on a tight schedule. Any idea where else the boys and girls like to get together around here?
Buffy You're looking for a party?
Cain No, but the werewolf is. They're suckers for that whole sexual heat thing. Sense it miles away. Since this little doggie ain't here, I guess he found another place.
Buffy Sorry. Wish I could help you.
Cain But you don't know squat? Gee, what a surprise.
Giles Where are we going?
Buffy I think I know where to look. We just have to make it there before mein furrier.
Angelus Everything okay?
Theresa Yeah, I just, uh, I, I thought I heard something... behind me.
Angelus No one there.
Theresa Oh. I guess I was wrong. I could have sworn that...
Angelus It's okay. It can get pretty scary out here, all alone at night.
Theresa Yeah.
Angelus Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Don't you go to school with Buffy?
Theresa Oh, you know Buffy?
Angelus Yes, I do, very well.
Theresa Oh.
Angelus Come on, I'll get you home.
Cordelia I mean, with Xander it's always, 'Buffy did this', 'Willow said that'. Buffy, Buffy. Willow, Willow. It's like I don't even exist.
Willow I sometimes feel like that.
Cordelia And then when I call him on it, he acts all confused, like I'm the one with the problem.
Willow His 'do I smell something?' look.
Cordelia All a part of his little guy games. It's like he's there, but then he's not there, and he wants it, but then he doesn't want it.
Willow He's so busy looking around at everything he doesn't have, he doesn't even realize what he *does* have.
Cordelia Well, he should at least realize that you have Oz.
Willow Mm, I'm not sure I do. Oz and I are in some sort of holding pattern, except without the holding or... anything else.
Cordelia What's he waiting for? What's his problem? Oh, that's right, he's a guy.
Willow Yeah, him and Xander. Guys.
Cordelia Who do they think they are?
Willow A couple of guys.
Giles Looks as though your hunch was right.
Buffy Who could resist Sunnydale's own house of hormones?
Willow The werewolf, it's in there.
Buffy Coming through!
Cain You let it get away.
Buffy I didn't let it do anything. I had the chain around its neck.
Cain Chain? What were you gonna do, take it for a walk?
Buffy I was going to lock it up.
Cain That's beautiful. This is what happens when a woman tries to do a man's job.
Giles Now, you look here, Mr. Cain. This girl risked her life trying to capture a beast that you haven't as yet been able to find.
Cain Uh-huh. And Daddy's doing a great job carrying her bag of milk bones.
Cain You know, sis, if that thing out there harms anyone, it's going to be on your pretty little head. I hope you can live with that.
Buffy I live with that every day.
Cain First they tell me I can't hunt an elephant for its ivory... Now I've gotta deal with People for the Ethical Treatment of Werewolves.
Giles Pillock! Right, let's move out.
Buffy Giles?
Buffy Giles!
Giles Uhh!
Buffy I didn't see you there. I thought something had happened.
Giles Oh, no, I'm, uh...
Giles I'm okay. I'm just, um, fine... uh, just, uh, I'm, uh.... Uh, any sign of the, uh, werewolf?
Buffy No. I'm guessing you didn't see anything either from that vantage point of having your eyes closed.
Giles It's, uh, it's, it's, uh, gonna be light soon, so we'd better...
Buffy Wait.
Radio_newscaster Police say that the incident was apparently connected to the animal mutilation which occurred two nights ago. The coroner's office has identified the body as that of Sunnydale High School student Theresa Klusmeyer, age seventeen. The authorities ask that anyone with further information...
Giles Buffy, we're gonna get this thing. We have another whole night. There's nothing more we can do now. It's nearly sunrise. That werewolf won't be a werewolf much longer.
Oz Huh.
Oz Aunt Maureen. Hey, it's me. Um, what? Oh! It's, uh... actually it's healing okay. That's pretty much the reason I called. Um, I wanted to ask you something. Is Jordy a werewolf? Uh-huh. And how long has that been going on? Uh-huh. What? No, no reason. Um... Thanks. Yeah, love to Uncle Ken.
Buffy I can't believe I let that thing get away. Cain was right. I shoulda killed it when I had the chance.
Oz Killed what?
Buffy Uh, the, uh, the werewolf. It-it-it was out last night.
Oz Is everybody okay? Did anyone get bitten or, or scratched?
Willow No, we're fine.
Oz Gladness.
Buffy Yeah, but he got someone. Theresa.
Oz 'Got', as in...
Oz Oh, I'm sorry.
Buffy And I coulda stopped it.
Giles Well, we, we have one more night.
Oz Another night?
Buffy Oh, yeah. Believe me, I'm gonna give that wolfie something to howl about.
Oz Hmm.
Xander But while we hang here doing nothing, there's a human werewolf walking around out there, probably making fun of us.
Willow The way werewolves always do.
Oz But there's really no way to tell who it is.
Xander Oh, sure there is. Giles knows stuff, and I'm practically an expert on the subject.
Willow On account of once you were a hyena?
Xander I know what it's like to crave the taste of freshly killed meat, to be taken over by those uncontrollable urges.
Buffy You said you didn't remember anything about that.
Xander I said I didn't remember anything about that. Look, the point is, is I have an affinity with this thing. I can get inside of its head. I'm a big, bad wolf. I'm on the prowl. I'm sniffing, I'm snarling, I'm a slobbering predator, I'm... Wait a second! It's right in front of us. It's obvious who I am. I'm Larry! The guy's practically got wolf-boy stamped on his forehead. You got the dog bite, you got the aggression, not to mention the excessive back hair.
Buffy And he was awfully gleeful about tormenting Theresa.
Giles Still, that doesn't necessarily mean that...
Xander I'm gonna go talk to him. Gonna force a confession out of him.
Giles Good. Go. Uh, in the meantime, we need to cover our bases. Willow, um, check the student files. See if anybody else fits the profile. Uh, Buffy?
Buffy Where are we going?
Giles I-if none of that works, I think I may have an alternative.
Buffy Yeah, me and the werewolf alone in a cage for three minutes. That's all I ask.
Willow Are you okay?
Oz What?
Willow You kind of knew Theresa.
Oz Oh, yeah, I, uh, I'm trying not to think about it. It's... it's a lot.
Willow It is. But we can do stuff to help. Sometimes it feels good to help.
Oz Uh-huh.
Willow Well, like... looking up stuff. I'm gonna be doing that most of the night. You could help me, help together?
Oz I can't. Um, uh, I'm busy.
Willow Oh. So...
Oz I... I gotta go.
Larry Harris. Sheesh. Next time wear a bell.
Xander Why so jumpy, Larry?
Larry Geeks make me nervous.
Xander Is that really it or is there something you're hiding?
Larry I could hide my fist in your face.
Xander I know your secret, big guy. I know what you've been doing at night.
Larry You know, Harris, that nosey little nose of yours is going to get you into trouble someday... Like today.
Xander Hurting me isn't gonna make this go away. People are still gonna find out.
Larry Alright. What do you want? Hush money? Is that what you're after?
Xander I don't *want* anything! I just wanna help!
Larry What, you think you have a cure?
Xander No, it's just... I know what you're going through because I've been there. That's why I know you should talk about it.
Larry Yeah, that's easy for *you* to say. I mean, you're nobody. I've got a reputation here.
Xander Larry, please, before someone else gets hurt.
Larry Look, if this gets out, it's over for me. I mean, forget about playing football. They'll run me outta this town. I mean, come on! How are people going to look at me after they find out I'm gay.
Larry Oh, wow. I said it. And it felt... okay. I'm gay. I am gay.
Xander I heard you the first time.
Larry I can't believe it. It was almost easy. I never felt I could tell anyone. And then you, you of all people, you bring it outta me.
Xander It probably would have slipped out even if I wasn't here.
Larry No, no, because knowing you went through the same thing, made it easier for me to admit it.
Xander The same thing...
Larry It's ironic. I mean, all those times I beat the crap out of you, it musta been because I recognized something in you that I didn't want to believe about myself.
Xander Larry, no, I am not...
Larry Of course, of course not. Don't worry. I wouldn't do that to you. Your secret's safe with me.
Larry Wow.
Buffy So what's the scuttlebutt? Anybody besides Larry fit our werewolf profile?
Willow There is one name that keeps getting spit out. Aggressive behavior, run-ins with authorities, about a screenful of violent incidents.
Buffy Okay, most of those were not my fault. Somebody else started 'em. I was just standing up for myself.
Willow They say it's a good idea to count to ten when you're angry.
Buffy One... Two... Three...
Willow I'll keep looking.
Buffy I, um... noticed you were looking solo.
Willow Yeah. Oz wanted to be someplace that was away... from me.
Buffy I'm sorry.
Willow I can't figure him out. I mean, he's so hot and cold. Or luke-warm and cold.
Buffy Welcome to the mystery that is men. I think it goes something like, they grow body hair, they lose all ability to tell you what they really want.
Willow It doesn't seem like a fair trade.
Buffy Well, if you wanna up the speed quotient with Oz, maybe you need to do something daring. Maybe you need to make the first move.
Willow Well, that won't make me a slut?
Buffy I think your reputation will remain intact.
Willow It used to be so much easier to tell if a boy liked you. He'd punch you on the arm and then run back to his friends.
Buffy Those were the days.
Xander Hey.
Willow I'll see you guys later. Cordelia asked me to look over her history homework before class. I think that means I might have to *do* it.
Xander Wow, those two gals are hanging out a lot together. This would be a good time to panic.
Buffy So how'd it go with Larry?
Xander What's that supposed to mean?
Buffy I think it's supposed to mean, 'so how'd it go with Larry'?
Xander He's not the werewolf. Can't we just leave it at that? Must you continue to *push* and *push*?
Buffy I'm sorry. I was just wondering.
Xander Well, he's not.
Buffy Okay.
Xander Okay.
Buffy But there goes our lead suspect. Which then puts us right back at square boned.
Xander You're not boned, you're Buffy. Eradicator of evil. Defender of, um... things that need defending.
Buffy Tell that to Theresa. She could have used my defending before she was ripped apart by that...
Xander Werewolf.
Buffy Nowhere in any of the reports did it say anything about her being mauled. I mean, they were linked to the animal attacks from the other night, so we just assumed werewolf.
Xander What else should we have assumed?
Buffy Vampire.
Xander So that's good, right? I mean in the sense of the werewolf didn't get her, and... No. There is no good here.
Buffy No good. Instead of not protecting Theresa from the werewolf, I was able to not protect her from something just as bad. She had a lot of friends.
Xander Buffy, you can't blame yourself for every death that happens in Sunnydale. If it weren't for you people'd be lined up five deep waitin' to get themselves buried. Willow would be Robbie the Robot's love slave, I wouldn't even have a head, and Theresa's a vampire.
Theresa Angel sends his love.
Buffy Angel.
Xander Are you okay?
Buffy This isn't happening. He's gonna keep coming after me.
Xander Don't let him get to you. He's not the same guy you knew.
Xander Oh, no, my life's not too complicated.
Oz Willow! What are you doing?
Willow I had this whole thing worked out. And I had it written down, uh, but then it didn't make any sense when I was reading it back.
Oz Willow, this is not a very good time.
Willow I mean, what am I supposed to think? First, you buy me popcorn and then you're all glad that I didn't get bit. And you put the tag back in my shirt. But I guess none of that means anything because instead of looking up names with me, here you are all alone in your house doing nothing by yourself.
Oz Willow, we'll talk about this tomorrow. I promise.
Willow No, damn it! We'll talk about this now! Buffy told me that sometimes what a girl makes has to be the first move and now that I'm saying this, I'm starting to think that the written version sounded pretty good, but you know what I mean.
Oz I know, I know, it's me. I'm, I'm goin' through some... changes.
Willow Well, welcome to the world! Things happen. Don't you think I'm going through a lot?
Oz Not like me.
Willow Oh, what, so now you're special? You're special boy... With chains and stuff. Why do you have chains and stuff?
Oz Willow, please! Get outta here!
Willow Oz? Oz, what is it?
Willow What's wrong?
Cain There you are.
Buffy Sorry I'm late. I had to do some unscheduled slayage in the form of Theresa.
Giles She's a vampire?
Buffy Was. Angel sent her to me. A little token of his affection.
Giles Buffy, I'm so sorry.
Buffy Not now, Giles. We can all have ourselves a good cry after we bag us a werewolf.
Giles All set. Let's go find this thing.
Buffy One question: how exactly do we find this thing?
Willow It's Oz! It's Oz!
Buffy Wh-what's Oz?
Willow The werewolf.
Giles Are you certain?
Willow Can't you just trust me on this? He-he said he was going through all these changes. Then he went through all these... changes.
Buffy Where is he now?
Willow In the woods.
Giles Let's go.
Willow Go where? You're not gonna kill Oz! Yeah, he's a werewolf, but he doesn't mean to be.
Buffy Don't worry, Willow. We're not going to hurt him.
Giles I put enough Phenobarbital in this thing to sink a small elephant. It should be enough for a large werewolf.
Cain That's it. Let me see you. Come on, suppertime.
Cain Good, doggy. Now play dead.
Willow Careful!
Giles Damn it!
Willow I shot Oz.
Giles You saved us.
Cain No wonder this town's overrun with monsters. No one here's man enough to kill 'em.
Buffy Oh, I wouldn't be too sure of that.
Buffy How about you let the door hit you in the ass on the way out of town?
Willow You think it'll be okay?
Giles He'll be a little sore in the morning, but... he'll be Oz.
Xander This is all so weird. I mean, how are we supposed to act when we see him?
Buffy Well, it's gotta be weird for him, too. Now that we know so much.
Xander All I know is I'll never be able to look at him the same again.
Buffy He's still a human being. Most of the time.
Xander Who are we talking about?
Buffy Oz. Who are you talking about?
Xander No one.
Larry Hey, let me get those.
Girl Thanks.
Larry Hey! Xander. Look, about what you did. I, I owe you.
Buffy What'd you do?
Xander It's really nothing we should be talking about. Ever.
Larry I know, I know. It's just, well, thanks.
Buffy That was weird.
Xander What, it's not okay for one guy to like another guy just because he happened to be in the locker room with him when absolutely nothing happened and I thought I told you not to push.
Buffy All I meant is that he didn't try to look up my skirt.
Xander Oh, oh, yeah, that's, that's the weirdness.
Buffy Weirdness abounds lately. Maybe it's the moon. That does stuff to people.
Xander I've heard that.
Buffy Certainly gonna put a strain on Willow and Oz's relationship.
Xander What relationship? I mean, what life could they possibly have together? We're talking obedience school, paper training, Oz is always in back burying their things, and that kind of breed can turn on its owner.
Buffy I don't know. I kinda see Oz as the loyal type.
Xander All I'm saying is she's not safe with him. If it were up to me...
Buffy Xander...
Buffy It's not up to you.
Willow Hey.
Oz Hey.
Willow Did you want to go first?
Oz I spoke to Giles. He said I'll be okay. I just have to lock myself up around the full moon. Only he used more words than that. And a globe.
Willow I'm sorry about how all this ended up. With me shooting you and all.
Oz It's okay. I'm, I'm sorry I almost ate you.
Willow It's okay. I kind of thought you would have told me.
Oz I didn't know what to say. I mean, it's not everyday you find out you're a werewolf. That's fairly freaksome. It may take a couple days getting used to.
Willow Yeah. It's a complication.
Oz So... Maybe it'd be best if I just... sorta...
Willow What?
Oz Well, you know, like, stayed out of your way for awhile.
Willow I don't know. I'm kind of okay with you being *in* my way.
Oz You mean, you'd still...
Willow Well, I like you. You're nice and you're funny. And you don't smoke. Yeah, okay, werewolf, but that's not all the time. I mean, three days out of the month I'm not much fun to be around either.
Oz You are quite the human.
Willow So, I'd still if you'd still.
Oz I'd still. I'd *very* still.
Willow Okay. No biting, though.
Oz Agreed.
Oz A werewolf in love.

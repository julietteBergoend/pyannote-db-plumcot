buffy_summers Wow, this music is so... so...
kathy_newman I know. This song is super fun. Isn't it?
buffy_summers You bet. It just gets fun-er and fun-er every time youplayit.
kathy_newman Going out?
buffy_summers Yeah. I'm seriously caffeine deprived. Figure I'dhead down to The Grotto and get a jolt and, you know, do some studying.
kathy_newman Oh. It's late... won't you be up all night?
buffy_summers Oh, yeah, but it's cool. I'msort of an 'up' kind of night person. I mentioned that right?
kathy_newman I guess I just didn't realize you'd be coming and going at allhours. Well, not that I mind. I'm just surprised.
buffy_summers I'll be quiet as a mouse, I promise. Ok.
kathy_newman Oh! Say, Buffy. I wanted to show you this littlesystem I implemented.
buffy_summers Oh, goody... system.
kathy_newman Just log every call you make in here and that way when the billcomes it won't be a problem. I figure, 'Stitch in time...'
buffy_summers '...catches the worm.'
buffy_summers You bet. Ok, then.
kathy_newman Also... I noticed that some ofmy milk was missing. Did you...
buffy_summers Oh! Yeah, actually, I did. I meant to...
kathy_newman No! It's totally ok, I was just wondering.
buffy_summers Yeah, I-I-I was making my coffee and I just...
kathy_newman Buffy, it's fine. I just wanted to make sure...
kathy_newman ...that we didn't have a thief or something.
buffy_summers Like who? Sid the Wiley Dairy Gnome?
kathy_newman I don't know, it's no big deal. Please, feel free.
buffy_summers Ok, I'm really sorry. I have to...
kathy_newman Have a good time.
buffy_summers Yeah, you too. With ironing.
willow_rosenberg So you had trouble getting past Kathy?
buffy_summers Yep. She made big with the questions.
willow_rosenberg And you thought your days of sneaking out of your room wereover.
buffy_summers No such luck. Kathy's nice and all, but she's... she'ssort of... I don't know, like, 'mini-mom of Momdonia.' Did you just hear something?
willow_rosenberg I'm chewing my gum kinda loud.
buffy_summers That's not it.
willow_rosenberg My sneakers are squeaky.
buffy_summers I'm looking for something lurky here, Will.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Sorry, no.
buffy_summers Darn, I could use a little play tonight. Listening tothe best of VH-1 all day sort of put me on edge.
willow_rosenberg Oh, Kathy's still spinnin' the divas?
buffy_summers 'Cause it's the fun-est! Well,no big. College is a time of change, right? I bet, before toolong, she'll be trip-hoppin' all over the place.
willow_rosenberg Yeah! I mean, this whole dorm thing is just an adjustmentwe need to make. You know? I mean, my roomie is kind of challengingtoo.
buffy_summers And what are we if not women up to a challenge?
willow_rosenberg Exactly! I mean, did we not put the 'grr' in girl? Well, here's where I get off.
buffy_summers Say 'hey' to Oz for me.
willow_rosenberg Happy hunting.
buffy_summers Wish me monsters.
buffy_summers Will? Alright, why don't you quit hiding and come outand face me like a... thing.
kathy_newman Hey, I caught you.
buffy_summers Is everything ok?
kathy_newman Oh, everything's super. I just decided a decaf latte soundedlike heaven after all.
buffy_summers So you're coming along.
kathy_newman Why not? This way you won't have to walk these spookypaths alone.
buffy_summers Great! That's just great.
kathy_newman This is neat, isn't it? The fresh air, the trees, thesmell of...
kathy_newman What the blizzard was that all about?
buffy_summers Uh, he um... tried to take my backpack.
kathy_newman What were you thinking, taking him on like that?
buffy_summers Oh I, heh, I don't know, I guess I-I panicked.
kathy_newman I mean, it's just you could of gotten hurt or something. And look at my sweater, it's ruined!
buffy_summers Yeah, sorry about that. Here, w-we'll go get you cleanedup.
Demon1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode02 She may be the one.
Demon2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode02 We have to be sure. Follow her.
Demon1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode02 As you wish.
buffy_summers Boring... boring... bill... bill...
rupert_giles Hello.
buffy_summers You run?
rupert_giles And jump. And bend. And, occasionally, frolic.
buffy_summers Ok, and, uh, what's with the motorbikeand scooter magazine?
rupert_giles Congratulations, you've found me out. I'm a mod jogger.
buffy_summers Ok, you're not having one of those mid-life things, are you?'Cause I'm still going 'ick' from the last time you tried to recaptureyour youth.
rupert_giles Buffy!
buffy_summers Sorry. Demon. Last night. Made with the pummeling, but he got away.
rupert_giles What sort of demon?
buffy_summers Umm, had a cloak on, and glowing green eyes, and skin had a,like, super-bad fake rub-on tan.
rupert_giles Translate?
buffy_summers Orange-y?
rupert_giles Thank you. Anything else?
buffy_summers My roommate Kathy was there, but she didn't see anything.
rupert_giles You took your roommate patrolling with you?
buffy_summers Well I invited the whole dorm, but she was the only one thatcould make it. I told her I was going for coffee and she decided to tagalong.
rupert_giles Right. Well we should discourage her from that habit. From what you described I-I'm not familiar with the creature, but I-I'lllook into it and give you a ring when I've found something.
buffy_summers You know, it's nice out here.
rupert_giles Yes, I take my tea out here sometimes.
buffy_summers What are you doing today?
rupert_giles Uh, it's a good day for me, actually.A friend of mine recently acquired a-uh an original Gutenberg demonography...and it suddenly occurred to me that you've never once asked me what myday's plans were, which leads me to inquire whether you're feeling entirelyyourself.
buffy_summers That's not true. I ask about you all the time. Ok, well, maybe the words don't actually make it out of mymouth, but I think about it.
rupert_giles And it's appreciated. Which doesn't explain why you'rehanging around here instead of rushing off as usual.
buffy_summers It's no big. I just figured I'd hang hereyou know—untilmy roommate goes to class.
rupert_giles Ah, I see.
buffy_summers I know, it's probably just me having a bitch attack. Butit's not... me.
rupert_giles Buffy, living with somebody is never easy. Especiallyfor an only child...
buffy_summers Giles, listen to me, ok? When she sharpens her pencilsshe measures them with a ruler to make sure they're all the same size.
rupert_giles Which is fussy, I agree, but everybody has their idiosyncrasies. You'd do well to learn to tolerate them.
buffy_summers Or I'll end up an old lady who can only live with cats?
rupert_giles Something like that. Buffy: Ok. You know what? You'reright. Take a mental pic, this is the new Buffy. Kinder, gentler... roommate extraordinaire.
parker_abrams Ex-boyfriend? Or loan shark?
buffy_summers Excuse me?
parker_abrams The person you're hiding from.
buffy_summers Oh... both. Ugly breakup. I'm sorry, I just cutyou...
parker_abrams No, stay... stay. I'll watch your back. Freshman, huh?
buffy_summers Is it that obvious?
parker_abrams There are signs. For instance, peoplewho've been around for awhile know how to use their dining hall card.
buffy_summers It's not for food?
parker_abrams Work it right and you can get three meals worth, which equalsfewer punch cards used annually.
buffy_summers And more cash from dad which you get to keep for yourself.
parker_abrams Right! The goal is to polish off as much as humanly possibleat one sitting. Enough to get you through the rest of the day, ifnecessary. While chipmunking items for future consumption.
buffy_summers Ahh, got it.
parker_abrams Excess dry goods fit nicely in a backpack or your pocket. The wetter itemsmacaronies,your turkey loafthen you're into ziplocks. It's not for beginners.
buffy_summers I'll just take it slow.
parker_abrams So.
buffy_summers So, those are my... are you...
parker_abrams Oh, no, I have someone waiting. Otherwise I'd... heh,uh, Parker Abrams. I'm at Kresgehall.
buffy_summers Buffy Summers, Stevenson.
parker_abrams Ok, well, I'll see you around Buffy Summers of Stevenson.
buffy_summers See ya, Parker Abrams.
xander_harris Hey, say hi to non-college guy.
buffy_summers Not that I mind, but don't non-college guys usually populatethe non-campus?
xander_harris Usually. I just thought I'd come around and check onmy girls.
willow_rosenberg And eat off my plate.
buffy_summers What's the deal Xand, parents not feeding you?
xander_harris Sure they do, for a price.
willow_rosenberg So, spill!What was that all about, with the cutie patootie?
buffy_summers I don't know... nothing big, I think. Just random adorableness.
xander_harris Oh, a technique I know well. Hit the girl with your bestshot, then hasta.
oz Gotta respect the drive-by.
xander_harris Low rejection, fond memories.
willow_rosenberg It looked like more than that to me. He got all googly-eyed.
xander_harris That's because he got hit by the Buffinator. Now he'spowerless.
buffy_summers You think?
oz No question, he'll be back.
xander_harris So, what else is up with the Buff, any vamp action?
buffy_summers I did get jumped by a demon of non-specific origin last night.
xander_harris Yeah? Something apocalypse-y? Do we need to assemblethe scooby gang?
buffy_summers No, but thank you for asking.
xander_harris I just got way too excited, didn't I?
buffy_summers You just need to get out of the basement a little more there,Xand.
kathy_newman Hi, everybody. Squeeze in.
buffy_summers You all know my roomie, Kathy?
willow_rosenberg Hi.
oz Hey, Kath.
buffy_summers Is that my sweater?
kathy_newman I didn't think you'd mind, I mean you got mine all muddy.
buffy_summers I was saving you from a...
willow_rosenberg Bear!
buffy_summers Mugger.
kathy_newman It's not a problem, is it? I mean, I figured we're almostlike sisters now, living together and everything.
buffy_summers No, it's... it's fine. I just wished you'd asked.
xander_harris So, where're you from, Kathy?
kathy_newman Nebraska, originally.
xander_harris Ahh, yes. Big sky country.
buffy_summers I mean, can you believe her? First she acts like she hassit privileges at my lunch table just because some computer had to makeus cellmates.
willow_rosenberg I'm sure it's not easy for her. She's not like you, shedoesn't know anybody here.
buffy_summers Fine. But what about my sweater. You can't believethe stuff that I have to put up with.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I guess it's hard... uh... but I'm sure the sweater thingwas an accident.
buffy_summers I don't know Will... I think she's just coming back from thebathroom. I'll call you back.
kathy_newman Don't forget to log those calls.
kathy_newman Ewww! Who left their gum here?
buffy_summers Gum gnome?
kathy_newman It wasn't me! It had to be somebody, Buffy!
buffy_summers I don't know.
kathy_newman Do you always make that noise when you sleep?
buffy_summers So then after the scorpion, the demon opened my mouth and suckedsome kind of weird light out of me. A-and the worst part? Iwake up and there's Kathy, staring at me like I'm some kind of freak.
oz Well, actually, the worst part, I'd have to go with the demon poringthe blood down your throat.
willow_rosenberg Me too, I would vote for that too.
buffy_summers But that's just a dream, and this Kathy thing is real. All she cared about was that her precious sleep had been disturbed.
rupert_giles Perhaps it would be more productive to examine your dreams,um, determine there meaning.
kathy_newman You can read dreams? Neat.
buffy_summers Giles, Kathy. Kathy, Giles.
willow_rosenberg He's our grown-up friend. N-not in a creepy way.
rupert_giles Nice to meet you, Kathy.
kathy_newman Ditto. Maybe you could read the dream I had last night?There was, like, this monster, and he sat on me and did all this stuffto me.
oz Stuff like, scorpions? And Bloody Mary minus the Mary?
kathy_newman That's it! How'd you know?
oz Well, I'm a good guesser.
buffy_summers Me too, and I'm guessing that you need to be on your way toclass. Right, Kath?
kathy_newman Hmm hmm, sounds like somebody woke up on the wrong side of thebed this morning.
buffy_summers Hmm hmm, and guess what? You were next to it.
kathy_newman You know, I do need to dash. My whole schedule is offbecause someone kept me up all night. Well, it's been fun. Toodles.
buffy_summers Toodles.
rupert_giles You know what this means...
buffy_summers Yes. Not only does she take my sweater, but now she hasto horn in on my dreams. She is the most ever mooch... Oh,I haven't even gotten to the floss.
rupert_giles Buffy, focus, please? If Kathy and you are having thesame nightmares, chances are something happened to you both when you metthe demon in the woods.
willow_rosenberg So we need to figure out if this ritual their dreaming abouthas some special use, or meaning.
buffy_summers Cool, you guys can dothe brain thing. I'm gonna go to class.
oz Which could also be construed as the brain thing.
buffy_summers Not when you're minoring in 'Napping 101.'
willow_rosenberg Ok, so that was the evil twin, right? 'Cause she wasbordering on Cordelia-esque.
oz Well, she's definitely pushing the stress meter on this Kathy thing.
rupert_giles I concur she's not, uh, herself, but, you know, uh, learningto live with someone can be a challenge.
willow_rosenberg A-and she hasn't been sleeping.
rupert_giles Right, then. Nothing to get to concerned about.Still, let me know if she, um...
oz Hits the red zone?
rupert_giles Yes.
Demon1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode02 We were correct. She is the one.
Demon2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode02 Good. I have prepared for the summoning of the greatone, Taparrich.
parker_abrams Lots of popular artists don't get their dues. Madonna?Whitney?
kathy_newman That's so totally true.
buffy_summers Parker?
parker_abrams Hey, uh, I just droppedby to say... that. Uh, and bring you... You know, to maximize your dining hall exports. They'reheavy duty.
buffy_summers Plus freezer guard! That's so...
kathy_newman Parker was just going to leave his number and go, butwe started talking. He's such a blast, and time just flew.
buffy_summers Time, really? How much time?
parker_abrams Uh, I'm not sure, we sort of got caught up talking Red Wings.It turns out that Kathy's a closet hockey fan. I think it's the violence.
kathy_newman Quit it! I told you that was just between us.
parker_abrams It could be the sweaty men.
buffy_summers If you two are going to rassle, do you mind taking it outside?I've got a lot of work to do.
parker_abrams Sorry, I didn't realize.
buffy_summers Oh, Parker wait. Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
parker_abrams No, it's totally cool. I should go anyway.
buffy_summers Well, it was great of you to stop by, m-maybe we could do itanother time?
parker_abrams Another time for sure. Bye, Kathy.
kathy_newman Bye, seeya.
kathy_newman It wouldn't have killed you to be nice, you know.
buffy_summers Looked like you were being nice enough for the both of us.
kathy_newman I wasn't moving in on your territory,if that's what you mean.
buffy_summers Right. Justlike you didn't destroy my sweater.
kathy_newman I'm cold.
buffy_summers Well I'm hot. Deal with it.
kathy_newman Do you know what your problem is, Buffy.
buffy_summers You?
kathy_newman Hardly. Your problem is you're spoiled. Maybe theworld revolved around you where you used to live, but it's share time now.
buffy_summers Share time, huh? Fine! I'll show you share time.
oz You're worried about her.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, both of them. I mean, what kind of demon runs aroundputting ookie blood dreams into people's heads. Like some kind ofnightmare fairy. It's not right.
oz Well, I'm against it.
willow_rosenberg And Buffy's completely being not herself. If it wasn'tfor this English paper I'd be there right now. Um, listening. Doing the girly best friend thing.
oz Well, I can do that.
willow_rosenberg You can?
oz Well, I'm not saying we'll braid each others hairprobably—butI can hang with her, watch for signs she's going over the edge.
willow_rosenberg You're the best. Oh, she's probably patrolling by now.Check around the science center. If you need me I'll be at thelibrary.
buffy_summers ...so then Kathy's like, 'It's share time.' And I'm like,'Oh yeah? Share this!'
oz So, either you hit her, or you did your wacky mime routine forher.
buffy_summers Well, I didn't do either, actually. But she deserves it,don't you think?
oz Nobody deserves a mime, Buffy.
buffy_summers Hmm, Kathy does. She deserves to be locked in an invisiblebox and blown away by an imaginary wind and... and...
oz Forced to wear a binding unitard?
buffy_summers Yeah, the itchy kind, it's perfect.
oz Just here to help.
buffy_summers Which I appreciate. But you've never come on routine patrolwith me before, Oz. So, what's the deal?
oz Seemed more interesting than homework.
buffy_summers As long as it's an elective. I can handle myself alone,you know.
oz Not in question.
buffy_summers Good. So then, I go into the refrigeratorright?andthe label queen has managed to put...
oz Just a, just a thought, Buffy, but do you think all this rantingis scaring away potential demons?
buffy_summers You're right. Ooh! She's even affecting my work,now. She's the Titanic. She's a crawling black cancer.She's... other really bad things.
oz On the plus side you've killed the bench, which was looking shifty.
buffy_summers This isn't funny, Oz. Something has to be done.
oz Agreed.
buffy_summers I'm going to bed.
kathy_newman Oh, jeez.
kathy_newman I do what I can, but Buffy's difficult. She's secretive,for one thing, she comes in at all hours of the night, she leaves her gumall over the place.
willow_rosenberg I-it sounds like things are rough, but don't you want to betalking to Buffy about this?
kathy_newman I would, but she is so touchy about all kinds of weird stuff.I mean sometimes I get the feeling that she is not quite normal. You know?
willow_rosenberg Well, normal is relative. Right?
kathy_newman Later, ok?
buffy_summers Why were you talking to her?
willow_rosenberg Buffy, come on, we were only just saying hi.
kathy_newman Yeah, that's what she wants you to think.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, this has to stop. I mean I-I get it, I have asucky roomie, too. But you just have to deal.
buffy_summers You're right, I've been thinking a lot about this and it's clearto me now.
willow_rosenberg Good, that's better.
buffy_summers Kathy's evil. I'm an evil fighter. It's simple...I'm gonna have to kill her.
willow_rosenberg You have to kill her? Don't you think you could just switchrooms, or something?
buffy_summers Well I would, but it's not just me in danger from Kathy. Look.
willow_rosenberg Toenails?
buffy_summers Evil toenails. I took them off the floor last night whenshe was in the bathroom. She thought I was asleep.
willow_rosenberg Good thinking, 'cause in the middle of the night those toenailscould have attacked you and left little half-moon marks all over your body.
buffy_summers Don't be ridiculous. The point is I measured them beforeI fell asleep and again this morning, and they grew. After they werecut! That's a demon thing, she has to be eliminated.
willow_rosenberg Of course. I-it makes sense, now. But you bettershow those bad puppies to Giles before you do anything just to be sure.
buffy_summers Absolutely. I don't want to do anything crazy.
willow_rosenberg Uh, you hurry on to Giles. I'll hang here and-and keepan eye on Kathy.
buffy_summers Great. Good. Thanks, Will.
willow_rosenberg Giles, I-I just talked to Buffy and, yeah, I think she's feelinga little... insane. No, n-not bitchy crazy, more like homicidal maniaccrazy. So I told her to come to you. Kay?
buffy_summers Giles? Anybody home? Hello?
buffy_summers What are you guys doing? This is... this is ridiculous.
xander_harris Buffy, this hurts me more than it hurts you.
buffy_summers Not yet, but it will.
xander_harris Don't say that.Oh, PLEASE don't say that.
rupert_giles We're doing this to stop you from making a terrible mistake.
rupert_giles Clearly something is amiss.
buffy_summers Yeah, something's amiss here, a 'Miss Kathy Newman.' Giles,ow, Giles look in my bag. Look in the bottompocket of my bag. She has parts that can grow afterthey're detached. She irons her jeans. She's evil. She has to be destroyed.
rupert_giles I fear the demon that Buffy met inthe woods has somehow possessed her.
buffy_summers Lite FM. Love songs. Nothing but love songs.
xander_harris You think?
rupert_giles Um, you stay and watch her. I-I know a spell that willmake the possessing demon reveal itself so that we can fight it, but I-Ineed to get some supplies from the magic shop. Buffy, I... See youaround.
willow_rosenberg Can I come in?
kathy_newman Sure. Where's Buffy?
willow_rosenberg I don't know, exactly. But I've been thinking, it mightbe a good idea for you and Buffy to give each other some apart time. In fact, you might want to be, uh, apart before she gets back.
kathy_newman What do you mean? I should leave the room? Why shouldI go?
willow_rosenberg I-it's not fair, I know.
kathy_newman You bet it's not fair, having to live with someone who's obviouslytroubled. Someone who so clearly needs to be in a home, not in adorm.
willow_rosenberg I don't know about that. Uh, Buffy's going through something,yes, but...
kathy_newman I wouldn't put it past her to drop out, or take off or something. Do something horrible to herself.
willow_rosenberg Herself?
kathy_newman Or worse. She's capable of it, you know? You cansee it in those shifty little eyes of hers. One of these days shemight even push somebody too far.
kathy_newman Hello? It's Oz.
willow_rosenberg Hi. You did? She's at Giles, uh, ok. You know, during that reallyshort phone call I realized you are so right. I mean, it's not fairto make you leave your own room. So, you're good. You juststay, right there. Kay?
buffy_summers I can't believe this, after all that we've been through togetherand you guys won't believe me when I tell you that Kathy is bad.
xander_harris We want to, Buff, it's just...
oz Shh, don't engage.
xander_harris I don't know if I tightened those ropes enough.
oz Then we'd better go over there and check 'em.
xander_harris Oh, dear god!
xander_harris Avoid the legs. Avoid the legs.
buffy_summers Nope, not tight enough.
buffy_summers Kathy.
kathy_newman Buffy.
buffy_summers I think we need to talk, don't you?
kathy_newman Absolutely. Let's talk.
buffy_summers Oops, look what I did.
kathy_newman Huh, look what I did.
buffy_summers I knew it!
Taparrich#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode02 Where is she?
kathy_newman Quit it!
buffy_summers I knew it! I knew you were one of those demon things.
kathy_newman Oh why don't you just stuff it and let me finish my ritual.
buffy_summers Ritual?
rupert_giles 'The ritual of Mok'tagar, a race of trans-dimensional demons,involves the forced ingestion of animal blood while the victim slumbers.' Buffy's nightmares...
buffy_summers ...were real.
kathy_newman I'm sorry, ok? I left my dimension to go to college andthey sent these guys after me.
rupert_giles 'But while the Mok'tagar can assume many forms and guises, includinghuman, they can always be recognized by others of their kind due to thelack of a soul.'
kathy_newman ...so I'm borrowing yours.
buffy_summers Without even asking.
kathy_newman Tonight, when they come looking for me, they'll take the onewithout a soul.
buffy_summers Well, thank God I won't have to watch you floss anymore.
kathy_newman And I won't have to live with a slob.
kathy_newman It's share time, Buffy.
buffy_summers Fine, let's start with my sweater.
buffy_summers Oh!
xander_harris Oow... why couldn't Giles have shackles like any self respectingbachelor?
willow_rosenberg Guys, I just saw Kathy and she's acting... Oh my God, are youok?
oz Yeah, Buffy's got a pretty good lead on us, though.
willow_rosenberg I-I'll call Kathy, tell her to get out of there.
kathy_newman All you had to do was write down calls!
willow_rosenberg No answer.
rupert_giles Toenails! Buffy was right. Kathy's toenails notonly keep growing after they've been cut, they actually regenerate afterthey've been destroyed.
willow_rosenberg And that's a demon thing?
rupert_giles Oh, unequivocally yes. So... where is Buffy? Oh dear, we have even less time than I feared. I've looked upall known regenerating demons. Only one species practices the ritualBuffy's been seeing in her sleep. It's used to steal the soul froma human body.
xander_harris W-wait, are you saying that Buffy's been doing a Linda Blairon us because Kathy's been sucking her soul?
rupert_giles I believe so, yes. Excuse me please.
willow_rosenberg So Buffy was right all along. Later on, big remorse.
rupert_giles Now, I've found a spell that should reverse the soul transferprocedure immediately. Willow and Iwill perform it at once.
oz Leaving Xander and me to help Buffy in the flesh.
rupert_giles 'Hear me, elders of the upper reaches... elders of the lowerreaches... elders of the dry land... elders of the river flats.'
buffy_summers Ah-hah!
Student#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode02 Do you mind? People are trying to study!
rupert_giles 'Ancients I beseech you. The soul, abstracted. Letit revert to it's true seat.'
kathy_newman The window's open. Happy?
kathy_newman Open up! Let me finish!
rupert_giles 'Let it be finished. Let the unnatural vessel be emptied,let the essence be returned to it's original host.'
kathy_newman How did you do...
Taparrich#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode02 There you are. Do you have any idea how much troubleyou're in young lady?
kathy_newman I'm not going back!
Taparrich#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode02 Don't take that tone with me.
kathy_newman I'm 3000 years old! When are you going to stop treatingme like I'm 900?
Taparrich#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode02 Enough. You're coming home.
willow_rosenberg How's that?
buffy_summers Uh-uh, a little to the left... there. Perfect. I'mso glad you're here Will. I can already feel all that bad-Kathy-karma just draining away.
willow_rosenberg About thatThe Kathy thing?I'm sorry I doubted you.

Ben Hey.
Ben I'm Ben. We had Algebra II together last year.
Buffy Sorry, I pretty much repress anything math-related.
Ben Ms. Jackson? Second period? You sat in the seat three over and one behind.
Buffy Oh! Yeah, I remember now, it's the one with the desks and the chalkboards and pencils and stuff, right?
Ben That's the one.
Buffy Like a steel trap.
Ben So, I was wondering, you know the dance tomorrow night? Are you going?
Buffy You mean the Sadie Hawkins thing? The deal where the girls ask the boys?
Ben Yeah.
Ben And I thought maybe, you know, if you're free, you might ask me.
Buffy Oh, gosh... I...
Ben Oh, oh, hey, hey, no, don't, don't worry about it...
Buffy No, no, you seem like a really great guy, it's...
Buffy ...me. I-I'm not seeing anybody.
Buffy Ever again, actually.
Ben Oh. That's, that's too bad.
Ben Okay, well, I better...
Buffy Sorry.
Willow Hey! You're bailing?
Buffy Yeah. I'm gonna stop by the library and see if Giles wants me to patrol, and then sack it.
Willow You've been doing that a lot. Patrolling and sacking. In fact, you've kind of been All-Work-And-No-Play Buffy.
Buffy I play. I have *big* fun. I came here tonight, didn't I?
Willow You came, you saw, you rejected.
Buffy You mean that guy? Just not in date mode right now.
Willow Well, maybe you need to date to get in date mode.
Buffy I don't think I'm ready for that, Will.
Willow You're thinking too much. Maybe you need to be impulsive.
Buffy Impulsive? Do you remember my ex-boyfriend, the vampire? I slept with him, he lost his soul, now my boyfriend's gone forever, and the demon that wears his face is killing my friends. The next impulsive decision I make will involve my choice of dentures.
Willow Okay, the Angel thing went badly, I'm on board with that, but that's not your fault. And anyways, love isn't always like that. Love can be... nice!
Boy Come back here! We're not finished!
Boy You don't care anymore, is that it?
Girl No, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what I feel.
Boy Then tell me you don't love me. Say it!
Girl Will that help? Is that what you need to hear? I don't. I don't! Now let me go.
Boy No! A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving somebody.
Boy Love is forever.
Boy I'm not afraid to use it. I swear! If I can't be with you...
Buffy Hey!
Girl Oh, my God!
Boy DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME, BITCH!
Boy What happened?
Buffy What happened?! You just went O.J. on your girlfriend!
Boy This is nuts! I... I don't know why I got so mad.
Buffy Because you're a jerk?
Girl He's not. We weren't even fighting a few minutes ago.
Boy We weren't, I, I swear to God!
Buffy If you weren't fighting, then why'd you have a gun?
Boy I don't, I don't know. I don't even know where I got it.
George I don't see any gun.
Snyder I'm sure you know why I asked you here.
Buffy To thank me?
Snyder That's right, I wanna thank you. What would Sunnydale High do without you around to incite mayhem, chaos and disorder?
Buffy I don't incite! I stopped that boy from killing his girlfriend, ask him. Ask the janitor.
Snyder People can be coerced, Summers. I'm no stranger to conspiracy. I saw JFK. I'm a truth seeker. I've got a missing gun and two confused kids on my hands. Pieces of the puzzle. And I'm gonna look at all the pieces carefully and rationally, and I'm gonna keep looking until I know exactly how this is all your fault.
Secretary Mr. Snyder, Billy Crandal chained himself to the snack machine again.
Snyder Pathetic little no-life vegan.
Snyder Not so fast, missy. I'm not done with you yet. You stink of lies.
Willow So, for next time read the chapters on information grouping and binary coding.
Willow I bet you'll think coding is pretty cool. I mean, if you find two-digit, multi-stacked conversions and primary number clusters a big hoot.
Willow Giles! I made them laugh, did you hear? I did the joke thing!
Giles Yes, yes, so it seems. I-I mean, um, uh, you did indeed. Good, good, good show. I-I-I just stopped by to, to see if you needed any assistance, but you seem to have things quite under control.
Willow Well, I had good lesson plans. Ms. Calendar had them on her computer.
Giles Yes, yes, she was very, um... uh, dedicated.
Willow And I found a bunch of files and Internet sites on paganism and magic and stuff.
Giles Oh?
Willow Yes, it's really interesting.
Willow And, uh, I found this in her drawer. She told me it was a rose quartz. And it has healing powers.
Willow I thought she'd want you to have it.
Giles Oh, thank you, Willow, that's, um... that's very thoughtful of you.
Teacher Before 1935, the new deal focused on revitalizing stricken business and agricultural communities. And the new deal also tried to regulate the nation's financial hierarchy to avoid another disaster like the 1929 stock market crash.
Ms._Newman Don't forget, your assignments are due on Friday, class.
Girl#1 I told Ms. Hall we'd go help decorate the gym. Who are you taking?
Girl#2 David said yes.
Girl#1 Oh, you're kidding! He's so dreamy!
Ms._Newman Thank you.
Ms._Newman Thank you, James. How are you enjoying that book I loaned you? The Hemingway.
James I like it. Very much. It's honest.
Ms._Newman Yes, it's, um... it's based on a true story, actually. He fell in love with his...
Teacher ...hours, child labor...
Teacher ...and collective bargaining.
Teacher Oh, my God!
Boy Did you see what he wrote?
Buffy I'm telling you, something weird is going on.
Xander Something weird is going on. Isn't that our school motto?
Buffy Pretty much. But I don't know. This time it bugs me.
Xander I don't wanna poo-poo your wiggins, but a domestic dispute, a little case of chalkboard Tourette's? All sounds like Hellmouth Lite to me.
Willow Xander, what happened? Did Cordelia win another round in the broom closet?
Xander You're just a big bucket of funny, Will.
Xander I'll have you know I was just accosted by some kind of, um, locker monster.
Giles Loch Ness Monster?
Buffy 'Locker' monster is what he said. But it wasn't really a monster. It was, like, this big arm that came out of the locker, but then we opened it again, it was gone. Nothing.
Xander This was right after Buffy's history teacher starts doing some freaky channeling thing in class.
Giles Ooh! Sounds like paranormal phenomena.
Willow A ghost? Cool!
Xander Oh, no, no. No. No cool. This was no wimpy chain rattler. This was 'I'm dead as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore.'
Giles Well, despite the Xander-speak, that's a fairly accurate definition of a poltergeist.
Xander I defined something? Accurately? Guess I'm done with the book learning.
Buffy So we have some bad boo on our hands?
Giles Yes.
Willow Well, why is it here? Does it just wanna scare people?
Giles Unfortunately, he doesn't know exactly what he wants. That's, that's the trouble. See, uh, many times the spirit is plagued by all manner of worldly troubles. Being dead, it has no way to, uh, to make its peace. So it, it lashes out, growing ever more confused, ever more angry.
Buffy So it's a normal teenager, only dead.
Willow Well, what can we do? Is there any way to stop it?
Giles Uh, the only tried and true way is to work out what unresolved issues keep it here, and-and-and, um, resolve them.
Buffy Fabulous. Now we're Dr. Laura for the deceased.
Giles Only if we can find out who this spirit is. Or was.
George Working late Ms. Frank?
Ms._Frank My fault. Let myself get behind. Is it okay to walk here George? It is George, right?
George Oh, yes ma'am. You go ahead.
Ms._Frank Thanks. You have a nice evening.
George You too. Drive safe. Oh, Ms. Frank?
Ms._Frank Yes?
George You can't make me disappear just because you say it's over.
Ms._Frank There's no way we can be together. No way people will ever understand. Accept it.
George Is that what this is about? What other people think?
Ms._Frank No! I just want you to be able to have some kind of a normal life. We can never have that. Don't you see?
George I don't give a damn about a normal life! I'm going crazy not seeing you. I think about you every minute.
Ms._Frank I know. But it's over. It has to be.
George Come back here! We're not finished yet!
George You don't care anymore? Is that it?
Ms._Frank It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what I feel.
George Then tell me you don't love me. Say it!
Ms._Frank Will that help? Is that what you have to hear? I don't. I don't. Now let me go.
George No. A person doesn't just wake up one day and stop loving somebody.
George Love is forever.
George I'm not afraid to use it. I swear. If I can't be with you...
Ms._Frank Oh, my God.
George DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME, BITCH!
Voice I need you.
Giles Jenny.
George Don't!
George Don't do that, damn it! Don't talk to me like I'm some dumb...
George What's going on?
Giles What's going on? You just shot a woman.
Angelus And this... this is the garden.
Drusilla Wow! Look. Jasmine.
Angelus Night blooming.
Drusilla Like us. Oh, Angel, it's fairyland. Ooh!
Spike It's paradise. Big windows, lovely gardens. It'll be perfect when we want the sunlight to kill us.
Angelus If you don't like it, Spike, hit the stairs and go. Take a stand, man.
Spike Well, our old place was just fine till you went and had it burned down.
Angelus Things change, Spikey. You gotta roll with the punches. Well, actually, you pretty much got that part down, haven't you?
Spike Very funny, mate.
Angelus What can I say? I just love to see you smile, buddy.
Spike Yeah, you're a giver.
Giles It was just as with the, the couple you encountered the other night, Buffy. The, the janitor remembered everything. He, he knew he'd killed this poor woman, but he had no idea why. Well, they-they had no intimate relationship.
Willow What about the gun? Did you find it?
Giles No, no. The police, everybody, we-we-we-we searched high and low. I think it's very clear what's happening here.
Xander Fill me in then, 'cause I've read the book, seen the movie, and I'm still fuzzy about what's going on.
Giles It's Jenny.
Buffy What?
Xander You think she's the ghost?
Giles Well, don't you see? Well, she-she-she died here under tragic circumstances, a-a-and now she's trapped.
Willow But what about the gun? I mean, Angel didn't shoot Ms. Calendar.
Giles The gun is insignificant. It's the violence of the thing that matters.
Buffy I don't know. These fights these couples keep having, it's sort of... specific.
Willow She's right. It's a pattern that doesn't fit with the way Ms. Calendar died.
Giles Yes, well, I, uh, I appreciate your thoughts on the matter, I, in fact I... well, I *encourage* you to, to always, uh, challenge me, uh, when you feel it's appropriate. You should never be cowed by authority. Except, of course, in this instance, when I am clearly right and you are clearly wrong.
Willow This is freaky. I don't ever remember ever seeing Giles be this weird.
Xander I know. He's usually Investigate-Things-From-Every-Boring-Angle Guy. Now he's I-Cling-Onto-My-One-Lame-Idea Guy. What gives?
Buffy He misses her. He can't think. Just a little more fallout from my love life.
Willow Okay, but this ghost stuff is something else. Let me do a crosscheck on other shootings at the school.
Buffy Yeah, we need some alternate ghost theories. What do we know?
Xander Dog spit is cleaner than human.
Buffy Besides that?
Willow Oh, boy, we know plenty.
Willow It says a student murdered a teacher on the night of the Sadie Hawkins Dance. The rumor was they were having an affair, and she tried to break it off. After he killed her, he went into the music room and shot himself.
Xander Ladies and gentlemen, we have a ghost. It is one of those two, right?
Willow It all fits: the gun, the Sadie Hawkins Dance.
Buffy Which is tonight.
Xander How come we've never heard about this murder-suicide thing before? When did it happen?
Buffy 1955.
Willow How did you know?
Buffy Okay, here's the new strangeness. I dreamt about this woman, Grace Newman, the other day. Her and this guy.
Willow Jim Stanley? He's the one. He did it.
Xander Your dreams are getting wicked accurate, Buff. You wouldn't happen to see me coming across some big cash? Or possibly knowing the love of a woman? In a full body sense?
Buffy He couldn't make her love him, so he killed her. Sicko.
Willow He looks so normal on this picture. He was smart, too. He made the honor roll.
Buffy Smart.
Xander He killed a person and killed himself. Those are pretty much two of the dumbest things you could do.
Willow I know, but... Well, don't you feel kind of bad for them?
Buffy Sure I feel lousy. For her. He's a murderer and he should pay for it.
Willow With his life?
Buffy No, he should be doing sixty years in a prison, breaking rocks and making special friends with Roscoe the Weightlifter.
Xander Yikes. The quality of mercy is not Buffy.
Willow Whose ghost do you think we're dealing with? His or hers?
Buffy Well, considering how violent it is, I'm gonna say his.
Xander That tracks.
Willow Well, I've been browsing on some of Ms. Calendar's pagan sites. Maybe I can find a way to communicate with them and... we can find out what he wants.
Buffy Who cares what he wants? We need to shut him down before some other innocent guy goes and kills some poor nice girl and then blows his brains out all over the music room wall.
Xander Okay! Who's hungry?
Cordelia I hope you guys aren't going to the Sadie Hawkins Dance tonight, 'cause I'm organizing a boycott. Do you realize that the girls have to ask the guys? And pay and everything? I mean, whose genius idea was that?
Xander Obviously, some hairy-legged feminist.
Cordelia Really! Well, we need to nip this thing in the bud. I mean, otherwise, things are going to get really scary.
Cordelia Perfect. I'm gonna be scarred and swollen. Why didn't they just kill me?
Chief Schoolboy pranks?
Snyder Never sell.
Chief The sewer got backed up.
Snyder Better. I can probably make that one fly. But this is getting out of hand. People will talk.
Chief You'll take care of it.
Snyder I'm doing everything I can, but you people have to realize...
Man Snyder, what's going on here?
Snyder Backed up sewer line. Same thing happened in San Diego just last week.
Snyder We're on a Hellmouth. Sooner or later, people are gonna figure that out.
Chief The city council was told that you could handle this job. If you feel that you can't, perhaps you'd like to take that up... with the Mayor.
Snyder I'll handle it. I will.
Willow Remember the plan to contact the spirit and talk to it? Scrap that plan. Buffy, you were right. The time for touchy-feely communication is passed. I've done some homework and found the only solution is the final solution.
Xander Nuke the school? I like that.
Willow Not quite. Exorcism.
Cordelia Are you crazy? I saw that movie! Even the priest died.
Buffy What's the deal?
Willow Okay, see here, the balcony? That's where the original teacher died back in 1955 and that teacher last night. That's the hot spot where all the bad mojo is coming from. We need to create a Mangus-tripod.
Cordelia A what?
Willow One person chants here on the hot spot. And the other three chant in other places around the school forming a triangle. It's supposed to bind the bad spirit and keep it from doing any more harm.
Buffy Well, I'll take the hot spot. If there's trouble, that's where it'll be.
Xander This ghost, this James guy, is fixating on you, Buffy. The dreams, the yearbook... You sure you can handle it?
Buffy Well, I'm hoping he'll show. I truly am.
Buffy Okay, we all have our places. We do the chant and light the candle at midnight exactly. Any questions?
Cordelia Yeah, what if this mangled triangle thingy doesn't work?
Willow Oh! I almost forgot. I made us all scapulas.
Xander Okay, so we can flip the ghost over when it turns a nice golden brown?
Willow Scapula, not spatula. Um, you wear it around your neck for protection.
Cordelia You expect me to wear this? It smells like grandpa breath.
Willow Sorry, I didn't have a lot of time. I had to use sulfur. Stinky, but effective.
Buffy Okay, let's do this.
Cordelia No problem. This will be a piece of cake. Right?
Drusilla Maybe I'll sleep underground. Dig myself a little burrow.
Spike What about your pretty dress, sweet? It'll get all dirty.
Drusilla Then I'll sleep naked. Like the animals do.
Angelus You know, I'm suddenly liking this plan.
Spike Fortunately, nobody cares what you like, mate.
Angelus Oh, yeah? Let's ask Dru.
Drusilla There's a gate! It's opening!
Angelus Incoming! I love when she does this.
Spike What gate, pet? What do you see?
Drusilla It's black. It wants her.
Angelus Wants who?
Drusilla The Slayer. It's time, Angel. She's ready for you now. She's dancing. Dancing with death.
Spike Big deal. He won't do anything. Our man Angel here likes to talk but he's not much for action. All hat and no cattle.
Angelus I don't know about that. I think this whole Slayer thing has run its course. I'm ready to focus my energy elsewhere.
Spike Really?
Angelus Oh, yeah! What, with you being Special Needs Boy, I figure I should stick close to home. You and Dru can always use another pair of hands.
Giles God, Willow, what are you doing here? You're not supposed to be inside.
Willow Me? What about you?
Giles I'm, uh, I'm, I'm trying to, uh... I think I-I may be close to, uh, contacting Jenny.
Giles What's that smell?
Willow It's my scapula.
Giles Ah, right, of course. Did you use sulfur?
Willow Yeah.
Giles That's clever. Uh, well, uh, run along then. Th-there may be some, uh, paranormal ph-phenomena if I contact her. Y-y-you don't want to be in the line of fire.
Willow Okay. 'Night.
Xander Oh, yeah, baby, it's snakalicious in here.
Willow GILES!
Giles WILLOW!
Willow GILES! GILES!
Giles WHERE ARE YOU?!
Willow PLEASE! HELP! HELP ME!
Willow HELP! HELP! HELP! HELP!
James Stop!
Ms._Newman Just calm down.
James Get out!
Giles Are you all right?
Willow Giles, Jenny could never be this mean.
Giles I know. It's, it's not her, is it?
Willow I'm sorry.
Willow Oh, God. Oh.
Giles Careful up here!
Willow I shall confront and expel all evil.
Cordelia I shall *totally* confront and expel all evil.
Xander Out of marrow and bone...
Buffy Out of house and home... never to come here again.
Giles Oh, my God!
Giles You all right?
Buffy Get back!
Xander Check it.
Xander I'd say school's out for good.
Giles The good news is none of you girls were shot. Well, we've established, based on all the parallels and-and-and Buffy's visions, that it's James' spirit.
Willow So what do we do, Giles? About James.
Giles Well, he's obviously reliving the night of the Sadie Hawkins Dance when he killed Ms. Newman. It-it's-it's common enough for a spirit to do this, to... recreate a, a tragedy.
Cordelia Hey. If Sunnydale High School shuts down forever, do we automatically graduate?
Xander But why? What does he want? Actually, that's an interesting point.
Giles He's, he's trying to... resolve whatever issues are keeping him in limbo. W-w-what exactly those are, I'm not...
Buffy He wants forgiveness.
Giles Yes. I imagine he does. But when James possesses people, they act out exactly what happened that night. So he's experiencing a form of purgatory instead. I mean, he's, he's doomed to, to kill his Ms. Newman over and over and over again, and... forgiveness is impossible.
Buffy Good. He doesn't deserve it.
Giles To forgive is an act of compassion, Buffy. It's, it's not done because people deserve it. It's done because they need it.
Buffy No. James destroyed the one person he loved the most in a moment of blind passion. And that's not something you forgive. No matter why he did what he did. And no matter if he knows now that it was wrong and selfish and stupid, it is just something he's gonna have to live with.
Xander He can't live with it, Buff. He's dead.
Cordelia Okay. Overidentify much?
Voice I need you.
Willow So what do we do next? Do we go in again?
Giles Well, not now. No, the, uh... the spirit is too angry, too, too powerful. No, we have to work out exactly how and, and if this thing can be defeated.
Willow Hey, Buffy, are you...
Willow Oh, God. Giles! She went back.
Xander So what now? Not even a mega-vat of Raid's gonna do the trick here.
Cordelia I don't get it. Is she trying to be a big loner hero or something?
Giles No. I believe she's under the spirit's thrall. He's, he's calling her.
Cordelia But why?
Giles James needs her to re-enact everything that happened on the night that he, he killed Ms. Newman. He wants to change things, make, make a happy ending.
Willow But it can't ever happen! It always ends the same, which means Buffy just went in there to get shot, Giles.
Giles Yes. But the school's deserted. There's no way for James to... to play his part. There's, there's no man inside for him to possess.
Xander So Buffy should be safe until we find a way to get her out.
Willow In theory, yeah.
Angelus Fun fact about wasps.
Angelus They have no taste for the undead. Not that a sting would do me any damage, it's just... tonight's special. I wanted to look my best for you.
Buffy You're the only one. The only person I can talk to.
Angelus Gosh, Buff. That's really pathetic.
Buffy You can't make me disappear just because you say it's over.
Angelus Actually... I can. In fact... I just want you to be able to have some kind of normal life. We can never have that, don't you see?
Buffy I don't give a *damn* about a normal life! I'm going crazy not seeing you. I think about you every minute.
Ms._Newman I know. But it's over. It has to be!
Buffy Come back here! We're not finished!
Buffy You don't care anymore, is that it?
Angelus It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what I feel.
Buffy Then tell me you don't love me!
James Say it!
Ms._Newman Is that what you need to hear? Will that help? I don't.
Angelus I don't. Now let me go.
Buffy No. A person doesn't just wake up and stop loving somebody!
Buffy Love is forever. I'm not afraid to use it, I swear! If I can't be with you...
Angelus Oh, my God!
James DON'T WALK AWAY FROM ME...
Buffy ...BITCH!
Buffy Stop it! Stop it! Don't make me!
Angelus All right. Just...
Ms._Newman You know you don't want to do this. Let's both... just calm down. Now give me the gun.
James Don't. Don't do that, damn it!
Buffy Don't talk to me like I'm some stupid...
Angelus James.
Buffy Grace!
Angelus Don't do this.
Buffy But-but I killed you.
Angelus It was an accident. It wasn't your fault.
Buffy Oh, it *is* my fault. How could I...
Angelus Shhh. I'm the one who should be sorry, James. You thought I stopped loving you. But I never did. I loved you with my last breath.
Angelus Shhh... No more tears.
Buffy Angel.
Willow Everything seems normal. Not a snake, not a wasp.
Cordelia Yep. School can open again tomorrow.
Xander Explain to me again how that's a good thing.
Cordelia I'm drawing a blank.
Giles Are you feeling any better?
Buffy James picked me. I guess... I guess I was the one he could relate to. He was so sad.
Giles Well... they can both rest now.
Buffy I still... A part of me just doesn't understand why she would forgive him.
Giles Does it matter?
Buffy No. I guess not.
Spike You might want to let up. They say when you've drawn blood, you've exfoliated.
Angelus What do you know about it? I'm the one who was friggin' violated. You didn't have this thing in you.
Drusilla What was it? A demon?
Angelus Love!
Drusilla Poor Angel.
Angelus Let's get outta here. I need a real vile kill before sunup to wipe this crap out of my system.
Drusilla Of course. We'll find you a nice toddler.
Drusilla Want to come, pet?
Angelus No can do, Dru. I'm sure he'd be hell on wheels, but we don't have much time. Gotta travel light. Sorry. Try to have fun without me.
Spike Oh, I will.
Spike Sooner than you think.

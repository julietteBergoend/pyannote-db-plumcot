willow_rosenberg No! Get off!
buffy_summers Hey!
willow_rosenberg Xander!
willow_rosenberg Xander, are you okay?
xander_harris Man, something hit me.
buffy_summers Where's Jesse?
willow_rosenberg I don't know! They surrounded us.
xander_harris That girl grabbed him and took off.
buffy_summers Which way?
xander_harris I don't know.
buffy_summers Jesse.
werewolf Howl.
rupert_giles This world is older than any of you know. Contrary to popular mythology, it did not begin as a paradise. For untold eons demons walked the Earth. They made it their home, their... their Hell. But in time they lost their purchase on this reality. The way was made for mortal animals, for, for man. All that remains of the old ones are vestiges, certain magicks, certain creatures.
buffy_summers And vampires.
xander_harris Okay, this is where I have a problem. See, because we're talking about vampires. We're having a *talk* with vampires in it.
willow_rosenberg Isn't that what we saw last night?
buffy_summers No. No, th-those weren't vampires, those were just guys in thundering need of a facial. Or maybe they had rabies. It could have been rabies. A-and that guy turning to dust? Just a trick of light. That's exactly what I said the first time I saw a vampire. Well, after I was done with the screaming part.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I-I need to sit down.
buffy_summers You are sitting down.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Good for me.
xander_harris So vampires are demons?
rupert_giles The books tell the last demon to leave this reality fed off a human, mixed their blood. He was a human form possessed, infected by the demon's soul. He bit another, and another, and so they walk the Earth, feeding... Killing some, mixing their blood with others to make more of their kind. Waiting for the animals to die out, and the old ones to return.
luke Move!
the_master Is this for me?
luke An offering, Master.
darla He's a good one! His blood is pure!
the_master You've tasted it.
the_master I'm your... faithful dog. You bring me scraps.
darla I, I didn't mean it
the_master I have waited. For three score years I have waited. While you come and go I am stuck here, here in this house of... worship! My ascension is almost at hand. Pray that when it comes... I'm in a better mood.
darla Master, forgive me! We had more offerings, but there was trouble. A girl!
luke And there was a girl. She fought well and she knew of our breed. It is possible that she may be...
the_master A Slayer!
xander_harris And that would be a what?
rupert_giles For as long as there have been vampires, there's been the Slayer. One girl in all the world, a Chosen One.
buffy_summers He loves doing this part.
rupert_giles Alright. The Slayer hunts vampires, Buffy is a Slayer, don't tell anyone. Well, I think that's all the vampire information you need.
xander_harris Except for one thing: how do you kill them?
buffy_summers *You* don't, *I* do.
xander_harris Well, Jesse's my
buffy_summers Jesse is *my* responsibility. I let him get taken.
xander_harris That's not true.
willow_rosenberg If you hadn't shown up they would have taken us, too. Does anybody mind if I pass out?
buffy_summers Breathe.
willow_rosenberg Breathe.
buffy_summers Breathe. This big guy, Luke. He talked about an offering to the Master. Now, I don't know what or who, but if they weren't just feeding then Jesse may still be alive. I'm gonna find him.
willow_rosenberg Uh, this may be the dumb question, but shouldn't we call the police?
rupert_giles And they'd believe us, of course.
willow_rosenberg Well, we don't have to say vampires. We, we could just say that there's a, a bad man.
buffy_summers They couldn't handle it even of they did show up. They'd only come with guns.
rupert_giles You have no idea where they took Jesse?
buffy_summers I looked around, but soon as they got clear of the graveyard, they could have just, voom!
xander_harris They can fly?
buffy_summers They can drive.
xander_harris Oh.
willow_rosenberg I don't remember hearing a car.
rupert_giles Let's take an enormous intuitive leap, shall we, and say they went underground.
buffy_summers Vampires really jam on sewer systems. You can get anywhere in the entire town without catching any rays. But I didn't see any access around there.
xander_harris Well, there's an electrical tunnel that runs under the whole town.
rupert_giles If we had a diagnostic of the tunnel system it might indicate a, a meeting place, it would, uh... I suppose we could go to the building commission.
buffy_summers We *so* don't have time.
willow_rosenberg Uh, guys? There may be another way.
the_master A Slayer! Have you any proof?
luke Only that she fought me, and yet lives.
the_master Hmm, very nearly proof enough. I can't remember the last time that happened.
luke 1843. Madrid. He caught me sleeping.
the_master She mustn't be allowed to interfere with the Harvest!
luke I would never let that happen!
the_master Don't worry about it. I believe she'll come to us. We have something she wants.
the_master If she is a Slayer, and this boy lives, she'll try to save him.
luke I thought you nothing more than a meal, boy.
luke Congratulations, you've just been upgraded. To bait.
buffy_summers There it is.
willow_rosenberg That runs under the graveyard.
xander_harris I don't see any access.
rupert_giles So, all the city plans are just, uh, open to the public?
willow_rosenberg Um, well, i-in a way. I sort of stumbled onto them when I accidentally decrypted the city council's security system.
xander_harris Someone's been naughty.
buffy_summers There's nothing here, this is useless!
rupert_giles I think you're being a bit hard on yourself.
buffy_summers You're the one that told me that I wasn't prepared enough. Understatement! I thought I was on top of everything, and then that monster, Luke, came out of nowhere...
xander_harris What?
buffy_summers He didn't come out of nowhere. He came from behind me. I was facing the entrance, he came from behind me, and he didn't follow me out. The access to the tunnels is in the mausoleum! The girl must have doubled back with Jesse after I got out! God! I am so mentally challenged!
xander_harris So, what's the plan? We saddle up, right?
buffy_summers There's no 'we', okay? I'm the Slayer, and you're not.
xander_harris I knew you'd throw that back in my face.
buffy_summers Xander, this is deeply dangerous.
xander_harris I'm inadequate. That's fine. I'm less than a man.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, I'm not anxious to go into a dark place full of monsters. But I do want to help. I need to.
rupert_giles Well, then help me. I've been researching this Harvest affair. It seems to be some sort of preordained massacre. Rivers of blood, Hell on Earth, quite charmless. I'm a bit fuzzy, however, on the details. It may be that you can wrest some information from that dread machine.
rupert_giles That was a bit, um, British, wasn't it?
buffy_summers Welcome to the New World.
rupert_giles I want you to go on the 'Net.
willow_rosenberg Oh, sure, I can do that.
buffy_summers Then I'm outta here. If Jesse's alive, I'll bring him back.
rupert_giles Do I have to tell you to be careful?
principal_bob_flutie And where do we think we're going?
buffy_summers We? I... Me...
principal_bob_flutie We're not leaving school grounds, are we?
buffy_summers No! No, I'm... just admiring the fence. You know, this is quality fence work.
principal_bob_flutie Because if we were leaving schools grounds on our second day at a new school, after getting kicked out of our old school for delinquent behavior... Do you see where I'm going with this?
buffy_summers Mr. Giles...
principal_bob_flutie What?
buffy_summers He asked me to get a book for him. Uh, from the store, 'cause I have a free period, and I'm a big reader. Did it mention that in my transcripts?
principal_bob_flutie Mr. Giles?
buffy_summers Ask him.
principal_bob_flutie Well, maybe that's how they do things in *Britain*, they've got that royal family and all kinds of problems, but here at Sunnydale nobody leaves campus while school's in session. Are we clear?
buffy_summers We're clear.
principal_bob_flutie That's the Buffy Summers I want in my school. Sensible girl with her feet on the ground!
willow_rosenberg Murder, death, disaster. What else?
xander_harris Paranormal, unexplained, did you get natural disasters?
willow_rosenberg Earthquake, flood.
xander_harris Rain of Toads.
willow_rosenberg Right.
xander_harris Rain of Toads! Do you think they'd have anything like that in the paper?
willow_rosenberg I'll put it on the computer search. If it's in there, it'll turn up. Anything that'll lead us to vampires.
xander_harris And I, in the meantime, will help by standing around like an idiot.
willow_rosenberg Not like an idiot, just... standing. Buffy doesn't want you getting hurt.
willow_rosenberg I don't want you getting hurt.
xander_harris This is just too much. I mean, yesterday my life's like, 'Uh-oh, pop quiz.' Today it's 'Rain of Toads'.
willow_rosenberg I know. And everyone else thinks it's just a normal day.
xander_harris Nobody knows. It's like we've got this big secret.
willow_rosenberg We do. That's what a secret is, when you know something other guys don't.
xander_harris Right. Look, maybe you should get to class.
willow_rosenberg You mean 'we'. We should get to class.
xander_harris Yeah.
willow_rosenberg Buffy'll be okay. Whatever's down there, I think she can handle it.
xander_harris Yeah, I do, too.
willow_rosenberg So do I!
buffy_summers I don't suppose you've got a key on you?
angel They really don't like me dropping in.
buffy_summers Why not?
angel They really don't like me.
buffy_summers How could that possibly be?
angel I knew you'd figure out this entryway sooner or later. Actually, I thought it was gonna be a *little* sooner.
buffy_summers Sorry you had to wait. Okay. Look, if you're gonna be popping up with this Cryptic Wise Man act on a regular basis, can you at least tell me your name?
angel Angel.
buffy_summers Angel. It's a pretty name.
angel Don't... go down there.
buffy_summers Deal with my going.
angel You shouldn't be putting yourself at risk. Tonight is the Harvest. Unless you can prevent it, the Master walks.
buffy_summers Well, if this Harvest thing is such a suckfest, why don't *you* stop it?
angel 'Cause I'm afraid.
angel They'll be expecting you.
buffy_summers I've got a friend down there. Or at least a potential friend. Do you know what it's like to have a friend?
buffy_summers That wasn't supposed to be a stumper.
angel When you hit the tunnels head east towards the school. That's where you're likely to find them.
buffy_summers You gonna wish me luck?
angel Good luck!
xander_harris Did you see anything?
buffy_summers Xander, what are you doing here?!
xander_harris Something stupid. I followed you.
buffy_summers Well, you
xander_harris I couldn't just sit at home and do nothing.
buffy_summers I understand. Now, go away!
xander_harris No!
buffy_summers Xander, you're gonna have to.
xander_harris Look, Jesse's my bud, okay? If I can help him out, that's what I gotta do.
xander_harris Besides, it's this or chem class.
xander_harris Okay, so, crosses, garlic, stake through the heart.
buffy_summers That'll get it done.
xander_harris Cool! Of course, I don't actually have any of those things.
buffy_summers Good thinking.
xander_harris Well, the part of my brain that would tell me to bring that stuff is still busy telling me not to come down here. I have this, though.
buffy_summers Turn that off!
xander_harris Okay! Okay! So, what else?
buffy_summers What else what?
xander_harris For vampire slayage.
buffy_summers Oh, fire, beheading, sunlight, holy water, the usual.
xander_harris You've done some beheading in your time?
buffy_summers Oh, yeah. There was this time I was pinned down by this guy that played left tackle for varsity... Well, at least he used to before he was a vampire... Anyway, he had this really, really thick neck, and all I had was a little, little Exact-O knife...
buffy_summers You're not loving this story.
xander_harris No, actually, I find it oddly comforting.
rupert_giles 'For they will gather and be gathered. From the Vessel pours life.' P... Pours life...
rupert_giles 'On the night of the crescent moon, the first past the solstice it will come...' Of course. That's tonight!
cordelia_chase No! It's supposed to find the syntax and match it. Or wait...
harmony_kendall Are we going to the Bronze tonight?
cordelia_chase No, we're going to the other cool place in Sunnydale.
cordelia_chase Of course we're going to the Bronze. Friday night? No cover? But you should have been there last night. 'Cause I ran into Buffy...
cordelia_chase ...and can she be any weirder? She attacked me! Do you believe it?
harmony_kendall I think we did this part wrong.
cordelia_chase Why do we have to devise these programs, isn't that what nerds are for? What'd she do?
harmony_kendall Uh, she's doing something else.
cordelia_chase Okay, and then pattern run, right? Or go to end? That's it!
harmony_kendall Maybe!
cordelia_chase So anyway, I come outta the bathroom, and she comes running at me. Screaming! With a stick! 'I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!' I swear!
boy Who?
cordelia_chase Buffy!
harmony_kendall The new girl?
boy What's her deal?
cordelia_chase Well, she's crazed.
harmony_kendall Did you hear about her old school?
harmony_kendall Booted.
cordelia_chase Well, I exhibit no surprise.
boy Why was she kicked out?
cordelia_chase Uh, because she's a psycho loony!
willow_rosenberg No, she's not.
cordelia_chase What?
willow_rosenberg She's not a psycho. You don't even know her.
cordelia_chase Excuse me? Who gave you permission to exist?
cordelia_chase Do I horn in on your private discussions? No. Why? Because you're boring.
harmony_kendall Okay, I think the program's done.
cordelia_chase Finally the nightmare ends! Okay, so how do we save it?
willow_rosenberg Deliver.
cordelia_chase Deliver? Where's that? Oh!
buffy_summers They're close.
xander_harris How can you tell?
buffy_summers No more rats.
xander_harris Jesse!
buffy_summers Oh, no!
xander_harris J-J-Jesse!
jesse Xander!
xander_harris Jesse, man, are you okay?
jesse I am not okay, on an *epic* scale.
jesse We gotta get outta here!
xander_harris It's cool, Buffy's a superhero.
buffy_summers Hold on...
xander_harris Do you think anyone heard that?
jesse They knew you were gonna come. They said that I... I was the bait.
xander_harris Oh, great, now you tell us.
buffy_summers Oops!
jesse Oh, no, no, no, no!
buffy_summers Do you know another way out?
jesse I dunno. Maybe. C'mon!
jesse Wait, wait. They brought me through here, there, there should be a way up. I hope!
buffy_summers I don't think this is the way out!
xander_harris We can't fight our way back through those things. What do we do?
jesse I got an idea. You can die!
xander_harris Jesse, man. I'm sorry.
jesse Sorry? I feel good, Xander! I feel strong! I'm connected, man, to everything!
jesse I, I can hear the worms in the earth!
xander_harris That's a plus.
jesse I know what the Master wants. I'll serve his purpose. That means you die. And I feed.
buffy_summers Xander, the cross!
xander_harris Jesse, man. We're buds, don't you remember?
jesse You're like a shadow to me now.
xander_harris Then get outta my face.
buffy_summers Help me!
buffy_summers We need to get out of here!
xander_harris There is no out of here!
xander_harris Up there!
buffy_summers Go!
buffy_summers Xander, pull!
the_master She escaped? She walks free when I should be drinking her heart's blood right now? Careless...
colin Master, we had her trapped!
the_master Oh, are you going to make excuses?
the_master You are all weak. It has been too long since you have faced the Slayer. Huh. It is no matter to me. She will not stop the Harvest. Just means there'll be someone worth killing... when I reach the surface. Is Luke ready?
colin He waits.
the_master It's time. Bring him to me.
the_master Ah, Colin... You failed me. Tell me you're sorry.
colin I'm sorry!
the_master There. That wasn't so bad, was it? Hold on...
the_master You've got something in your eye.
rupert_giles Buffy?
willow_rosenberg It's just me. So there's no word?
rupert_giles Ah, not as yet, no.
willow_rosenberg Well, I-I'm sure they're... great.
rupert_giles Did you find anything of interest?
willow_rosenberg I think, maybe... I surfed through the old newspapers around the time of that big earthquake back in '37? And for several months before there were a rash of murders.
rupert_giles Great! I-I mean, well, not, not 'great' in a good way, uh, um, uh, go on?
willow_rosenberg Well, they sound like the kind you were looking for. Throats, blood...
rupert_giles It's all coming together. I rather wish it weren't.
the_master My blood is your blood. My soul is your soul.
luke My body is your instrument.
the_master On this... most hallowed night... we are as one. Luke is the Vessel!
the_master Every soul he takes will feed me. And their souls will grant me the strength to free myself. Tonight I shall walk the Earth, and the stars themselves will hide!
willow_rosenberg Did you find Jesse?
xander_harris Yeah.
willow_rosenberg Was he dead?
buffy_summers Worse. I'm sorry, Willow. We were too late. And they were waiting for us.
willow_rosenberg At least you two are okay.
xander_harris I don't like vampires. I'm gonna take a stand and say they're not good.
buffy_summers So, Giles! Got anything that can make this day any worse?
rupert_giles How about the end of the world?
buffy_summers Knew I could count on you.
rupert_giles This is what we know. Some sixty years ago, a very old, very powerful vampire came to this shore, not just to feed.
buffy_summers He came 'cause this town's a mystical who's it.
rupert_giles Yes. The Spanish who first settled here called it 'Boca del Infierno'. Roughly translated, 'Hellmouth'. It's a sort of, um, portal between this reality and the next. This vampire hopes to open it.
buffy_summers Bring the demons back.
xander_harris End of the world.
willow_rosenberg But he blew it! Or, I mean, there was an earthquake that swallowed half the town, and him, too.
rupert_giles You see, opening dimensional portals is a tricky business. Odds are he got himself stuck, rather like a, uh, cork in a bottle.
xander_harris And this Harvest thing is to get him out.
rupert_giles It comes once in a century, on this night. The Master can draw power from one of his minions while it feeds. Enough power to break free and open the portal. The minion is called the Vessel, and he bears this symbol.
buffy_summers So, I dust anyone sporting that symbol, and no Harvest.
rupert_giles Simply put, yes.
buffy_summers Any idea where this little get-together is being held?
rupert_giles There, there are a number of possibilities.
xander_harris They're goin' to the Bronze.
willow_rosenberg Are you sure?
xander_harris Come on. All those tasty young morsels all over the place? Anyway, that's where Jesse's gonna be, trust me.
rupert_giles Then we should get there. The sun will be down before long.
buffy_summers I gotta make a stop. Won't take long.
rupert_giles What for?
buffy_summers Supplies.
joyce_summers Buffy?
buffy_summers Mom!
joyce_summers You're going out?
buffy_summers I have to.
joyce_summers I didn't hear you come in last night.
buffy_summers I was really quiet.
joyce_summers It's happening again, isn't it? I got a call from your new principal. Says you missed some classes today?
buffy_summers I was running an errand.
joyce_summers We haven't finished unpacking, and I'm getting calls from the principal.
buffy_summers Mom, I promise, it is *not* gonna be like before. But I *have* to go.
joyce_summers No.
buffy_summers Mom?!
joyce_summers The tapes all say I should get used to saying it. No.
buffy_summers This is really, really important.
joyce_summers I know. If you don't go out it'll be the end of the world. Everything is life or death when you're a sixteen-year-old girl.
buffy_summers Look, I don't have time to talk about this...
joyce_summers Buffy, you've got all the time in the world, you're not going anywhere. Now, if you wanna stay up here and sulk, I won't hold it against you. But if you wanna come down, I'll make us some dinner.
cordelia_chase Senior boys are the only way to go. Guys from our grade, forget about it, they're children. Y'know? Like Jesse. Did you see him last night, following me around like a little puppy dog. You just wanna put him to sleep. But senior boys, hmm, they have mystery. They have... What's the word I'm searching for? Cars! I just am not the type to settle. Y'know? It's like when I go shopping. I have to have the most expensive thing. Not because it's expensive, but because it costs more.
girl You know, I
cordelia_chase Hello, Miss Motormouth, can I get a sentence finished? Oh, I love this song! Come on!
cordelia_chase Uh, what do you want?
cordelia_chase Hey! Hello! Caveman brain! What are you doing?
jesse Shut up!
cordelia_chase Well, just one dance.
Doorman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode02 Need ID. Hey! Nobody gets inside until I get some sorta
luke Get inside.
luke Ladies and Gentlemen! There is no cause for alarm. Actually, there is cause for alarm. It just won't do any good.
cordelia_chase I thought there wasn't any band tonight.
luke This is a glorious night! It is also the last one any of you shall ever see. Bring me the first.
Doorman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode02 What do you guys want, man, huh? You want money? Man, what's wrong with your faces?
luke Watch me, people. Fear is like an elixir. It's almost like blood.
luke Next!
buffy_summers It's locked!
rupert_giles We're too late!
buffy_summers Well I didn't know I was gonna get grounded!
xander_harris Can you break it down?
buffy_summers No, not that thing. Um... You guys try the back entrance, and I'll find my own way.
rupert_giles Right. Come on.
buffy_summers Um, wait! Guys! Here! You get the exit cleared and the people out. That's all! Don't go Wild Bunch on me.
rupert_giles Uh, see you inside, then.
willow_rosenberg No joy!
xander_harris We've gotta get in there before Jesse does something stupider than usual.
rupert_giles You listen to me! Jesse is dead! You have to remember that when you see him, you're not looking at your friend. You're looking at the thing that killed him.
the_master Almost free!
the_master Give me moooooore!
jesse This one's mine!
darla They're all for the Master.
jesse I don't get one?
luke I feel the Master's strength growing!
luke I feel him rising. Every soul brings him closer! I need another!
buffy_summers The Vessel.
luke Tonight is his ascension. Tonight will be history at its end! Yours is a glorious sacrifice! Degradation most holy. What? No volunteers?!
darla Here's a pretty one.
buffy_summers Oh, I'm sorry, were you in the middle of something?
luke You!
buffy_summers You didn't think I'd miss this. Did you?
luke I hoped you'd come.
buffy_summers Be right down!
buffy_summers Okay, Vessel boy. You want blood?
luke I want yours! Only yours!
buffy_summers Works for me.
rupert_giles Hurry!
xander_harris C'mon! Let's go! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
rupert_giles Hurry up! Come on! Through this door! Come on! This way!
xander_harris Head's up!
jesse Hold still! You're not making this easy!
xander_harris Jesse, man! Don't make me do it.
jesse Buddy!
luke I always wanted to kill a Slayer!
rupert_giles One at a time! Quickly! Quickly!
rupert_giles We're going to have to open the front as well!
xander_harris Jesse! I know there's still a part of you in there.
jesse Okay... Let's deal with this. Jesse was an excruciating loser who couldn't get a date with anyone in the sighted community! Look at me. I'm a new man!
luke Master! Taste of this... and be free!
buffy_summers How'd it taste?
willow_rosenberg Get off of him!
jesse Ooo! Alright. Put me out of my misery. You don't have the guts.
luke You forget, metal can't hurt me.
buffy_summers There's something you forgot about, too. Sunrise!
buffy_summers It's in about nine hours, moron!
the_master Noooooooo! Noooooooo!
angel She did it! I'll be damned!
rupert_giles I take it it's over.
willow_rosenberg Did we win?
buffy_summers Well, we averted the Apocalypse. I give us points for that.
xander_harris One thing's for sure: nothing's ever gonna be the same.
cordelia_chase Well, I heard it was rival gangs. You know, fighting for turf? But all I can tell you is they were an ugly way of looking. And Buffy, like, knew them! Which is just too weird. I mean, I don't even remember that much, but I'm telling you, it was a freak show!
girl Oh, I wish I'd been there!
cordelia_chase You should have been there. It was so creepy...
buffy_summers What exactly were you expecting?
xander_harris I don't know, something. I mean, the dead rose. We should at least have an assembly.
rupert_giles People have a tendency to rationalize what they can and forget what they can't.
buffy_summers Believe me, I've seen it happen.
willow_rosenberg Well, I'll never forget it, none of it.
rupert_giles Good! Next time you'll be prepared.
xander_harris Next time?
willow_rosenberg Next time is why?
rupert_giles We've prevented the Master from freeing himself and opening the Mouth of Hell. That's not to say he's going to stop trying. I'd say the fun is just beginning.
willow_rosenberg More vampires?
rupert_giles Not just vampires. The next threat we face may be something quite different.
buffy_summers I can hardly wait!
rupert_giles We're at the center of a mystical convergence here. We may, in fact, stand between the Earth and its total destruction.
buffy_summers Well, I gotta look on the bright side. Maybe I can still get kicked out of school!
xander_harris Oh, yeah, that's a plan. 'Cause lots of schools aren't on Hellmouths.
willow_rosenberg Maybe you could blow something up. They're really strict about that.
buffy_summers I was thinking of a more subtle approach, y'know, like excessive not studying.
rupert_giles The Earth is doomed!

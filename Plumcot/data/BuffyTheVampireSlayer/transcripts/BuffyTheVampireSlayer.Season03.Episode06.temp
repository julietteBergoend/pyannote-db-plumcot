Giles 'And on that tragic day, an era came to its inevitable end.' That's all there is. Are you ready?
Buffy Hit me.
Giles Which of the following best expresses the theme of the passage? A) Violence breeds violence, B) All things must end, C)...
Buffy 'B'. I'm going with 'B'. We haven't had 'B' in forever.
Giles This is the SATs, Buffy, not connect-the-dots. Please pay attention. A low score could seriously harm your chances of getting into college.
Buffy Gee, thanks. That takes the pressure right off.
Giles This isn't meant to be easy, you know. It's a rite of passage.
Buffy Well, is it too late to join a tribe where they just pierce something or cut something off?
Giles Buffy, please concentrate.
Buffy Roll!
Giles What?
Buffy Hmm. I broke my No. 2 pencil. We'll have to do this again sometime.
Giles C) All systems tend towards chaos.
Buffy I just know that us and the undead are the only people in Sunnydale working this late.
Mayor_Wilkins I appreciate you coming.
Mayor_Wilkins I realize it is early... for you... but I think you'll agree that this matter is urgent, also... delicate.
Trick I'm a very delicate person.
Mayor_Wilkins So you feel you can handle this?
Trick It's a little out of my element, but I can get you what you need. I know a beast who knows a guy.
Mayor_Wilkins Are you sure that subcontracting is the way to go here?
Trick Well, this guy's worked your town before, and if he lives up to his rep, this place'll be in flames.
Mayor_Wilkins I've made certain deals to get where I am today. This demon requires his tribute. You see, that's what separates me from other politicians, Mr. Trick.
Mayor_Wilkins I *keep* my campaign promises.
Mayor_Wilkins Where'd I put that Scotch?
Buffy And then I was being chased by an improperly filled-in answer bubble screaming, 'none of the above!'
Willow Wow. I hope that wasn't one of your prophecy dreams. Probably not.
Oz Hey, you know, I took it last year. I could help you get ready. There's this whole trick to antonyms, but... this isn't the place.
Willow Oz is the highest-scoring person ever to fail to graduate.
Buffy Isn't she cute when she's proud?
Oz She's always cute.
Willow We could work on it tonight.
Xander Work on what tonight?
Cordelia Oh, God. Are we killing something again?
Buffy Only my carefree spirit.
Oz Buffy SAT prep.
Willow Oz is helping. He's the highest-scoring...
Cordelia We know. We did the impressed thing already.
Xander I hate they make us take that thing. It's totally fascist, and personally, I think it, uh, discriminates against the uninformed.
Cordelia Actually, I'm looking forward to it. I do well on standardized tests.
Cordelia What? I can't have layers?
Willow So, Buff, study tonight?
Buffy Uh, yes on the studying, no on tonight. I'm putting in Mom time. She's been drastic ever since I got back. And Giles is even worse. I'm supervised 24-7.
Buffy It's like being in the Real World house, only real.
Willow Hmm.
Willow Ooh, candy bars! Lots of 'em!
Xander Principal Snyder, thank you! You weren't visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, by any chance?
Snyder It's band candy.
Buffy Let's hear it for the band, huh? Very generous.
Snyder You will sell it to raise money for the marching band. They need new uniforms.
Xander Yeah. Those tall, fuzzy hats ain't cheap, huh?
Oz But they go with everything.
Buffy I'm sure we love the idea of going all Willy Loman, but we're not in the band.
Snyder And if I'd handed you a trombone, that would've been a problem, Summers. It's candy. Sell it.
Joyce But you're not in the band.
Buffy And yet.
Joyce Buffy, what would I do with forty chocolate bars?
Buffy You could hand them out at the Gallery. 'Buy something Pre-Columbian, get a free cavity.'
Joyce Twenty.
Buffy You're a good mom.
Joyce I'm the best.
Buffy No, I'm pretty sure the best moms let their daughters drive.
Joyce And yet.
Buffy Oh, come on!
Joyce Look, let's not have this conversation.
Buffy But I took the class. I watched the filmstrips with the blood and the death and the corpses. I'm prepped.
Joyce Honey, you failed the written test. They wouldn't even let you *take* the road test.
Buffy That was a year ago. And I don't test well... she said, two days before the SATs.
Joyce I spend enough time not knowing where you are. I don't wanna add to that the possibility that you're on the highway to Chicago.
Buffy I can't believe you. I'm *not* taking off again. Besides, if I wanted to, I could just get on a bus.
Joyce Stop. Don't. I just don't want you driving, okay? I want you here.
Buffy I'm here. Hmm? See me here. Mm-hm?
Buffy Mm... I gotta go.
Joyce What, you're going out?
Buffy Giles. Slay-study double feature. Could be late.
Joyce Again? Honey, don't you think Mr. Giles is monopolizing an awful lot of your time?
Buffy And does he ever say he's sorry?
Buffy Ow!
Giles Sorry.
Buffy Why do I put up with this?
Giles Because it is your destiny... and because I just bought twenty 'cocorific' candy bars.
Buffy Okay, you're just doing this to take funny pictures of me.
Giles I'm doing it to test your awareness of an opponent's location during a fight in total darkness. Now, wait five seconds and then throw the ball at me.
Buffy You ran out of new training ideas about a week ago, huh? Okay. Five, four, three, two, one.
Giles It's not that simple, is it...
Giles Ow. Ahem. Yes, well, very good.
Buffy Thanks!
Giles W-w-w-where are you going? We have to patrol!
Buffy I can't. Mom's in hyperdrive. She wants me home tonight. I told you.
Giles But, I...
Buffy I know, I know. She's out of control. Enjoy the candy!
Angel Buffy.
Buffy I didn't know you could do that.
Angel I-I'm feeling better.
Buffy Angel...
Buffy Let's... get you inside.
Angel It's late. How'd you get away?
Buffy Aw, it was easy. Started a fire in the prison laundry room. Rode out in the garbage truck.
Angel Oh.
Buffy I'm joking. No garbage. Smell me.
Angel How is, uh... Scott?
Buffy Scott? Oh, um... boyfriend Scott. Uh... A-actually, he's not... He's fine.
Buffy Uh, that's for you.
Buffy Uh... I-it's fresh from the butcher.
Angel Thanks.
Angel You're being careful, right?
Buffy With Scott?
Angel The slaying.
Buffy Oh. Uh... Yeah. Of course. Full of carefulness.
Angel I worry about you.
Buffy I worry about *you*.
Angel I'm getting stronger.
Buffy Yeah, pretty soon, you won't even need me.
Angel That'll be better.
Buffy Yeah.
Buffy Hey! Uh, sorry I'm late. You know Giles. All slay, all the time.
Giles Hello, Buffy.
Buffy Do you guys wanna watch some television? I hear there's a very insightful Nightline on.
Joyce Buffy, you lied to us. And you made us into your alibis. That's... playing us against each other, and that's not fair.
Giles I called Willow. You also lied to her about your whereabouts. We were all concerned.
Giles Oh, thank you.
Buffy Look, I'm sorry, but I had to...
Joyce Were you at the Bronze? What was happening there that was so important?
Buffy Bronze things. Things of Bronze.
Joyce You're acting really immature, Buffy.
Giles I know I'm not your parent, but I am responsible for you. I think your mum's right.
Buffy Okay, fine. I'm acting like a child. Maybe that's because you're both treating me like a child.
Joyce Buffy!
Buffy You're both scheduling me twenty-four hours a day. Between the two of you, that's forty-eight hours. I just wanna be able to make a few decisions on my own.
Joyce The last time you made a decision on your own, you split.
Buffy Yeah, and I took care of myself. I don't need this much active parenting.
Joyce You can't really be trying to use this summer as a reason you should be trusted.
Buffy You can't babysit me all the time. I need you to back off a little.
Giles Uh, alright, come on. Let's, let's not, uh, freak out.
Buffy 'Freak out'?
Giles Mm-hm. Uh, I think you should go to bed. Um, we're all tired.
Joyce Oh, she just drives me crazy!
Joyce I just want to protect her.
Giles Don't all parents want that?
Joyce Yeah, but at least most parents have some idea what to protect their children from.
Giles Yeah. And I think we should both be especially careful.
Joyce Mm.
Ethan Trust me. You don't want to eat that.
Boy Think fast.
Cordelia I heard that there was a secret rule that if a teacher's more than ten minutes late, we can all leave.
Buffy It's Giles' turn to watch study hall. He'll be here. He's allergic to late.
Cordelia He is wound a little tight. I had this philosophy book checked out from the library for, like, a year, and he made me pay the fine, even though it was huge. I was sad to return it. It was perfect for starting conversations with college boys. Of course, that was B.X.
Buffy B.X.? Before Xander. Clever.
Xander I like chocolate. There is no bad here.
Willow You still have some left? I went to, like, four houses, and they were gone. It's like Trick-or-Treating in reverse.
Xander I know. These things are selling like hot cakes... which is ironic, 'cause the hot cakes really aren't moving...
Xander And it's, uh, ahem, fun to sell chocolate. Ahem.
Willow And we're raising a lot of money for the band.
Xander The band. Yeah. They're great. They march.
Willow Like an army. E-e-except with music instead of bullets, and... usually no one dies.
Cordelia I can't believe this.
Cordelia Where is Giles already? I'm bored, and he's not here to give me credit for it.
Snyder The big pinhead librarian didn't show up, and I don't wanna do it. You do it.
Ms._Barton Alright, fine. I'll do it.
Snyder Everybody expects me to do everything around here because I'm the principal. It's not fair.
Ms._Barton Hey! We're all stuck here, okay? So now let's just sit quietly and, and pretend we're reading something until we're really sure that old Commandant Snyder's gone. Then we're all outta here!
Xander Does anyone else wanna marry Ms. Barton?
Cordelia Get in line.
Willow I guess Giles isn't coming?
Buffy I guess not.
Giles Buffy.
Buffy Uh... sorry. I... I was just worried. You were a big not-there in study hall, and after your lecture to me on not ducking out... and what is my mother doing here?
Giles We had an opportunity for, um, you might say, a summit meeting. It took priority over study hall. I called in.
Buffy Oh.
Joyce We decided that you made a good point earlier, honey.
Buffy I did. Yeah. Which was...?
Joyce A-about us overscheduling you.
Giles Pulling you in two directions, uh, your home life and your duties as a Slayer.
Buffy Oh. That was a good point.
Joyce We're working out a coordinated schedule for you.
Giles It'll be tight, but, uh, I think we can fit in all your responsibilities.
Buffy Sounds nice and structured.
Joyce We've got more work to do here, honey. Why don't you give us a little more time?
Joyce Um... Take the car, and, um, Mr. Giles can drive me home.
Buffy What? Excuse me, I meant what?!
Joyce Keys. Take them.
Buffy You don't have to tell *me* twice. Well, actually, you did, but... bye!
Joyce Bye, honey. Drive careful.
Buffy Uh-huh!
Joyce Do you think she noticed anything?
Giles No way!
Willow Tell me again how it happened.
Buffy Told my mom I wanted to be treated more like a grownup, and voila: driviness.
Buffy Also, I think she wanted me otherwhere. Considering my mom and Giles are planning my future, I think it's easier for them to live my life if I'm not actually there.
Willow Do you know that you have the parking brake on?
Buffy Uh-huh.
Willow Are, are you sure about the Bronze? I mean, the SATs are tomorrow.
Buffy I can study at the Bronze. A little dancing, a little cross-multiplying. You know what we need?
Willow Eyes on the road! Eyes on the road!
Joyce You got good albums.
Giles Yeah, they're okay.
Joyce Do you like Seals and Croft?
Joyce Yeah, me neither.
Joyce Thanks.
Joyce So how come they, uh, call you Ripper?
Giles Wouldn't you like to know.
Giles Hmm, wait a minute. Listen to this bit.
Giles It rocks!
Joyce It's good.
Giles Man, I gotta get a band together.
Joyce Hey, Ripper, you wanna watch TV?
Joyce I know how to order pay-per-view.
Giles No, let's go out and have some fun.
Giles Tear things up a bit.
Joyce Okay. We could go to the Bronze.
Giles Not bloody likely. That place is dead.
Devon Hey, they're diggin' us, man!
Buffy Let's do the time warp again.
Willow Maybe there's a reunion in town or, or a Billy Joel tour or something.
Buffy Ms. Barton?
Ms._Barton Buffy? Whoa!
Willow Are you okay, Ms. Barton?
Ms._Barton Oh, I'm cool, Willow. Willow... That's a tree. You're a tree!
Ms._Barton Yeah, uh, uh, are there any nachos in here, little tree?
Buffy A-are you sure you don't need some fresh air, Ms. Barton?
Ms._Barton Okay...
Willow Hey, this is not normal.
Willow Uh, w-well, maybe that goes without saying.
Snyder Hey, gang! This place is Fun City, huh?
Buffy Principal Snyder?
Snyder Call me Snyder. Just a last name, like... Barbarino.
Snyder Ooh! I'm so stoked!
Snyder Hey, did you see Ms. Barton? I think she's wasted.
Snyder I'm gonna have to put that in her next performance review 'cause... 'cause I'm the principal!
Willow I don't like this. They could have heart attacks.
Buffy Uh, well... ma-maybe there's a doctor here.
Man Yeeeeaaaaaah!
Willow I think that *is* my doctor.
Willow He-he's usually less... topless.
Snyder I got a commendation for being principal. From the Mayor! Shook my hand twice.
Buffy That's nice.
Snyder Whoa! There are some foxy ladies here tonight!
Willow What's happening?
Buffy I don't know, but it's happening to a whole lot of grownups.
Willow They're acting like a bunch...
Buffy They're acting like a bunch of us.
Willow I don't act like this.
Trick Demand's high.
Ethan I thought it might be.
Trick That's the reason I love this country. You make a good product, and the people will come to you. Of course, a lot of them are gonna die, but that's the other reason I love this country.
Trick Hey! Don't sample the product.
Man But I didn't.
Ethan Okay. Uh, how did you know he was...
Trick I don't. Now I know no one else will. We're getting close. Keep it flowing. It's almost feeding time.
Buffy Something's definitely changing them.
Willow A spell?
Oz They're teenagers. It's a sobering mirror to look into, huh?
Snyder You've got great hair.
Old_men Louie Louie / Oh, baby / We gotta go / Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah / Louie Louie / Oh, baby / We gotta go / Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Willow It just gets more upsetting.
Old_men Louie Louie / Oh, baby / We gotta go / Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Buffy No vampire has ever been *that* scary.
Old_men Louie Louie / Oh baby / We gotta go
Patron Fight!
Snyder Fight!
Buffy We've gotta figure out what's going on. This has Hellmouth fingerprints all over it.
Snyder Hey, where are we going?
Snyder Wait up, you guys!
Snyder Hey! You guys aren't trying to ditch me, are ya?
Oz We should find Giles. He'll know what's going on, right?
Buffy Sure. Except for all we know, he's sweet sixteen again.
Willow He's with your mom at his place.
Snyder I said, wait up!
Oz Uh, Snyder...
Buffy No time. He's coming with us.
Snyder Whoa, Summers! You drive like a spaz!
Willow It'll be okay when we get to Giles'.
Oz Of course, I mean, even if he's sixteen, he's still Giles, right? He's probably a pretty together guy.
Willow Yeah, well...
Oz What?
Buffy Giles at sixteen? Less Together Guy, more Bad-Magic-Hates-The-World-Ticking-Time-Bomb Guy.
Oz Well, then I guess your mom's in a lotta trouble.
Joyce Must be exciting being from England.
Giles Not particularly. You cold?
Joyce Nah-uh. I feel... special, like I'm just waking up, kinda.
Giles Oh, yeah?
Joyce Yeah, like, uh, getting married and having a kid and everything was just a dream, and now things are back like they're supposed to be.
Giles Yeah?
Joyce That's cool! Very Juice Newton.
Giles You fancy it?
Joyce Yeah, but the store's closed.
Giles Woo-hoo!
Joyce Oh, Ripper! Wow, that was sooo brave!
Officer Hold it!
Snyder This is great! Let's do doughnuts in the football field, huh?
Willow Oh, my God, look out!
Giles Ooo... Copper's got a gun!
Giles You'll never use it, though, man.
Officer Will so.
Joyce Ripper, be careful!
Giles Told him he'd never use it.
Joyce You are sooo cool. You're like Burt Reynolds.
Man Sorry! Gotta go!
Buffy Oh, God.
Buffy Are you guys okay?
Willow Is anybody else all creeped out and trembly?
Snyder Oh, Buffy... Your mom's gonna kill you.
Buffy Something's weird.
Oz Something's not?
Buffy No grownups.
Buffy No one's protecting their houses. Everyone's just... wandering.
Snyder Hey!
Snyder Hey, give it!
Willow Defenseless.
Buffy So where are all the vampires?
Buffy Soup's on, but no one's grabbing a spoon.
Oz Something's happening... someplace that's else.
Buffy I'd say something big.
Snyder That guy took my candy!
Buffy The candy. I-it's gotta be the candy! It's cursed.
Snyder A curse?! Oh, I've got a curse.
Willow God, using candy for evil!
Oz My parents ate a ton.
Buffy Who's behind it?
Snyder I don't know. It came through the school board. If you knew that crowd...
Buffy Where did it come from? Do you know where to get it?
Snyder Yeah.
Buffy You guys get Xander and Cordelia. Go to the library and look it up.
Oz Candy curses?
Willow Disturbing second childhood. Got it.
Buffy Ratboy and I are going to the source.
Buffy Mom? Giles?!
Giles Go away. We're busy.
Buffy Mom!
Joyce Hey!
Buffy Where did you get that coat? Never mind. Listen...
Giles Back off!
Buffy Giles, think about this. You wanna fight me, or you wanna let me talk to my mother?
Buffy Mom, look at me. Do you know who I am?
Joyce Of course. You're Buffy. Hey, look. They're, they're giving away candy. You want some candy?
Buffy No, I don't! And you don't need any more, either.
Joyce I'm fine. I can have more if I want.
Buffy You are *not* fine. You need to go home.
Joyce Screw you. I want candy!
Buffy Mom!
Joyce You wanna slay stuff, and *I'm* not allowed to do anything about it. Well, this is what *I* wanna do, so get off my back!
Buffy Mom, please, this is...
Giles Oh, for God's sake. Just let your mum have the sodding candy. C'mon, Joyce...
Buffy Mom, look at your car. Look at that dent the size of New Brunswick. I did that.
Joyce Oh, my God. What was I thinking when I bought the *Geek* Machine?
Buffy Listen to me. You need...
Giles No, you listen to me. I'm your Watcher, so you do what I tell you. Now, sod off!
Buffy Take her home.
Giles Joyce...
Buffy Mom!
Joyce Hey!
Giles Oy! You leave her alone!
Snyder Hey, Brit-face! Wait up!
Buffy Stay.
Snyder It smells so chocolatey.
Giles This is far out.
Ethan Yeah, I've been out there. Town's wide open. You guys can go anytime.
Buffy Ethan Rayne.
Ethan Might wanna hurry.
Giles Ethan.
Ethan Ripper.
Cordelia At first it was fun, you know? They seemed like they were in this really good moodnot like parentsand then...
Willow Badness?
Cordelia Mom started borrowing my clothes. There should be an age limit on lycra pants. And Dad, he just locked himself in the bathroom with old copies of Esquire.
Xander I don't get this. The candy's supposed to make you feel all immature and stuff, but I've had a ton, and I don't feel any dif...
Xander Never mind.
Willow I'll take that one.
Cordelia You wanna swap?
Willow What? Swap?
Cordelia You wanna swap? This book is really thick, and I'm not sure it's in English.
Giles Where... Bloody Hell!
Buffy That's what smoking will do to you. Now be quiet.
Giles Well... Where'd the bastard go?
Buffy Shh!
Giles What?
Buffy Look. A box full of farm-fresh chicken.
Joyce Do you suppose they're okay?
Snyder Mm-hm. So... are you two kinda... like, um... goin' steady?
Buffy So, Ethan, what are we playing? We're pretty much in a talk-or-bleed situation. Your call.
Giles Hit him.
Ethan I-I'd just like to point out that this wasn't my idea.
Buffy Meaning...?
Ethan I'm subcontracting. It's Trick you want. I'm just helping him collect a tribute... for a demon.
Giles He's lying. Hit him!
Buffy I don't think he is, and shut up.
Giles You're *my* Slayer, go knock his teeth down his thr...
Buffy Giles!
Buffy What demon?
Ethan I don't remember.
Giles Yes!
Ethan Lurconis. Demon named Lurconis. They wanted a way to get the tribute away from people.
Buffy So you're just Diversion Guy?
Ethan More than a diversion. Well, they said the tribute was big, so big that people would never let them take it. That people had to be out-of-it. And later on, when the candy wore off, they'd blame themselves.
Buffy Hence, land of the irresponsible. So, where's Trick?
Ethan I don't know exactly.
Giles Hit him again.
Ethan No! I-I-I really don't know. Delivering the tribute.
Buffy Which brings us to the bonus question, and believe me when I say a wrong answer will cost you *all* your points.
Buffy What's the tribute?
Buffy Right. Lurconis.
Willow Lurconis. A demon. What's his deal?
Buffy See if it says anything about a tribute.
Willow A tribute? Like what?
Buffy I don't know. My source is all tapped out.
Snyder She whupped you good, huh? Yah! Wah! I can do that. I took Tae Kwon Do at the Y.
Buffy No, no. It's definitely a demon. A big one.
Giles I wouldn't.
Buffy Giles, give me the gun.
Buffy Giles...
Buffy Now.
Joyce Uh, it's, um, it's Willow. She wants you real bad.
Buffy Uh-huh?
Willow Okay, Oz just found it. 'The tribute to Lurconis is made every thirty years.' I-it's a ritual feeding. A-and this one's late, so it's probably, you know, a big meal.
Willow Oh. And... Oh. Lurconis eats babies.
Buffy Come on.
Joyce Well, what about that man?
Buffy Uh, see if you guys can find something to tie him up with.
Joyce Um...
Buffy *Never* tell me.
Nurse I didn't see anything. I don't *know* where they are.
Joyce Something's gonna eat those babies?
Nurse What can *I* do?
Snyder I think that is so wrong.
Nurse Get off my back about it!
Giles She says she never saw who took them. Dozy cow.
Buffy I *know* who took them.
Giles Well, then let's do something. Let's find the demon and, and... kick the crap out of it.
Snyder Is that what happens now?
Buffy Yeah, if we knew where they were.
Giles 'Lurconis dwells beneath the city, filth to filth.'
Buffy What?
Giles Ooo! I know this. Uh... I knew this. 'Lurconis' means... 'glutton'. And we'll find it, um... in the sewers.
Joyce The sewers?
Snyder Uh, good. You go do that thing with the demon, and I'll stay here in case the babies, you know, uh... find their way back.
Joyce The babies must be so scared.
Giles You filthy little ponce. Are you afraid of a little demon?
Snyder If you want to splash around in the poo, you're the filthy one!
Buffy Okay, you know what? Everybody just stop it! Okay, listen to me. I need help, okay? Giles, I need grownups.
Buffy These children are gonna die if we don't act now, okay, and think clearly. There is no room for mistakes. Besides which... you guys are just wigging me out.
Giles Sorry.
Joyce We'll behave.
Buffy Good. Snyder, go home.
Snyder I can do that.
Buffy Giles, we're going to the sewers.
Buffy And don't do that!
Trick Come on, big guy. They're not getting any fresher.
Mayor_Wilkins Carol. Hi. Yeah. Call Dave on the public works committee tomorrow about sewer maintenance and repair. I have some concerns regarding exposed gas pipes, infrastructure, ventilation. And, uh... cancel my 3:00.
Buffy Hi.
Giles What the hell's that?
Buffy Lurconis, I'm thinking.
Trick Ordinarily, I like other people to do my fighting for me, but I just gotta see what you got.
Buffy Just tell me when it hurts.
Buffy Giles! No!
Trick You and me, girl. There's hard times ahead.
Buffy They never just leave. Always gotta say something.
Joyce Can we go home now?
Buffy Yeah, we can go home. I've got the SATs tomorrow.
Joyce Oh, blow them off. I'll write you a note.
Buffy No. It's okay.
Joyce Poor babies. Come on...
Mayor_Wilkins And your friend?
Trick Paid him. The man did his job. No reason to burn that bridge.
Mayor_Wilkins This didn't turn out the way I had planned.
Trick Where's the downside? You just got yourself one less demon you have to pay tribute to. The way I see it, I did you a favor.
Mayor_Wilkins I guess you did.
Mayor_Wilkins In the future... I'd be *very* careful how many favors you do for me.
Xander Hey, Snyder. Heard you had some fun Friday night. Have you come down yet?
Snyder That's 'Principal Snyder'.
Xander And that's a big 'yep'.
Snyder You look like four young people with too much time on your hands.
Oz Not really.
Cordelia Busy like a bee, actually. Bee-like!
Snyder Good. It seems we had some vandalism Friday on school property, and I was just looking for some... volunteers to help clean it up.
Willow 'Kiss rocks'? Why would anyone want to kiss... Oh, wait. I get it.
Snyder Let's get you some paint remover.
Buffy It was just too much to deal with. It was like nothing made sense anymore. The things that I thought I understood were gone. I just felt... so alone.
Giles Was that the math or the verbal?
Buffy Mostly the math.
Giles Well, if you scored low, then you can take them again.
Buffy More SATs? Is there really a point? I could die before I even apply to college.
Giles And then, you very possibly might not.
Buffy Well, let's just keep hope alive.
Giles Hello.
Joyce Hi.
Giles I say, your car seems to have had an adventure, doesn't it?
Joyce Uh, Buffy assures me that it happened battling evil, so I'm letting her pay for it on the installment plan.
Buffy Uh, hey, the way things were going, be glad that's the worst that happened. At least I got to the two of you before you actually *did* something.
Joyce Right.
Giles Indeed.
Joyce Y-yes.

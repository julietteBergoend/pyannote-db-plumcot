not_available You can't expect me to engage you in small talk just to make you feel better .
not_available You flunked the licensing test .
not_available Did you think I didn't know ?
not_available I didn't .
not_available You didn't apply yourself .
not_available You think this is something people do as a last resort and therefore it can't be that difficult .
not_available I feel bad .
not_available You wanna make it worse ?
not_available I don't care what you feel Bullshit .
not_available You like it when I feel bad because misery loves company .
not_available How'd he die ?
not_available Heart attack .
not_available Fell down a flight of stairs , dead when he hit the bottom .
not_available His nose supposed to look like that ?
not_available Of course not .
nate_fisher I have to finish embalming him before I can start on anything cosmetic .
not_available I can deal with whoever it is .
nate_fisher Unless it's a walk in .
not_available You are choosing to be the victim here .
not_available I could handle an intake
not_available and you know it .
not_available Ladies , teacup chain .
not_available Good .
not_available And walk to the middle and back .
not_available All right , very good .
not_available Very good , ladies and gentlemen .

david_fisher Hi .
not_available Goddamn it , why hasn't anyone answered the door ?
not_available Where is Mom ?
nate_fisher Okay , if you haven't slept with that guy yet , would you start ?
not_available Because I think it would do you a world of good .
not_available Don't do that .
ruth_fisher Do what ?
not_available Watch me like that .
not_available I can't help it .
not_available You're beautiful .
not_available Oh , for heaven's sake .
not_available I want to go camping again .
not_available Then go camping .
ruth_fisher With you .
not_available I've got a job now , Hiram .
not_available I can't just up and leave whenever I feel like it .
hiram_gunderson Spring is a very busy time of the year .
not_available It's our anniversary tomorrow .
not_available The first time we went camping was two years ago tomorrow .
ruth_fisher We don't have anniversaries .
not_available I never agreed to anniversaries .
not_available Just you and me alone in the woods .
not_available Naked under the stars .
not_available Just like it was at the beginning .
not_available Tomorrow is such short notice .
not_available I can't promise anything .
not_available But I'll try .
not_available My mom wants to know how quickly we can do this .
not_available Well , I'd suggest a viewing in two days to allow proper restoration .
not_available Viewing ?
not_available For friends , family .
vickie_dimas You can make it as small or as large as you wish .
not_available No , I can't see him in a box .
not_available I can't .
not_available All right .
not_available Ms .
not_available Dimas , seeing your son before you bury him might help you to let go .
not_available No , I don't want to see him !
david_fisher Of course .
not_available We'll arrange for a closed casket ceremony .
gabe_dimas Will three days give you enough time ?
not_available Yeah , that's gonna be fine .
not_available Nate will show you to the door .
not_available Thanks .
not_available What happened ?
not_available A 6year old found a gun and was playing with it .
not_available Oh , Jesus .
gabe_dimas Yeah .
not_available They gave me this at the hospital .
not_available It's some sort of receipt .
not_available I don't know I don't know if you need it , but What was he doing here ?
not_available Gabe .
not_available It's okay .
not_available Hey .
not_available My brother just told me .
not_available I'm so sorry .
not_available I didn't know where else to go .
not_available My grandmother's funeral was here .
not_available Yeah , of course .
not_available My mom's waiting for me to unlock the car .
not_available I thought we were supposed to encourage people to have a viewing .
not_available Well , sometimes people don't want that .
not_available Well , sometimes you don't want to work any harder .
not_available When faced with the option of not having to restore a child's head that's been blown to bits ,
not_available yeah , I don't want to do that .
not_available Do you ?
not_available We can't force someone to do something they're not ready to do because we think it's the right thing .
not_available Because it will make us feel better .
not_available Can I help you ?
not_available Roses are if you love somebody , right ?
man_in_flower_shop Roses are the classic choice , but other flowers could achieve the same effect .
man_in_flower_shop What if you were gonna ask her to marry you ?
not_available Oh , how lovely .
man_in_flower_shop Well , roses would be the perfect choice .
not_available But she turned out to be a cheating coward and ran off with some shithead that she met at traffic school .
not_available What color would you give a coward ?
not_available Yellow .
not_available Yellow .
not_available Great .
not_available Twelve dozen yellow roses sent to this address , please .
not_available What would you like the card to say ? "
not_available Fuck you , cunt .
not_available " I think it would be more personal if you write that .
not_available Yes .
not_available Yes .
not_available I have to take the day off tomorrow and Saturday .
not_available Why ?
not_available I was supposed to have plans with a friend
not_available and I forgot .
not_available Is it with that man ?
not_available The one with the funny little car that picks you up ?
not_available It's an electric car and it's very good for the environment .
not_available Why are you laughing ?
not_available Because you are not .
not_available You like this man ?
not_available Can I have the days off or not ?
not_available Take !
not_available Go , I don't care .
not_available We will miss you .
not_available Beep , beep .
not_available Beep , beep .
not_available Brenda ?
not_available Hey there .
not_available I'll be right out .
not_available I just got out of the shower .
not_available How was work ?
nate_fisher It sucked .
not_available Like I figured , I failed that funeral director's test .
not_available There was this intake meeting this morning
not_available I totally fucked up .
not_available And I just picked up a dead
not_available All in all , it's been a pretty bad day .
not_available Goddamn it !
nate_fisher Sometimes I feel like I don't have any fucking idea what I'm doing .
not_available It's like I made this bullshit decision to go into this business for all the wrong reasons
not_available and now it's too late .
not_available It's never too late .
not_available Jesus , Billy .
not_available What , do you live here now ?
not_available No , Brenda just gave me a shiatsu .
not_available I've been kind of tense lately .
not_available So Bad day ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Well , I've had my share of those .
brenda_chenowith Well , I don't doubt that .
not_available I don't really feel like cooking , so you guys decide what we're having delivered .
not_available That shit was all over the news .
not_available Six years old , right ?
not_available Fuck !
not_available Some people should just not be allowed to have kids .
not_available She just sat there like a ghost .
not_available Just like she'd been erased .
not_available I felt so fucking helpless .
not_available Oh , God .
billy_chenowith That poor woman .
not_available There's a tribe in Nigeria that throws a dead baby's body into the bush because they believe if buried the dead infant would offend the earth gods which bring fertility and food .
not_available The Chinese consider the death of a child a bad death .
not_available The parents and grandparents aren't expected to go to the funeral .
not_available Or the Balinese mother who's counseled to be cheerful after her infant's death because grief makes one vulnerable to illness and malevolent demons .
not_available Well , that was informative .
billy_chenowith Yeah , I thought it'd be good to read up on your boyfriend's line of work .
not_available What a man does is
not_available Well , it's who he is .
not_available Right , Nate ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available A man should know the history of his chosen profession if he expects to be anything but an amateur .
not_available So I'm an amateur .
not_available I prefer the term dilettante .
not_available And what are you , Billy ?
not_available Running around with your camera , taking pictures of people's lives ?
not_available Boys .
not_available You think knowing a bunch of arcane National Geographic shit is gonna help me cope with a 6year old who shot himself in the head ?
not_available There are plenty of places in the world where a kid dying is pretty common .
not_available But we can't deal with it , because a dead child is the greatest failure of a culture that believes it's reversed the order of nature .
not_available This was an accident .
not_available This wasn't nature .
not_available You know what I find interesting ?
not_available If you lose a spouse , you're called a widow or a widower .
not_available If you're a child and you lose your parents , then you're an orphan .
not_available But what's the word to describe a parent who loses a child ?
not_available I guess that's just too fucking awful to even have a name .
kurt I was worried you weren't gonna show .
not_available I just got tied up at work .
kurt Believe me , I need this after the day I had .
not_available This ought to help .
not_available Oh , what is it ?
not_available X. Ecstasy .
not_available You ever done it ?
not_available No , can't say that I have .
david_fisher You're gonna love it .
not_available Are you gonna take one too ?
not_available I'm already there .
not_available Let's dance .
not_available I'm not a very good dancer .
not_available You will be .
not_available David .
kurt David .
not_available Here , you gotta keep drinking this .
not_available She was only 63 .
not_available That's so young .
nate_fisher Isn't that young ?
grieving_woman Have you thought about what kind of funeral you'd like for your mother ?
grieving_woman It has to be beautiful .
nate_fisher It has to be beautiful .
not_available Well , we can offer you a wide variety of services ranging from simple to more formal to To anything you might need .
not_available Yes , anything at all .
not_available It's a good thing I was there , you know ?
not_available I mean , Gabe was so wrecked I was the one who had to trash his weed .
not_available Seriously , if the police found that shit , it'd be way worse , you know ?
not_available Hey , Andy .
not_available Hey .
not_available How's Gabe ?
not_available He's okay , I guess .
not_available Well , have you talked to him ?
not_available Not really .
not_available Well , are you gonna see him later ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available It's real weird over there .
claire_fisher The mother's , like , all freaked .
not_available Yeah , but what about Gabe ?
not_available Look , Morticia , I'm not interfering .
not_available It's too much to get into , you know ?
not_available I thought you were his friend .
not_available Why don't you fuck off , bitch ?
not_available If you're so worried , why don't you go fuck him again ?
not_available That'll cheer him up .
not_available Nice , that's nice .
not_available Yeah .
not_available By the way , Parker told me how one of your testicles is , like freakishly small , like a peanut .
not_available Is that true ?
not_available That's not true .
not_available For later .
not_available You have a headache , dear ?
not_available Yeah , I thought I did .
not_available I'm throwing in a load of laundry if you need some done .
ruth_fisher By the way , I'm going camping with Hiram this weekend .
not_available I'm leaving this afternoon .
not_available Great .
not_available I'm doing whites first .
not_available Fuck .
not_available David , David .
not_available David .
not_available David ?
not_available David !
not_available David ?
not_available Are you all right ?
not_available You look pale .
not_available No , I'm fine .
not_available It's just a headache , that's all .
not_available Okay , you're in this , like , total danger zone .
parker_mckenna Gabe Dimas is a dick .
not_available I'm sorry his brother's dead , but don't think that means he's not a dick .
parker_mckenna I just haven't seen him around , so I was worried .
claire_fisher If you hook up with him now , it's gonna be like total emotional rape .
parker_mckenna Whatever he feels for you is gonna be wrapped up in some guilt grief fuckfest .
not_available You better stay away from that shit .
not_available I'm not kidding .
not_available So you failed a test .
not_available Big whoop .
not_available You want to be helpful to the people that walk in through your door
not_available so you have to be one of those people .
not_available Okay .
not_available I chose three funeral homes from the yellow pages at random .
not_available I've always felt an uncontrolled sample group provides more reliable data .
not_available What , you want us to pretend to be purchasing a funeral ?
not_available Look up the first address .
brenda_chenowith I think it's in Sherman Oaks .
not_available Come on , it'll be fun .
not_available Hello ?
not_available Gabe ?
claire_fisher Is anybody home ?
not_available Oh , Mrs . Dimas , I'm sorry .
not_available The door was open .
not_available Is Gabe around ?
not_available We can still leave .
not_available Why ?
not_available What are you afraid of ?
not_available Humiliating myself , wasting someone's valuable time .
not_available Don't be so left brained .
not_available I'm so sorry to keep you waiting .
not_available Now , how can I help ?
not_available It's my parents .
not_available They were killed this morning in an accident .
not_available I'm terribly sorry .
not_available It was a A helicopter went down
not_available and there was an explosion .
not_available Oh , God .
not_available I can't do this .
not_available It's not right .
not_available They were in the prime of their lives .
not_available Everybody dies .
not_available We all die .
not_available Everything we ever care about will disappear .
not_available So , what's the fucking point of living ?
not_available Can I suggest matching caskets ?
not_available That's it ?
not_available That's what you have to offer me in my time of grief ?
brenda_chenowith Merchandise ?
not_available We have nothing to learn here .
not_available Water purifier .
not_available Rope .
not_available Bear bell .
not_available Flashlight .
not_available Toilet paper .
not_available And , yes , it's biodegradable .
not_available Bird caller .
not_available Binoculars .
hiram_gunderson I'm sure you have everything .
not_available I know you have everything .
not_available You always do .
not_available It wouldn't be fun to get up there and realize we forgot the matches , would it ?
not_available Or the champagne .
not_available Hiram , that's just decadent .
not_available Was it expensive ?
not_available We shouldn't waste it .
not_available Waste it ?
not_available It's our anniversary .
not_available Claire , you're home early .
not_available You remember Hiram .

not_available and I'll be back tomorrow .
not_available It's a very beautiful time of the year .
not_available Okay .
not_available Well , you two have fun .
not_available We should probably leave if we want to beat the rush hour traffic .
not_available Ruth ?
not_available Honey , what's wrong ?
not_available My children don't need me anymore .
not_available Let's think of this as a celebration of your uncle's life .
not_available Now , the Titan is an excellent choice for a distinguished gentleman .
not_available It's solid mahogany .
not_available It's hand finished .
not_available Burlwood and nickel accents .
not_available And Grace Field Grace Field is a lovely place for interment .
not_available It's serene .
not_available It's pastoral .
not_available How much ?
not_available Well , after you sign the contract , we take care of everything .
not_available There's no worry .
not_available There's no pain .
slick_funeral_director How much ?
nate_fisher It comes to just under $20,000 .
not_available You're charging $ 12,000 for the Titan ?
not_available What is that , like a 300 percent markup ?
not_available I could come down to 10 .
not_available And Grace Field is in between a power station and a freeway .
not_available There are nicer cemeteries .
not_available But they're just a little bit more expensive .
nate_fisher No , thanks .
not_available We'll try and find somewhere that doesn't just want to swindle us .
not_available Nice tie .
not_available This business is a total racket .
nate_fisher What business isn't ?
not_available You know , sometimes I wish I could be this completely selfish asshole that didn't give a shit about anything
brenda_chenowith and I could just work at some mindless job that paid me a fuckload of money .
not_available No , you don't .
not_available It would make my life a lot easier .
not_available You don't want your life to be easy .
not_available Gabe ?
not_available Hi .
claire_fisher I didn't know if anybody was home .
gabe_dimas Did you ring the bell ?
not_available I just I came by to drop off this stuff .
not_available Okay .
gabe_dimas It's my brother's soccer clothes .
gabe_dimas I thought that he might like to get buried in them .
not_available You think that's okay ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Yeah , I think that's really nice .
gabe_dimas I went to your house .
not_available You see my mom ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Just like a zombie .
not_available Just sits there .
not_available I don't know why she blames herself .
not_available It's my fault .
not_available I killed him .
claire_fisher Gabe , no .
not_available It was an accident .
not_available It wouldn't have happened if I'd been watching him .
not_available My mom can't even find Anthony's dad to tell him what happened .
not_available Probably moved .
not_available We haven't seen him in , like , two years .
not_available Oh , that sucks .
not_available He's a fucking drunken dipshit .
not_available He used to kick my ass just to prove he could .
not_available You know when people would call you those things like " cemetery girl " and " Vampira " ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available I never thought that was funny .
not_available I should go .
not_available Would you just make sure your brother gets these ?
not_available Of course .
not_available Hey , look .
not_available If you need anything , like to talk or something , you can call me .
not_available All right .
not_available Where do you want to hang the food ?
not_available Can't it wait till after dinner ?
not_available I've already taken out what we're going to eat .
not_available I'd rather not risk it .
not_available I'm sorry it's inconvenient
not_available but would you prefer we were mauled in our sleep by bears ?
hiram_gunderson Ruth ?
not_available You need to relax .
not_available Hello , I'm Rosemary .
not_available How can I help you ?
not_available Hi .
not_available I need to make arrangements for a funeral .
not_available All right .
nate_fisher My wife's in the restroom .
rosemary She'll be out in a minute .
not_available Can I ask who the funeral is for ?
not_available It's for me .
not_available Bet you don't get too many people shopping for their own funeral .
not_available It happens .
not_available Most people who know they're going to die want to have a say .
not_available Planning it with your husband could be a meaningful process for you both .
not_available Is it cancer ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available It's everywhere .
not_available Liver now .
not_available Brenda .
brenda_chenowith My husband hates me doing this .
not_available He wants me to spend this time doing things I always dreamed of but never gave myself permission to Pardon me .
not_available The coughing blood and pissing needles thing kind of gets in the way .
not_available He just wants you to be happy .
not_available He just doesn't want me to die .
not_available Okay , it's just too fucked up , Brenda .
not_available I can't do it .
not_available I can't .
rosemary He's not ready .
not_available It's hard for him .
not_available Probably harder than it is for you .
not_available That was the most fucked up thing you've ever done to me .
not_available Sorry .
nate_fisher That was like the shit you pulled on those doctors to get a rise out of them .
not_available Are you gonna start barking at me ?
not_available I might .
not_available What you did just now was not funny !
brenda_chenowith Well , it wasn't meant to be .
not_available You counsel people about death every day , Nate when death is what you're most afraid of .
not_available What's wrong with this picture ?
not_available Of course I'm afraid of it .
not_available What sane person isn't ?

claire_fisher Claire , I really need that aspirin bottle .
not_available David , I really don't have it .
not_available What was in there ?
not_available He gave me some pills .
not_available Now I'll have to say , " Sorry , I lost them because I'm this old guy geek
not_available and I'm completely uncool in this world in which you seem to thrive you perfect distillation of human evolution .
claire_fisher "
claire_fisher Okay , is this split personality thing like , something that happens when Mom goes out of town ?
not_available Because I like you like this way better .
not_available Dinner was delicious .
not_available Food just tastes better outdoors .
not_available Remember what we ate the first time we went camping ?
not_available No .
not_available Pork chops with fire roasted vegetables .
not_available Oh , yes .
not_available The sky was so clear that night .
ruth_fisher Just like tonight .
not_available Did you know you're not supposed to go camping if you're menstruating ?

not_available My husband buried a young woman once .
not_available She went on a camping trip .
ruth_fisher She was menstruating .
not_available A bear smelled the blood and killed her in her sleeping bag .
ruth_fisher Killed one of her friends too .

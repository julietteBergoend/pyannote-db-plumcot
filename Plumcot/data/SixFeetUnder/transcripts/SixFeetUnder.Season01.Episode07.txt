not_available It's not exactly the Holiday Inn , as you can see .
not_available Mostly , mostly , um , we're filling sandbags and cleaning vehicle filters .
not_available This particular war , it's really important to keep the mechanisms clean , because of all the sand , which can be as much of a threat as any missile that Sadaam can send .
not_available Captain Summers saysI
not_available can?t say much , but pretty soon , we're gonna get into the real action , andand we're prepared , I'll tell ya .
not_available You guys , do you mind , please ?
not_available I'm sending something to my folks .

not_available Damn it !
not_available Sorry , Mom .
not_available Listen , some of these guys are kind of crazy , but they're good soldiers .
not_available I'm getting a lot of responsibility here .
not_available I think it's been very beneficial in terms of personal leadership skills and getting a job
not_available A lot more than had I stayed at home .
not_available Well , I've got a lot to do before lights out , so until next time , this is Private First Class Victor Kovitch , signing off .
not_available Hey , buddy , brought you the latest " South Park " . "
not_available  Fuck , David !
not_available Hey , sleepyhead !
not_available You know , I had the weirdest dream .
not_available Really ?
not_available This guy comes into my house at like 4 AM , he climbs into my bed , but instead of having his way with me , he just passes out , and all night long , he keeps jerking .
not_available That is weird .
not_available And he talked in his sleep .
not_available Yeah , what did he say ?
not_available It was completely unintelligible , but angry .
not_available Oh .
not_available There was even teeth grinding .
not_available Well that explains the headaches .
not_available I was thinking that exposure to formaldehyde might give me a brain tumor .
not_available Hey , would you like some caffeine with that tumor ?
not_available OK .
not_available David , I can't .
not_available Why not ?
not_available Because last night I drove Mr .
not_available Sanopoulous' body all the way to San Jose,then straight back .
not_available I barely got four hours sleep and , frankly , I'm getting tired of always getting the shitty jobs you don't want .
not_available I'm half owner of this business .
not_available You can't legally do intake without me .
not_available You're not a licensed funeral director .
not_available I'm getting my license next month .
not_available If you pass the test .
not_available Hey , thanks for the vote of confidence , and how am I supposed to study for that test with only like four hours sleep a night ?
not_available Coffee and diet pills worked for me .
not_available Nate , I can't pick her up .
not_available I've got a deacons' meeting , and Rico's got Vanessa's ultrasound .
not_available Shit , you know , the last time I had to pick somebody up at a nursing home , nobody'd even told the roommate she was dead .
not_available I had to .
not_available Just be thankful we've got the business .
not_available Thankful I'm not you .
not_available What ?
not_available Oh , Mr . Sanopoulous .
not_available Sorry .
not_available Fuck !
not_available I smell like a dead guy !
not_available No , you smell fine .
not_available Your life stinks , you complain all the time , and that's really dull .
not_available Didn't realize I was boring you .
not_available Nate , you need to take a break .
not_available Some major stress release that's not me .
not_available It's too much responsibility .
not_available I thought you liked being an undertaker's girlfriend .
not_available Is that what I am to you ?
not_available Your girlfriend ?
not_available Well , I like to think of you as my mistress .
not_available Well , then , you'd better start buyin' me a lot more shit,Mistah !
not_available God , I love you .
not_available OK , I said it .
not_available Let's just move on .

not_available Yeah , we'll sit in the hot mud
not_available , we'll get massages , we'll eat like pigs , we'll drink a lot .
not_available If we leave Friday night , we could be naked for two whole days .
not_available I got three clients this Saturday .
not_available Postpone , cancel , lie .
not_available Come on , we've never taken a trip together .
not_available We need to do this !
not_available Two whole days ?
not_available What if we drive each other crazy ?
not_available Well , we don't !
not_available Hovering .
not_available Claire , I've invited a friend of mine over for dinner tonight .
not_available OK .
not_available And I want you to be nice to him .
not_available Is this the guy ?
not_available The guy that , uh Yes .
not_available OK .
not_available Thanks for your patience , everybody .
not_available I know we're running late .
not_available By the way , I spoke to Father Clark this morning .
not_available He's holding up well .
not_available He says you folks are the most thorough search committee he has ever encountered .
not_available David , I understand you're the last to meet with him .
not_available This afternoon .
not_available Good .
not_available We've been interviewing associate priests for three months .
not_available It'll be nice to have an open mind .
not_available Clark struck me as a player , a man of God , wants to listen , but there's ego there .
not_available You didn't want Jack .
not_available Connie , you say that so easily , and you know it's not true .
not_available I've never seen you so desperate .
not_available Listen , you folks have to represent the whole congregation , and , believe me , if Clark's not right , I'm ready to start over from the beginning .
not_available Let's vote right now .
not_available You know him , David , he's been a visiting rector .
not_available You've got his resume .
not_available All the deacons are here .
not_available There's no reason why you can't vote now .
not_available I'll be happy to leave the room .
not_available No , I want to meet with Father Clark myself
not_available so I can make the most informed decision .
not_available This how it works , Jack ?
not_available You bring in the new generation deacon , the new deacon brings in the radical priest you want .
not_available I can assure you , there?'s no agenda here , Mr . Kriegenthaler .
not_available Except yours .
not_available Don't worry , Dave .
not_available I had a parish in Ohio where punches got thrown .
not_available Steel workers .
not_available St .
not_available Bart's doesn't even come close .
not_available Actually , David , your father was against Jack here , and , as I said at the time , your father was wrong .
not_available Wow !
not_available Shit !
not_available Fuck !
not_available Billy !
not_available Fuck you !
not_available I've seen pictures of this on the internet , but The rule is , you call before you come over , OK ?
not_available I know .
not_available I'm sorry !
not_available I was biking down the boardwalk .
not_available I didn't have my cell phone on me .
not_available Good morning , Nate .
not_available Bill .
not_available Oh , Bren , I got some fucking amazing shots of these hookers on Sunset
not_available I wanna show you .
not_available Real human tragedy shit .
not_available I think they're really good .
not_available Well , your mom walked in on us once .
not_available So I guess now we're even .
not_available This chick has seen the fucking worst life has to offer .
not_available Jesus , Billy , these are incredible .
not_available And what is that thing on her neck ?
not_available She's got like this big tumor , and she's still turning tricks .
not_available And you just know there is some freak for whom that is a big turn on .
not_available I love the Bank of America in the background .
not_available Well , I have to go to work .
not_available Bring out your dead !
not_available hey're great .
not_available Don't forget .
not_available ancel those appointments on Saturday .
not_available See you later .

not_available Saturday ?
not_available We're going to California Cactus World out on Rosemary Boulevard .
not_available i want to get something really weird to plant out back .
not_available Yo , Dave !
not_available In here !
not_available Sorry , there was an accident on the 405 .
not_available Both cars totaled .
not_available Should have stopped to hand out cards .
not_available This is Paul Kovitch .
not_available His brother , Victor , just passed away .
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available This is my brother , Nate .
not_available Paul Kovitch ?
not_available You went to Balventure High .
not_available Yeah .
not_available I was there when you pinned that huge guy from Eurekaand won the State Wrestling Championship .
not_available You're the man !
not_available Me and my friend were so jealous 'cause we all knew how much you were getting laid .
not_available You wrestle ?
not_available No , played a little baseball , but we always lost
not_available So what are you doing now ?
not_available Oh , run Kovitch Checking up in Camrio .
not_available Wise .
not_available You know how expensive you can be ?
not_available No Paul and I were just going over the options for his brother's funeral .
not_available OK , I run a business , too .
not_available Let's just get right to it .
not_available Of course .
not_available I've buried both my parents , and , no offense , but I hate you guys .
not_available I hate what you do .
not_available The whole thing of " Let's all gather and look at this plastic dead version of our loved one .
not_available " It's really twisted .
not_available I want Victor cremated .
not_available No coffin .
not_available Put him in one of those cardboard boxes you charge $100 for .
not_available I'll take him up to where our mother's buried up in Tahatchapi and let his ashes blow away .
not_available I see Victor's a veteran .
not_available If you'd like , we can research any death benefits he might
not_available No .
not_available We hated the army .
not_available Me and him been fighting the army for seven years .
not_available His unit cleaned up the place called Bunker 73 in the Iraqi desert .
not_available chemicals all over .
not_available Sadaam's stuff we blew up .
not_available Soon as he came back , he got sick .
not_available Lung cancer at the age of 29 .
not_available Never smoked a day in his life .
not_available Still , no one would say the word , " Gulf War Syndrome . "
not_available He just wasted away , lying in that hospital .
not_available So , fuck the army .
not_available Let 'em keep their fucking money .
not_available I've gotta fly up to Idaho Falls , tell my stepfather .
not_available He?s got Alzheimer's .
not_available I don't know if he'll hear me or not .
not_available You're absolutely sure you wouldn't like the opportunity to say goodbye to Victor before I already said goodbye .
not_available Just do it ?
not_available And as for a receptacle for his remains ?
not_available A paper sack oughtta do just fine .
not_available Well , he obviously doesn't know about the Poseidon Society , or that's 900
not_available we'd be out of .
not_available That guy was the shit when I was in high school .
not_available You know , I never even knew he had a brother .
not_available It's time you introduced yourself .
not_available He's at the VA hospital .
not_available Alright ,
not_available but first , I just gotta talk to you about something .
not_available Nate , it's out of the question .
not_available I cannot spare you .
not_available We have three bodies right now .
not_available What is the problem ?
not_available Mr .
not_available Jacobson's going into the ground tomorrow,and Vic Kovitch will be toast by this weekend .
not_available What if we get another body ?
not_available Or two ?
not_available We cannot afford to turn down business .
not_available No , I'm sorry .
not_available I don't need your permission .
not_available Do you know how long it's been since I've had two days off ?
not_available Well , you see , here's the
difference You're willing to live like that .
not_available I'm not .
not_available I've invited my friend , Hiram Gunderson , over to dinner tonight .
not_available You're welcome to join us .
not_available Wouldn't a restaurant be better ?
not_available This is our home .
not_available This is my home !
not_available Oh , the camping guy !
not_available OK .
not_available Can I bring Brenda ?
not_available Hiram will be cooking .
not_available He spent 17 years as the top chef in Chicago .
not_available The food critic of The Sun Times called him the " father of the new rustic cuisine . "
not_available And then he gave it all up to become a hairdresser .
not_available And he has never been happier !
not_available You're multiplying differing variables .
not_available So ?
not_available You have to simplify !
not_available OK ?
not_available And then finally oops !
not_available look at that !
not_available Same variable , OK ?
not_available 4 and 4 gives us what ?
not_available And finally these two binomials right here are exactly the same ,
not_available so we
not_available what ?
not_available Combine !
not_available OK ?
not_available Any questions ?
not_available Claire Fisher !
not_available What ?
not_available Can you explain this formula to the class ?
not_available Not really .
not_available Well , maybe if you paid attention in class instead of reading .
not_available Well , maybe if you talked about something that was actually gonna be useful to me
not_available I would .
not_available Oh , algebra is useless ?
not_available Mmm .
not_available Know a lot of physicists who'd beg to differ .
not_available Well , I don't want to be a physicist .
not_available Algebra forces your mind to solve problems logically .
not_available It's one of the only perfect sciences You think the world runs on logic ?
not_available Come on .
not_available Open your eyes .
not_available OK , I'll see you after class , Miss Fisher .
not_available What are you doing ?
not_available let's try this next one , and I'm gonna make this a little tougher .
not_available X to the a power , times y to the b power .
not_available OK , now we've got to
not_available Of course we have catalogues for wedding package , but you have to come in and look .
not_available I can't show you over the phone .
not_available Website ?
not_available Not website .
not_available We don't have website !
not_available Mister , you have to come into my shop , and look at my work .
not_available Website !
not_available Ah !
not_available The day just got brighter !
not_available Hush !
not_available So who's dead now , and what do you need ?
not_available Well , nobody's dead .
not_available I came to return these vases .
not_available You should recycle them .
not_available Save a little money .
not_available So thoughtful !
not_available I am touched !
not_available Well , don't be silly !
not_available It's wasteful , that's all .
not_available Here .
not_available You still have that sign in the window .
not_available Yes .
not_available You know somebody good ?
not_available I do .
not_available Me .
not_available You ?
not_available I am interested .
not_available Let's talk .
not_available Robby , I'm going to lunch .
not_available I'm not going to lunch with you , Nikolai .
not_available I'm seeing someone .
not_available So what ?
not_available This is business .
not_available I hope so , because , otherwise , I withdraw my offer .
not_available Tell me .
not_available Why I should hire you ?
not_available I've been working with people for over 30 years
not_available and I know how to treat them with respect .
not_available I respect people , too .
not_available You're pompous and arrogant , and you're full of yourself .
not_available You act like the customer needs you .
not_available Of course the customer needs me !
not_available I have what he wants !
not_available You'll never build a business that way !
not_available I'm better with people , and I know about flowers .
not_available And if you don't think so , you can fire me .
not_available Fire you ?
not_available How I can fire you ?
not_available You don't even work here yet !
not_available My parish in New Mexico , I think they were afraid of me .
not_available They recommend you highly .
not_available They always do after I'm gone .
not_available I won't lie to you , David .
not_available I'll push for some change at St .
not_available Bart's .
not_available This is one of those congregations that thinks that sitting through church once a week absolves them of all moral responsibility , and they ignore the plight of others .
not_available But , don't get me wrong , they're good people .
not_available They're just lazy .
not_available I don't think that's entirely fair , Clark .
not_available We have a homeless outreach .
not_available You know you're the swing vote .
not_available I've been a deacon three weeks .
not_available I'm still getting used to how political the whole thing is .
not_available Well , religion is politics , David .
not_available Jesus was a revolutionary , threatened those in power , and they had him assassinated .
not_available And they'd do the same thing to him today .
not_available I'm not sure how much luck you'll have to get St .
not_available Bart's to stage a coup .
not_available The last thing that God wants from us is complacency .
not_available Maybe you should be in the Peace Corps .
not_available Already done it .
not_available Three years in Nicaragua , fresh out of Divinity School .
not_available That's where I lost my wife .
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available The hardest part about my work is the fact that most people don't want a real relationship with God .
not_available Yeah , sure , they'll pray to a man nailed to a cross , but they'll they'll ignore the gay kid who gets strung up , or the black man who gets dragged behind a car , or someone's mother living in a box .
not_available Were you this forthcoming with the other deacons ?
not_available Hardly .
not_available What did you and Walter Kriegenthaler talk about ?
not_available Golf .
not_available So , why did you decide to be so honest with me ?
not_available Because I can tell that right and wrong actually matter to you .
not_available This thing is fucking medieval .
not_available We've gotta get it fixed before somebody loses a finger .
not_available Never cared until it was your finger .
not_available Rico , a little help ?
not_available Why should I ?
not_available You know , it's because of you
not_available I'm going to be working double shifts this weekend .
not_available OK , that's just David being dramatic .
not_available We need to get at least two new bodies for that to be necessary .
not_available They come in bigger numbers than that .
not_available Just forget it .
not_available I know the score .
not_available It's never gonna be Fisher &amp ; Sons &amp ;
not_available Diaz .
not_available I know that .
not_available Let's see what we got .
not_available This one's a direct cremation .
not_available Nothing for you .
not_available Oh , fuck !
not_available What is that ?
not_available Shouldn't just burn people like they're garbage .
not_available What the Look , it came with fries .
not_available Now , look at this .
not_available Doesn't even look like the same guy , does it ?
not_available It says he applied to be buried at the National Cemetary .
not_available Signed a request for a flag fold , military escort
not_available Oh , man !
not_available Then you can't burn him .
not_available I can make him look like that again .
not_available Or almost .
not_available You could ace algebra , Claire , and we both know it .
not_available Power rests in the kind of knowledge one holds , so what's the use of knowing something that's useless ?
not_available Don't quote Castenada at me .
not_available Why not ?
not_available You quote Bob Dylan at me .
not_available You need algebra for college .
not_available You're just assuming I'm going to college .
not_available I know you're taking the PSAT tomorrow afternoon .
not_available It means you're thinking about it .
not_available Is that the only option ?
not_available Go to college , get a job so you could be a good consumer until you drop dead of exhaustion ?
not_available I don't want that .
not_available So what do you want ?
not_available I just want something to matter .
not_available Maybe I should wander around the desert and eat peyote and see God .
not_available Yeah , be a homeless drug addict .
not_available You'd get bored with that pretty fast .
not_available Hey , have you heard of the Sierra Crossroads Program ?
not_available What is that ?
not_available Like , " Bungee Jumping for Jesus " ?
not_available No , no , it's not affiliated with any religion .
not_available It's actually a really great program .
not_available I spent a couple of years there as an instructor .
not_available I think you might really like it .
not_available Why ?
not_available Because it would take you out of yourself , out of your head .
not_available Now , I'll warn you , it's hard , but exhilarating .
not_available I think it might just give you the challenge you're looking for .
not_available There's an expedition going out over spring break .
not_available I could pull some strings , see if I could get you in .
not_available Why do you care what happens to me ?
not_available Because I like you , and I want to see good things happen for you , and I know they can .
not_available We're here to dig his service records out of St . Louis .
not_available Then there's the big question of whether his cancer was service related .
not_available That means finding a doctor who thinks he was , and it took me four months to get all the approvals , but it means a burial allowance of up to 1500 from the VA .
not_available Might as well take that stuff , too .
not_available I packed it up for him .
not_available It's too bad nobody told his brother what he wanted .
not_available I did .
not_available Oh ,
not_available yeah .
not_available I gave Paul the forms .
not_available I found them later in the trash .
not_available Well , it's mostly someone else's writing on the forms .
not_available It doesn't match Victor's signature at all .
not_available I filled them out for him .
not_available He tried to do it himself , but those boxes are pretty small , and he shook a lot .
not_available Gulf War Victory Parade ?
not_available Victor said marching in it was the proudest moment of his life .
not_available Now , why would he keep it and watch it over and over if he hated the army ?
not_available Did Paul visit him much ?
not_available Oh , yeah .
not_available He was really good about it .
not_available So how come he
not_available He couldn't .
not_available Paul would say , " The fuckin' army stole your life , Vic, " and Vic would keep his mouth shut .
not_available I can tell you this , Victor wanted to believe that what he did in the Gulf meant something,that his life was not a waste .
not_available But , hey , I only counsel the veteran .
not_available I'm not supposed to interfere with what the family wants .
not_available So you taped his medals onto his chest , fished his files out of the trash , and passed them onto me ?
not_available Well , you can always blow it off .
not_available I mean , you didn't even know the guy , right ?
not_available What are you doing ?
not_available There was a form that said he was getting a military funeral .
not_available Who authorized this ?
not_available Nate ?
not_available Uh yeah .
not_available Goddamn it , how many times have I told you when Nate gives you instructions , you are to check with me first ?
not_available Turn him off .
not_available I'll drive him to the crematorium right now .
not_available Do I have to do it myself ?
not_available Fuckin
not_available ' Nate !
not_available Paul Kovitch is who our contract is with , and if he finds out about this , he will either sue us or break our legs .
not_available Wow !
not_available Uh , look who's here !
not_available Hello , Mrs .
not_available Fisher .
not_available Hello , dear .
not_available Hello , I'm Brenda .
not_available Hiram Gunderson .
not_available I understand you like to camp .
not_available Why , yes I do !
not_available I wish I could tell you where Nate was , but I have no idea .
not_available That's OK .
not_available I can exist without him .
not_available Toss some sesame seeds in the salad ?
not_available Yes , that would be lovely !
not_available There's my little girl .
not_available Claire , honey , this is Hiram Gunderson .
not_available Pleasure to meet you , Claire .
not_available hi
not_available This is delicious , Mrs .
not_available Fisher .
not_available Hiram is a chef .
not_available Oh .
not_available I can't get enough of his cock !
not_available Oh , Mom , I need $1200
not_available so I can go to Sierra Crossroads over spring break , and I need you to like sign this form like in case
not_available I die or something .
not_available Is this a school trip ?
not_available No , you go to the mountains and confront fear and get in touch with your most basic self .
not_available It looks good on your college application .
not_available Sorry I'm late .
not_available There was this major accident on the Long Beach Freeway .
not_available You always seem to get the bad traffic .
not_available Yeah .
not_available Hi , I'm Nate .
not_available Hiram .
not_available I've heard a lot about you .
not_available Don't believe a word of it .
not_available Hey , I'm sorry .
not_available Don't be .
not_available I'm having fun .
not_available So what did I miss ?
not_available I wanna go to Sierra Crossroads .
not_available We'll talk about it later , Claire .
not_available Oh , Mom , you should let her go .
not_available Crossroads is great .
not_available You went ?
not_available Yeah , we went kyacking down the Colorado River the summer
not_available I was what ?
not_available I don't think you were even born yet .
not_available I don't remember this .
not_available Ah , that's because I lied to you and Dad .
not_available I know Dad'd never let me go ,
not_available so I told you I was going to Sacramento to witness state government in action .
not_available Oh , by the way , everyone , I got a job .
not_available Cool .
not_available I'll be working at Nikolai's Flower Shop .
not_available I start tomorrow .
not_available It's just part time .
not_available You didn't tell me about that .
not_available Didn't I ?
not_available Need some help ?
not_available Incidentally , Nate , I dropped Victor Kovitch off at the Oak Valley Crematory .
not_available I need you to pick him up first thing tomorrow .
not_available Oh , fuck , David .
not_available He wanted a military funeral .
not_available He filled out the forms .
not_available Is he paying our bill ?
not_available You were there with his brother .
not_available It was clear he did not want the body embalmed .
not_available He could sue us , and we wouldn't have a case .
not_available OK , you know what , when you talk to me like this , it makes me want to not listen to a word you say .
not_available You and I could lose everything .
not_available Mom could lose her home .
not_available You know , Vic is eligible for a much bigger burial allowance from the VA than we thought .
not_available Really ?
not_available I'm leaving .
not_available I'll walk you down .
not_available Bye , David .
not_available Bye .
not_available Why don't you come over ?
not_available Spend the night ?
not_available I can't .
not_available I've gotta be in Pasadena tomorrow morning , and it'd add an extra hour to my trip .
not_available OK .
not_available Give me five minutes /I'll follow you .
not_available Tonight wasn't so bad , was it ?
not_available I suppose not .
not_available I don't know why I was so nervous .
not_available I mean , for heavens sake , I gave birth to those people !
not_available You know what occurred to me tonight
not_available that's really strange ?
not_available I wish you'd known my husband .
not_available I think the two of you would have liked each other .
not_available Who would get me a gift basket ?
not_available It's probably some Hollywood bigwig you work on who secretly wants to sleep with you .
not_available Oh , it's from my brother , and it is addressed to both of us .
not_available "
not_available Sorry about this morning .
not_available Have fun at Cactus World
not_available " Who knows ?
not_available Well , this is nice .
not_available We could take it with us on the weekend .
not_available I cannot wait to get out of here .
not_available I'm in dire need of some serious relaxation .
not_available Oh , fabulous !
not_available Smoked oysters .
not_available Really ?
not_available Is there any caviar ?
not_available No , but there are condoms , and ok edible underpants .
not_available That's a little scary .
not_available I'd say this whole thing is a little scary .
not_available No , it just means he likes you .
not_available Believe me , there were guys Billy didn't like .
not_available It's much better this way .
not_available I've been meaning to ask you .
not_available What's up with those matching tattoos you two have ?
not_available We're in Vegas .
not_available We were very drunk , and. .
not_available oh dear !
not_available These things always struck me as kind of ridiculous .
not_available Would you just stop that ?
not_available What does he think we're gonna do with this ?
not_available Brenda , this is like hostile !
not_available Look , Billy is bipolar .
not_available He's medicated .
not_available Sense of what's appropriate can be a little off at times .
not_available Look , you have no idea what he's been through .
not_available Don't judge him Please .
not_available Alright .
not_available Alright .
not_available You're never gonna work your way out of this one , soldier .
not_available I was nowhere near the latrine , sir , I promise .
not_available Give it up , private !
not_available Your ass is busted !
not_available Yeah , you're in big trouble !
not_available But my father's on the Joint Chief of Staff !
not_available Well , maybe we can't court martial you , but there is something else we can do .
not_available Come on , private !
not_available Yeah !
not_available You love that , don't you ?
not_available Hello ?
not_available David ?
not_available Walter Kriegenthaler .
not_available Did you meet with Father Clark ?
not_available Yes , today .
not_available We'd like to meet at 9:30 tomorrow .
not_available Can you make it ?
not_available Absolutely .
not_available And let me ask you a question , David .
not_available Do you think Clark is gay ?
not_available Uh I don't think so .
not_available He mentioned something about having a deceased wife .
not_available I mean , I don't care if he is .
not_available I just don't want him to push that agenda , you know ?
not_available Marriage , that whole thing .
not_available I have a cousin in DC whose church split because of that .
not_available Literally half the congregation left , and I don't want to see that happen to St .
not_available Bart's .
not_available I've been going there for 40 years .
not_available Well , it's late .
not_available I'll see you tomorrow morning .
not_available Good night .
not_available OK I got Victor , but I called the National Cemetary from the car , and , you know
not_available what?/ They can bury an urn .
not_available They call it " in urn, " and we could do it today at 3 .
not_available Why are you so determined to sabotage our business ?
not_available I don't think Paul ever knew how his brother ever really felt .
not_available Nate , why do you even care ?
not_available Because it's what Victor wanted , and he deserves it .
not_available He'd get a raw fuckin' deal , I'm telling you .
not_available Victor Kovitch did not hate the army .
not_available You just watch these tapes he made in the Gulf .
not_available Yes , sir , fuck me , sergeant !
not_available Oh , fuck ,
not_available yeah !
not_available Give it to me !
not_available Take it !
not_available Oh , come on , come on , it's funny .
not_available I have someplace I have to be .
not_available Dave , Dave , it's OK .
not_available I watch porn too !
not_available So , you guys taking the PSAT this afternoon too ?
not_available Uh yeah .
not_available What happens to you guys ?
not_available I go to UC Irvine and Northwestern Law , meet a totally great guy .
not_available He's a tri athlete .
not_available We get married , and I practice law for 8 years , and we get really rich , and then I have 2 great kids .
not_available So , you're , like , unbelievably happy .
not_available Kind of .
not_available I get a Masters in French , and then live in Paris for 6 months and hate it
not_available So I come back , become a TV development executive , and I work out all the time I'm fairly miserable and have a slight substance abuse problem .
not_available But you look great .
not_available Thanks .
not_available I start an interior lighting design firm with my college roommate , and it totally takes off .
not_available And then I die of ovarian cancer before I'm 30 .
not_available Oh , that sucks .
not_available Tell me about it .
not_available Well , good luck .
not_available What a freak !
not_available Father Jack ?
not_available David !
not_available Come in , sit .
not_available And call me Jack .
not_available We're beyond that .
not_available Meeting over already ?
not_available Yes .
not_available Damn .
not_available We all admire Clark's energy , but there is some concern that he may end up being divisive .
not_available As you said yourself , if we have to go back and start from the beginning And find some conservative lapdog who won't challenge anybody ?
not_available Yeah , that's what we need here .
not_available Scotch ?
not_available No , thank you .
not_available Clark thought he came on a little too strong with you .
not_available I liked him , Jack .
not_available I think the world would be a better place if there were more men like him .
not_available I just don't think that he's a good fit for St .
not_available Bart?s .
not_available Do you really think that Father Clark would be happy here ?
not_available Why should he be happy ?
not_available How happy are you ?
not_available You're right .
not_available I'm not happy .
not_available My life is very complicated and confusing .
not_available I've experienced a lot of loss recentlymy father and my And
not_available the one thing that helps me to deal with it is having a place that hasn't changed like everything else in my life .
not_available There's a reason they call it a " sanctuary .
not_available " I think the majority of our congregation feels the same way , and my responsibility is to them , not you .
not_available Well , I've got a business to run .
not_available Yo !
not_available Speaking .
not_available Yes , what can I do for you , Mr .
not_available Gilardi ?
not_available Here .
not_available This is good choice here .
not_available I don't like yellow .
not_available The bridesmaids' dresses are lilac .
not_available If the flowers are yellow , it's gonna look like an Easter egg hunt .
not_available How about white tulips ?
not_available Very simple , just bunched together with a ribbon .
not_available I was kind of thinking I would be the only one with white flowers .
not_available Or you could be the only one holding a gorgeous bouquet of color against your white dress .
not_available People do that ?
not_available It's your day .
not_available You can do whatever you want .
not_available Don't you think that would be pretty ?
not_available Mm hmm .
not_available I love the tulips thing .
not_available Tulips are one of my favorite flowers .
not_available So graceful and classic , like little ballerinas .
not_available The only reason I even met Victor is I jumped off a Hum V and broke my feet .
not_available Here I am in the hospital with this guy who's dying , it turns out , and listening to me complain .
not_available Playing cards , giving me his dessert .
not_available I wish he didn't die .
not_available It sucks .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Have you heard from Paul yet ?
not_available Not since I told him his brother was ready to be picked up .
not_available Well , without his consent in writing , I cannot allow this funeral to take place .
not_available Fine .
not_available At least we'll know we made an effort .
not_available When we were in the Gulf , Victor used to make these videotapes to send home to his family .
not_available We were always giving him a hard time , messing him up .
not_available He was a real good sport
not_available Is my brother ready ?
not_available Yes , he's right in here .
not_available What is this ?
not_available Victor's friends wanted to say goodbye .
not_available The hospital referred them , and it's no problem for us .
not_available And no charge to you .
not_available Excuse me , are you his brother ?
not_available Yes , I'm Paul .
not_available This man here , I don't know if you people know it , was like a lion for Victor .
not_available He made federal waves over Victor's disability case .
not_available I found a couple of pictures of us playing baseball .
not_available Victor was a lousy batter but a pretty good infielder .
not_available He's grinning like such a fool in these !
not_available I thought you might like them .
not_available Is that you ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available You sick ?
not_available No , never got sick .
not_available I don't know why .
not_available A lot of guys I knew over there did .
not_available Well , thanks .
not_available Thank you for letting Victor have his military burial , even though I knew you were against it .
not_available I'm sure this means a lot to him .
not_available What the fuck is this military burial shit ?
not_available It's an option that can easily be cancelled at no charge to you .
not_available Victor didn't want a military funeral .
not_available I told you that !
not_available You think I'm lying to you ?
not_available I think he was afraid to tell you what he wanted .
not_available He filled out those forms , Paul .
not_available He kept the videos .
not_available Dave filled out those forms .
not_available This is all fuckin' army PR .
not_available And I threw those forms in the trash .
not_available I'll call the service off right now .
not_available He kept Saudi Arabian candy for 10 years .
not_available You just want to jack up your price .
not_available No .
not_available It's paid for .
not_available I just want your brother to have the funeral he wanted for himself , because that's his right .
not_available Victor wanted to believe he died for something .
not_available You really want to take that away from him ?
not_available Jesus .
not_available He's the only family I had left , and he can't even tell me what he wants when he's dead !
not_available He thought I would have talked him out of it , and he's right .
not_available I would've .
not_available Why don't you sit with his friends ?
not_available Where is Ruth ?
not_available She's in the back , crying .
not_available What is wrong ?
not_available It's the smell of the flowers .
not_available You'll get used to it .
not_available I am used to it !
not_available Today , I helped people choose flowers for weddings , for anniversaries , for new babies .
not_available I can't remember being surrounded by so much happiness .
not_available I'm used to the smell of flowers being something completely different .
not_available I'm used to people crying and being exhausted , people being shattered .
not_available Do not worry .
not_available We get funerals too .
not_available I'm so happy !
not_available I can't wait to come back to work tomorrow !
not_available You're not going to be like this every day , though ?
not_available Right ?
not_available No .
not_available This flag is presented on behalf of a grateful nation as a token of our appreciation for honorable and faithful services rendered by your loved one .
not_available Give it to one of his friends .
not_available I love you , David .
not_available I always will .
not_available I could get hit by a bus .
not_available I'm going out to the desert tonight .
not_available Just wanted to make sure you knew that .
not_available I love you , too .
not_available You did the right thing today .
not_available I know .
not_available Feels good , doesn't it ?
not_available Hello .
not_available She can't go .
not_available Why not ?
not_available She has to help me pick prints for my show .
not_available Does she have to do it tonight ?
not_available Yes , she has to do it tonight .
not_available Billy's got a show coming up in a gallery in Westwood .
not_available Look , sometimes she gives me her eyes , OK , because sometimes I go blind .
not_available and sometimes I see amazing things , and sometimes I just see shapes , and that's when I go blind .
not_available What if I lost the ability to tell the difference for real , for good ?
not_available You won't .
not_available You say that , and then you give me your eyes , but what if I fuck up one day
not_available and I can't give them back to you ?
not_available Well , that won't happen .
not_available We won't let that happen .
not_available Oh , God , this is crap !
not_available This is pretentious , derivative crap !
not_available Well , then that's one less you have to consider .
not_available Right ?
not_available Right .
not_available Billy , I'm gonna go talk to Nate on the porch , OK ?
not_available Alright ,
not_available and then he's gonna go away !
not_available We'll be right outside .
not_available Pick out 5 you like and you can show them to me when I come back .
not_available Only 5 ?
not_available Or 10 or 20 ,
not_available and I'll look at them
not_available and I'll tell you what I see .
not_available OK .
not_available You could fuck her some other time .
not_available Sorry .
not_available He's obviously off his meds .
not_available What , intentionally ?
not_available No .
not_available Happens occasionally .
not_available It's been a while .
not_available Oh , Brenda , come on .
not_available Sorry , Nate , I can't .
not_available I'm all he has when he's like this .
not_available You are letting him manipulate you .
not_available You don't know him .
not_available You don't know what he's doing .
not_available Well , I know he doesn't like me , and I have a feeling he doesn't like any men in your life , am I right ?
not_available Answer me !
not_available What , you think I fucked my brother ?
not_available Jesus !
not_available I never said that !
not_available What Nate , he's sick .
not_available He's my brother , and he's sick , and he needs me .
not_available This is who I am .
not_available This is what you get .
not_available Fuck you !
not_available You have no idea how much I wanted to go with you .
not_available Can I do anything to help ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available You can go to the desert , and sit in mud , and relax , and forget about everything , including us .
not_available Oh , shit !
not_available Just go , OK , goddamn it ?

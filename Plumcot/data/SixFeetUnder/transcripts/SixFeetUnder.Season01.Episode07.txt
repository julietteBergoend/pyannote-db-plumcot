not_available Episode 7.
not_available brotherhood Hi, Mom and Paul and Patricia! Uh, well, I'm here.
not_available It's not exactly the Holiday Inn, as you can see.
not_available Mostly, mostly, um, we're filling sandbags and cleaning vehicle filters.
not_available This particular war, it's really important to keep the mechanisms clean, because of all the sand, which can be as much of a threat as any missile that Sadaam can send.
not_available Captain Summers saysI can?t say much, but pretty soon, we're gonna get into the real action, andand
not_available we're prepared, I'll tell ya.
not_available You guys, do you mind, please? I'm sending something to my folks.
not_available I'll be done in a minute.
not_available What else? We're protecting your ass, folks! I love you, America! Thank you! Come on, Bailey, come on, I'm just
not_available Hey, guys, wanna say hello to Vic and his folks? Hi, Mom! Come on, you guys! Damn it! Sorry, Mom.
not_available Listen, some of these guys are kind of crazy, but they're good soldiers.
not_available I'm getting a lot of responsibility here.
not_available I think it's been very beneficial in terms of personal leadership skills and getting a job A lot more than had I stayed at home.
not_available Well, I've got a lot to do before lights out, so until next time, this is Private First Class Victor Kovitch, signing off.
not_available Hey, buddy, brought you the latest "South Park".
not_available "VICTOR WAYNE KOVITCH, PFCOCTOBER 20, 1971
not_available MARCH 21, 2001" Fuck, David! Hey, sleepyhead! You know, I had the weirdest dream.
not_available Really? This guy comes into my house at like 4 AM, he climbs into my bed, but instead of having his way with me, he just passes out, and all night long, he keeps jerking.
not_available That is weird.
not_available And he talked in his sleep.
not_available Yeah, what did he say? It was completely unintelligible, but angry.
not_available Oh.
not_available There was even teeth
not_available grinding.
not_available Well that explains the headaches.
not_available I was thinking that exposure to formaldehyde might give me a brain tumor.
not_available Hey, would you like some caffeine with that tumor? OK.
not_available David, I can't.
not_available Why not? Because last night I drove Mr.
not_available Sanopoulous' body all the way to San Jose,then straight back.
not_available I barely got four hours sleep and, frankly, I'm getting tired of always getting the shitty jobs you don't want.
not_available I'm half owner of this business.
not_available You can't legally do intake without me.
not_available You're not a licensed funeral director.
not_available I'm getting my license next month.
not_available If you pass the test.
not_available Hey, thanks for the vote of confidence, and how am I supposed to study for that test with only like four hours sleep a night? Coffee and diet pills worked for me.
not_available Nate, I can't pick her up.
not_available I've got a deacons' meeting, and Rico's got Vanessa's ultrasound.
not_available Shit, you know, the last time I had to pick somebody up at a nursing home, nobody'd even told the roommate she was dead.
not_available I had to.
not_available Just be thankful we've got the business.
not_available Thankful I'm not you.
not_available What? Oh, Mr.
not_available Sanopoulous.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Fuck! I smell like a dead guy! No, you smell fine.
not_available Your life stinks, you complain all the time, and that's really dull.
not_available Didn't realize I was boring you.
not_available Nate, you need to take a break.
not_available Some major stress release that's not me.
not_available It's too much responsibility.
not_available I thought you liked being an undertaker's girlfriend.
not_available Is that what I am to you? Your girlfriend? Well, I like to think of you as my mistress.
not_available Well, then, you'd better start buyin' me a lot more shit,Mistah! God, I love you.
not_available OK, I said it.
not_available Let's just move on.
not_available Let's go to Two Bunch Palms this weekend.
not_available Uhwhat? Fuck it, yes, I'm just gonna
not_available I'm gonna take the weekend off, and David can just bite me.
not_available This weekend? Yeah, we'll sit in the hot mud, we'll get massages, we'll eat like pigs, we'll drink a lot.
not_available If we leave Friday night, we could be naked for two whole days.
not_available I got three clients this Saturday.
not_available Postpone, cancel, lie.
not_available Come on, we've never taken a trip together.
not_available We need to do this! Two whole days? What if we drive each other crazy? Well, we don't! Hovering.
not_available Claire, I've invited a friend of mine over for dinner tonight.
not_available OK.
not_available And I want you to be nice to him.
not_available Is this the guy? The guy that, uh
not_available Yes.
not_available OK.
not_available Thanks for your patience, everybody.
not_available I know we're running late.
not_available By the way, I spoke to Father Clark this morning.
not_available He's holding up well.
not_available He says you folks are the most thorough search committee he has ever encountered.
not_available David, I understand you're the last to meet with him.
not_available This afternoon.
not_available Good.
not_available We've been interviewing associate priests for three months.
not_available It'll be nice to have an open mind.
not_available Clark struck me as a player, a man of God, wants to listen, but there's ego there.
not_available You didn't want Jack.
not_available Connie, you say that so easily, and you know it's not true.
not_available I've never seen you so desperate.
not_available Listen, you folks have to represent the whole congregation, and, believe me, if Clark's not right, I'm ready to start over from the beginning.
not_available Let's vote right now.
not_available You know him, David, he's been a visiting rector.
not_available You've got his resume.
not_available All the deacons are here.
not_available There's no reason why you can't vote now.
not_available I'll be happy to leave the room.
not_available No, I want to meet with Father Clark myself so I can make the most informed decision.
not_available This how it works, Jack? You bring in the new generation deacon, the new deacon brings in the radical priest you want.
not_available I can assure you, there?'s no agenda here, Mr.
not_available Kriegenthaler.
not_available Except yours.
not_available Don't worry, Dave.
not_available I had a parish in Ohio where punches got thrown.
not_available Steel workers.
not_available St.
not_available Bart's doesn't even come close.
not_available Actually, David, your father was against Jack here, and, as I said at the time, your father was wrong.
not_available Wow! Shit! Fuck! Billy! Fuck you! I've seen pictures of this on the internet, but
not_available The rule is, you call before you come over, OK? I know.
not_available I'm sorry! I was biking down the boardwalk.
not_available I didn't have my cell phone on me.
not_available Good morning, Nate.
not_available Bill.
not_available Oh, Bren, I got some fucking amazing shots of these hookers on Sunset I wanna show you.
not_available Real human tragedy shit.
not_available I think they're really good.
not_available Well, your mom walked in on us once.
not_available So I guess now we're even.
not_available This chick has seen the fucking worst life has to offer.
not_available Jesus, Billy, these are incredible.
not_available And what is that thing on her neck? She's got like this big tumor, and she's still turning tricks.
not_available And you just know there is some freak for whom that is a big turn
not_available on.
not_available I love the Bank of America in the background.
not_available Well, I have to go to work.
not_available Bring out your dead! hey're great.
not_available Don't forget.
not_available ancel those appointments on Saturday.
not_available See you later.
not_available So what?s Saturday? We're going to California Cactus World out on Rosemary Boulevard.
not_available i want to get something really weird to plant out back.
not_available Yo, Dave! In here! Sorry, there was an accident on the 405.
not_available Both cars totaled.
not_available Should have stopped to hand out cards.
not_available This is Paul Kovitch.
not_available His brother, Victor, just passed away.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available This is my brother, Nate.
not_available Paul Kovitch? You went to Balventure High.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I was there when you pinned that huge guy from Eurekaand won the State Wrestling Championship.
not_available You're the man! Me and my friend were so jealous 'cause we all knew how much you were getting laid.
not_available You wrestle? No, played a little baseball, but we always lost So what are you doing now? Oh, run Kovitch Checking up in Camrio.
not_available Wise.
not_available You know how expensive you can be? No
not_available Paul and I were just going over the options for his brother's funeral.
not_available OK, I run a business, too.
not_available Let's just get right to it.
not_available Of course.
not_available I've buried both my parents, and, no offense, but I hate you guys.
not_available I hate what you do.
not_available The whole thing of "Let's all gather and look at this plastic dead version of our loved one.
not_available " It's really twisted.
not_available I want Victor cremated.
not_available No coffin.
not_available Put him in one of those cardboard boxes you charge $100 for.
not_available I'll take him up to where our mother's buried up in Tahatchapi and let his ashes blow away.
not_available I see Victor's a veteran.
not_available If you'd like, we can research any death benefits he might
not_available No.
not_available We hated the army.
not_available Me and him been fighting the army for seven years.
not_available His unit cleaned up the place called Bunker 73 in the Iraqi desert.
not_available chemicals all over.
not_available Sadaam's stuff we blew up.
not_available Soon as he came back, he got sick.
not_available Lung cancer at the age of 29.
not_available Never smoked a day in his life.
not_available Still, no one would say the word, "Gulf War Syndrome.
not_available " He just wasted away, lying in that hospital.
not_available So, fuck the army.
not_available Let 'em keep their fucking money.
not_available I've gotta fly up to Idaho Falls, tell my stepfather.
not_available He?s got Alzheimer's.
not_available I don't know if he'll hear me or not.
not_available You're absolutely sure you wouldn't like the opportunity to say goodbye to Victor before
not_available I already said goodbye.
not_available Just do it? And as for a receptacle for his remains? A paper sack oughtta do just fine.
not_available Well, he obviously doesn't know about the Poseidon Society, or that's 900 we'd be out of.
not_available That guy was the shit when I was in high school.
not_available You know, I never even knew he had a brother.
not_available It's time you introduced yourself.
not_available He's at the VA hospital.
not_available Alright, but first, I just gotta talk to you about something.
not_available Nate, it's out of the question.
not_available I cannot spare you.
not_available We have three bodies right now.
not_available What is the problem? Mr.
not_available Jacobson's going into the ground tomorrow,and Vic Kovitch will be toast by this weekend.
not_available What if we get another body? Or two? We cannot afford to turn down business.
not_available No, I'm sorry.
not_available I don't need your permission.
not_available Do you know how long it's been since I've had two days off? Well, you see, here's the 
difference You're willing to live like that.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I've invited my friend, Hiram Gunderson, over to dinner tonight.
not_available You're welcome to join us.
not_available Wouldn't a restaurant be better? This is our home.
not_available This is my home! Oh, the camping guy! OK.
not_available Can I bring Brenda? Hiram will be cooking.
not_available He spent 17 years as the top chef in Chicago.
not_available The food critic of The Sun Times called him the "father of the new rustic cuisine.
not_available " And then he gave it all up to become a hairdresser.
not_available And he has never been happier! You're multiplying differing variables.
not_available So? You have to simplify! OK? And then finally oops! look at that! Same variable, OK? 4 and 4 gives us what? And finally these two binomials right here are exactly the same, so we what? Combine! OK? Any questions? Claire Fisher! What? Can you explain this formula to the class? Not really.
not_available Well, maybe if you paid attention in class instead of reading.
not_available Well, maybe if you talked about something that was actually gonna be useful to me I would.
not_available Oh, algebra is useless? Mmm.
not_available Know a lot of physicists who'd beg to differ.
not_available Well, I don't want to be a physicist.
not_available Algebra forces your mind to solve problems logically.
not_available It's one of the only perfect sciences
not_available You think the world runs on logic? Come on.
not_available Open your eyes.
not_available OK, I'll see you after class, Miss Fisher.
not_available What are you doing? let's try this next one, and I'm gonna make this a little tougher.
not_available X to the a power, times y to the b power.
not_available OK, now we've got to
not_available Of course we have catalogues for wedding package, but you have to come in and look.
not_available I can't show you over the phone.
not_available Website? Not website.
not_available We don't have website! Mister, you have to come into my shop, and look at my work.
not_available Website! Ah! The day just got brighter! Hush! So who's dead now, and what do you need? Well, nobody's dead.
not_available I came to return these vases.
not_available You should recycle them.
not_available Save a little money.
not_available So thoughtful! I am touched! Well, don't be silly! It's wasteful, that's all.
not_available Here.
not_available You still have that sign in the window.
not_available Yes.
not_available You know somebody good? I do.
not_available Me.
not_available You? I am interested.
not_available Let's talk.
not_available Robby, I'm going to lunch.
not_available I'm not going to lunch with you, Nikolai.
not_available I'm seeing someone.
not_available So what? This is business.
not_available I hope so, because, otherwise, I withdraw my offer.
not_available Tell me.
not_available Why I should hire you? I've been working with people for over 30 years and I know how to treat them with respect.
not_available I respect people, too.
not_available You're pompous and arrogant, and you're full of yourself.
not_available You act like the customer needs you.
not_available Of course the customer needs me! I have what he wants! You'll never build a business that way! I'm better with people, and I know about flowers.
not_available And if you don't think so, you can fire me.
not_available Fire you? How I can fire you? You don't even work here yet! My parish in New Mexico, I think they were afraid of me.
not_available They recommend you highly.
not_available They always do after I'm gone.
not_available I won't lie to you, David.
not_available I'll push for some change at St.
not_available Bart's.
not_available This is one of those congregations that thinks that sitting through church once a week absolves them of all moral responsibility, and they ignore the plight of others.
not_available But, don't get me wrong, they're good people.
not_available They're just lazy.
not_available I don't think that's entirely fair, Clark.
not_available We have a homeless outreach.
not_available You know you're the swing vote.
not_available I've been a deacon three weeks.
not_available I'm still getting used to how political the whole thing is.
not_available Well, religion is politics, David.
not_available Jesus was a revolutionary, threatened those in power, and they had him assassinated.
not_available And they'd do the same thing to him today.
not_available I'm not sure how much luck you'll have to get St.
not_available Bart's to stage a coup.
not_available The last thing that God wants from us is complacency.
not_available Maybe you should be in the Peace Corps.
not_available Already done it.
not_available Three years in Nicaragua, fresh out of Divinity School.
not_available That's where I lost my wife.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available The hardest part about my work is the fact that most people don't want a real relationship with God.
not_available Yeah, sure, they'll pray to a man nailed to a cross, but they'll
not_available they'll ignore the gay kid who gets strung up, or the black man who gets dragged behind a car, or someone's mother living in a box.
not_available Were you this forthcoming with the other deacons? Hardly.
not_available What did you and Walter Kriegenthaler talk about? Golf.
not_available So, why did you decide to be so honest with me? Because I can tell that right and wrong actually matter to you.
not_available This thing is fucking medieval.
not_available We've gotta get it fixed before somebody loses a finger.
not_available Never cared until it was your finger.
not_available Rico, a little help? Why should I? You know, it's because of you I'm going to be working double shifts this weekend.
not_available OK, that's just David being dramatic.
not_available We need to get at least two new bodies for that to be necessary.
not_available They come in bigger numbers than that.
not_available Just forget it.
not_available I know the score.
not_available It's never gonna be Fisher &amp; Sons &amp; Diaz.
not_available I know that.
not_available Let's see what we got.
not_available This one's a direct cremation.
not_available Nothing for you.
not_available Oh, fuck! What is that? Shouldn't just burn people like they're garbage.
not_available What the
not_available Look, it came with fries.
not_available Now, look at this.
not_available Doesn't even look like the same guy, does it? It says he applied to be buried at the National Cemetary.
not_available Signed a request for a flag fold, military escort Oh, man! Then you can't burn him.
not_available I can make him look like that again.
not_available Or almost.
not_available You could ace algebra, Claire, and we both know it.
not_available Power rests in the kind of knowledge one holds, so what's the use of knowing something that's useless? Don't quote Castenada at me.
not_available Why not? You quote Bob Dylan at me.
not_available You need algebra for college.
not_available You're just assuming I'm going to college.
not_available I know you're taking the PSAT tomorrow afternoon.
not_available It means you're thinking about it.
not_available Is that the only option? Go to college, get a job so you could be a good consumer until you drop dead of exhaustion? I don't want that.
not_available So what do you want? I just want something to matter.
not_available Maybe I should wander around the desert and eat peyote and see God.
not_available Yeah, be a homeless drug addict.
not_available You'd get bored with that pretty fast.
not_available Hey, have you heard of the Sierra Crossroads Program? What is that? Like, "Bungee Jumping for Jesus"? No, no, it's not affiliated with any religion.
not_available It's actually a really great program.
not_available I spent a couple of years there as an instructor.
not_available I think you might really like it.
not_available Why? Because it would take you out of yourself, out of your head.
not_available Now, I'll warn you, it's hard, but exhilarating.
not_available I think it might just give you the challenge you're looking for.
not_available There's an expedition going out over spring break.
not_available I could pull some strings, see if I could get you in.
not_available Why do you care what happens to me? Because I like you, and I want to see good things happen for you, and I know they can.
not_available We're here to dig his service records out of St.
not_available Louis.
not_available Then there's the big question of whether his cancer was service
not_available related.
not_available That means finding a doctor who thinks he was, and it took me four months to get all the approvals, but it means a burial allowance of up to 1500 from the VA.
not_available Might as well take that stuff, too.
not_available I packed it up for him.
not_available It's too bad nobody told his brother what he wanted.
not_available I did.
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available I gave Paul the forms.
not_available I found them later in the trash.
not_available Well, it's mostly someone else's writing on the forms.
not_available It doesn't match Victor's signature at all.
not_available I filled them out for him.
not_available He tried to do it himself, but those boxes are pretty small, and he shook a lot.
not_available Gulf War Victory Parade? Victor said marching in it was the proudest moment of his life.
not_available Now, why would he keep it and watch it over and over if he hated the army? Did Paul visit him much? Oh, yeah.
not_available He was really good about it.
not_available So how come he
not_available He couldn't.
not_available Paul would say, "The fuckin' army stole your life, Vic,"and Vic would keep his mouth shut.
not_available I can tell you this, Victor wanted to believe that what he did in the Gulf meant something,that his life was not a waste.
not_available But, hey, I only counsel the veteran.
not_available I'm not supposed to interfere with what the family wants.
not_available So you taped his medals onto his chest, fished his files out of the trash, and passed them onto me? Well, you can always blow it off.
not_available I mean, you didn't even know the guy, right? What are you doing? There was a form that said he was getting a military funeral.
not_available Who authorized this? Nate? Uh
not_available yeah.
not_available Goddamn it, how many times have I told you when Nate gives you instructions, you are to check with me first? Turn him off.
not_available I'll drive him to the crematorium right now.
not_available Do I have to do it myself? Fuckin' Nate! Paul Kovitch is who our contract is with, and if he finds out about this, he will either sue us or break our legs.
not_available Wow! Uh, look who's here! Hello, Mrs.
not_available Fisher.
not_available Hello, dear.
not_available Hello, I'm Brenda.
not_available Hiram Gunderson.
not_available I understand you like to camp.
not_available Why, yes I do! I wish I could tell you where Nate was, but I have no idea.
not_available That's OK.
not_available I can exist without him.
not_available Toss some sesame seeds in the salad? Yes, that would be lovely! There's my little girl.
not_available Claire, honey, this is Hiram Gunderson.
not_available Pleasure to meet you, Claire.
not_available hi This is delicious, Mrs.
not_available Fisher.
not_available Hiram is a chef.
not_available Oh.
not_available I can't get enough of his cock! Oh, Mom, I need $1200 so I can go to Sierra Crossroads over spring break, and I need you to like sign this form like in case I die or something.
not_available Is this a school trip? No, you go to the mountains and confront fear and get in touch with your most basic self.
not_available It looks good on your college application.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available There was this major accident on the Long Beach Freeway.
not_available You always seem to get the bad traffic.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hi, I'm Nate.
not_available Hiram.
not_available I've heard a lot about you.
not_available Don't believe a word of it.
not_available Hey, I'm sorry.
not_available Don't be.
not_available I'm having fun.
not_available So what did I miss? I wanna go to Sierra Crossroads.
not_available We'll talk about it later, Claire.
not_available Oh, Mom, you should let her go.
not_available Crossroads is great.
not_available You went? Yeah, we went kyacking down the Colorado River the summer I was
not_available what? I don't think you were even born yet.
not_available I don't remember this.
not_available Ah, that's because I lied to you and Dad.
not_available I know Dad'd never let me go, so I told you I was going to Sacramento to witness state government in action.
not_available Oh, by the way, everyone, I got a job.
not_available Cool.
not_available I'll be working at Nikolai's Flower Shop.
not_available I start tomorrow.
not_available It's just part
not_available time.
not_available You didn't tell me about that.
not_available Didn't I? Need some help? Incidentally, Nate, I dropped Victor Kovitch off at the Oak Valley Crematory.
not_available I need you to pick him up first thing tomorrow.
not_available Oh, fuck, David.
not_available He wanted a military funeral.
not_available He filled out the forms.
not_available Is he paying our bill? You were there with his brother.
not_available It was clear he did not want the body embalmed.
not_available He could sue us, and we wouldn't have a case.
not_available OK, you know what, when you talk to me like this, it makes me want to not listen to a word you say.
not_available You and I could lose everything.
not_available Mom could lose her home.
not_available You know, Vic is eligible for a much bigger burial allowance from the VA than we thought.
not_available Really? I'm leaving.
not_available I'll walk you down.
not_available Bye, David.
not_available Bye.
not_available Why don't you come over? Spend the night? I can't.
not_available I've gotta be in Pasadena tomorrow morning, and it'd add an extra hour to my trip.
not_available OK.
not_available Give me five minutes /I'll follow you.
not_available Tonight wasn't so bad, was it? I suppose not.
not_available I don't know why I was so nervous.
not_available I mean, for heavens sake, I gave birth to those people! You know what occurred to me tonight that's really strange? I wish you'd known my husband.
not_available I think the two of you would have liked each other.
not_available Who would get me a gift basket? It's probably some Hollywood bigwig you work on who secretly wants to sleep with you.
not_available Oh, it's from my brother, and it is addressed to both of us.
not_available "Sorry about this morning.
not_available Have fun at Cactus World" Who knows? Well, this is nice.
not_available We could take it with us on the weekend.
not_available I cannot wait to get out of here.
not_available I'm in dire need of some serious relaxation.
not_available Oh, fabulous! Smoked oysters.
not_available Really? Is there any caviar? No, but there are condoms, and ok edible underpants.
not_available That's a little scary.
not_available I'd say this whole thing is a little scary.
not_available No, it just means he likes you.
not_available Believe me, there were guys Billy didn't like.
not_available It's much better this way.
not_available I've been meaning to ask you.
not_available What's up with those matching tattoos you two have? We're in Vegas.
not_available We were very drunk, and..
not_available oh dear! These things always struck me as kind of ridiculous.
not_available Would you just stop that? What does he think we're gonna do with this? Brenda, this is like hostile! Look, Billy is bipolar.
not_available He's medicated.
not_available Sense of what's appropriate can be a little off at times.
not_available Look, you have no idea what he's been through.
not_available Don't judge him Please.
not_available Alright.
not_available Alright.
not_available You're never gonna work your way out of this one, soldier.
not_available I was nowhere near the latrine, sir, I promise.
not_available Give it up, private! Your ass is busted! Yeah, you're in big trouble! But my father's on the Joint Chief of Staff! Well, maybe we can't court martial you, but there is something else we can do.
not_available Come on, private! Yeah! You love that, don't you? Hello? David? Walter Kriegenthaler.
not_available Did you meet with Father Clark? Yes, today.
not_available We'd like to meet at 9:30 tomorrow.
not_available Can you make it? Absolutely.
not_available And let me ask you a question, David.
not_available Do you think Clark is gay? Uh
not_available I don't think so.
not_available He mentioned something about having a deceased wife.
not_available I mean, I don't care if he is.
not_available I just don't want him to push that agenda, you know? Marriage, that whole thing.
not_available I have a cousin in DC whose church split because of that.
not_available Literally half the congregation left, and I don't want to see that happen to St.
not_available Bart's.
not_available I've been going there for 40 years.
not_available Well, it's late.
not_available I'll see you tomorrow morning.
not_available Good night.
not_available OK I got Victor, but I called the National Cemetary from the car, and, you know what?/ They can bury an urn.
not_available They call it "in urn," and we could do it today at 3.
not_available Why are you so determined to sabotage our business? I don't think Paul ever knew how his brother ever really felt.
not_available Nate, why do you even care? Because it's what Victor wanted, and he deserves it.
not_available He'd get a raw fuckin' deal, I'm telling you.
not_available Victor Kovitch did not hate the army.
not_available You just watch these tapes he made in the Gulf.
not_available Yes, sir, fuck me, sergeant! Oh, fuck, yeah! Give it to me! Take it! Oh, come on, come on, it's funny.
not_available I have someplace I have to be.
not_available Dave, Dave, it's OK.
not_available I watch porn too! So, you guys taking the PSAT this afternoon too? Uh
not_available yeah.
not_available What happens to you guys? I go to UC Irvine and Northwestern Law, meet a totally great guy.
not_available He's a tri
not_available athlete.
not_available We get married, and I practice law for 8 years, and we get really rich, and then I have 2 great kids.
not_available So, you're, like, unbelievably happy.
not_available Kind of.
not_available I get a Masters in French, and then live in Paris for 6 months and hate it So I come back, become a TV development executive, and I work out all the time I'm fairly miserable and have a slight substance abuse problem.
not_available But you look great.
not_available Thanks.
not_available I start an interior lighting design firm with my college roommate, and it totally takes off.
not_available And then I die of ovarian cancer before I'm 30.
not_available Oh, that sucks.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available Well, good luck.
not_available What a freak! Father Jack? David! Come in, sit.
not_available And call me Jack.
not_available We're beyond that.
not_available Meeting over already? Yes.
not_available Damn.
not_available We all admire Clark's energy, but there is some concern that he may end up being divisive.
not_available As you said yourself, if we have to go back and start from the beginning
not_available And find some conservative lapdog who won't challenge anybody? Yeah, that's what we need here.
not_available Scotch? No, thank you.
not_available Clark thought he came on a little too strong with you.
not_available I liked him, Jack.
not_available I think the world would be a better place if there were more men like him.
not_available I just don't think that he's a good fit for St.
not_available Bart?s.
not_available Do you really think that Father Clark would be happy here? Why should he be happy? How happy are you? You're right.
not_available I'm not happy.
not_available My life is very complicated and confusing.
not_available I've experienced a lot of loss recentlymy father and my
not_available And the one thing that helps me to deal with it is having a place that hasn't changed like everything else in my life.
not_available There's a reason they call it a "sanctuary.
not_available " I think the majority of our congregation feels the same way, and my responsibility is to them, not you.
not_available Well, I've got a business to run.
not_available Yo! Speaking.
not_available Yes, what can I do for you, Mr.
not_available Gilardi? Here.
not_available This is good choice here.
not_available I don't like yellow.
not_available The bridesmaids' dresses are lilac.
not_available If the flowers are yellow, it's gonna look like an Easter egg hunt.
not_available How about white tulips? Very simple, just bunched together with a ribbon.
not_available I was kind of thinking I would be the only one with white flowers.
not_available Or you could be the only one holding a gorgeous bouquet of color against your white dress.
not_available People do that? It's your day.
not_available You can do whatever you want.
not_available Don't you think that would be pretty? Mm hmm.
not_available I love the tulips thing.
not_available Tulips are one of my favorite flowers.
not_available So graceful and classic, like little ballerinas.
not_available The only reason I even met Victor is I jumped off a Hum
not_available V and broke my feet.
not_available Here I am in the hospital with this guy who's dying, it turns out, and listening to me complain.
not_available Playing cards, giving me his dessert.
not_available I wish he didn't die.
not_available It sucks.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Have you heard from Paul yet? Not since I told him his brother was ready to be picked up.
not_available Well, without his consent in writing, I cannot allow this funeral to take place.
not_available Fine.
not_available At least we'll know we made an effort.
not_available When we were in the Gulf, Victor used to make these videotapes to send home to his family.
not_available We were always giving him a hard time, messing him up.
not_available He was a real good sport Is my brother ready? Yes, he's right in here.
not_available What is this? Victor's friends wanted to say goodbye.
not_available The hospital referred them, and it's no problem for us.
not_available And no charge to you.
not_available Excuse me, are you his brother? Yes, I'm Paul.
not_available This man here, I don't know if you people know it, was like a lion for Victor.
not_available He made federal waves over Victor's disability case.
not_available I found a couple of pictures of us playing baseball.
not_available Victor was a lousy batter but a pretty good infielder.
not_available He's grinning like such a fool in these! I thought you might like them.
not_available Is that you? Yeah.
not_available You sick? No, never got sick.
not_available I don't know why.
not_available A lot of guys I knew over there did.
not_available Well, thanks.
not_available Thank you for letting Victor have his military burial, even though I knew you were against it.
not_available I'm sure this means a lot to him.
not_available What the fuck is this military burial shit? It's an option that can easily be cancelled at no charge to you.
not_available Victor didn't want a military funeral.
not_available I told you that! You think I'm lying to you? I think he was afraid to tell you what he wanted.
not_available He filled out those forms, Paul.
not_available He kept the videos.
not_available Dave filled out those forms.
not_available This is all fuckin' army PR.
not_available And I threw those forms in the trash.
not_available I'll call the service off right now.
not_available He kept Saudi Arabian candy for 10 years.
not_available You just want to jack up your price.
not_available No.
not_available It's paid for.
not_available I just want your brother to have the funeral he wanted for himself, because that's his right.
not_available Victor wanted to believe he died for something.
not_available You really want to take that away from him? Jesus.
not_available He's the only family I had left, and he can't even tell me what he wants when he's dead! He thought I would have talked him out of it, and he's right.
not_available I would've.
not_available Why don't you sit with his friends? Where is Ruth? She's in the back, crying.
not_available What is wrong? It's the smell of the flowers.
not_available You'll get used to it.
not_available I am used to it! Today, I helped people choose flowers for weddings, for anniversaries, for new babies.
not_available I can't remember being surrounded by so much happiness.
not_available I'm used to the smell of flowers being something completely different.
not_available I'm used to people crying and being exhausted, people being shattered.
not_available Do not worry.
not_available We get funerals too.
not_available I'm so happy! I can't wait to come back to work tomorrow! You're not going to be like this every day, though? Right? No.
not_available This flag is presented on behalf of a grateful nation as a token of our appreciation for honorable and faithful services rendered by your loved one.
not_available Give it to one of his friends.
not_available I love you, David.
not_available I always will.
not_available I could get hit by a bus.
not_available I'm going out to the desert tonight.
not_available Just wanted to make sure you knew that.
not_available I love you, too.
not_available You did the right thing today.
not_available I know.
not_available Feels good, doesn't it? Hello.
not_available She can't go.
not_available Why not? She has to help me pick prints for my show.
not_available Does she have to do it tonight? Yes, she has to do it tonight.
not_available Billy's got a show coming up in a gallery in Westwood.
not_available Look, sometimes she gives me her eyes, OK, because sometimes I go blind.
not_available and sometimes I see amazing things, and sometimes I just see shapes, and that's when I go blind.
not_available What if I lost the ability to tell the difference for real, for good? You won't.
not_available You say that, and then you give me your eyes, but what if I fuck up one day and I can't give them back to you? Well, that won't happen.
not_available We won't let that happen.
not_available Oh, God, this is crap! This is pretentious, derivative crap! Well, then that's one less you have to consider.
not_available Right? Right.
not_available Billy, I'm gonna go talk to Nate on the porch, OK? Alright, and then he's gonna go away! We'll be right outside.
not_available Pick out 5 you like and you can show them to me when I come back.
not_available Only 5? Or 10 or 20, and I'll look at them and I'll tell you what I see.
not_available OK.
not_available You could fuck her some other time.
not_available Sorry.
not_available He's obviously off his meds.
not_available What, intentionally? No.
not_available Happens occasionally.
not_available It's been a while.
not_available Oh, Brenda, come on.
not_available Sorry, Nate, I can't.
not_available I'm all he has when he's like this.
not_available You are letting him manipulate you.
not_available You don't know him.
not_available You don't know what he's doing.
not_available Well, I know he doesn't like me, and I have a feeling he doesn't like any men in your life, am I right? Answer me! What, you think I fucked my brother? Jesus! I never said that! What
not_available Nate, he's sick.
not_available He's my brother, and he's sick, and he needs me.
not_available This is who I am.
not_available This is what you get.
not_available Fuck you! You have no idea how much I wanted to go with you.
not_available Can I do anything to help? Yeah.
not_available You can go to the desert, and sit in mud, and relax, and forget about everything, including us.
not_available Oh, shit! Just go, OK, goddamn it?

not_available Damn , this house is cold .
not_available Shit , Hattie , it's like a goddamn ice box .
not_available Well , no wonder !
not_available Girl , are you crazy ?
not_available We live in the desert .
not_available gets cold at night .
not_available You plan on sleeping all day ?
not_available Plan on gettin' me some breakfast before nightfall !

not_available Get your lazy ass up .
not_available Come on , this ain't the old folks' home .
not_available Hattie ?
not_available Hattie ?
not_available Hattie ! "
not_available " I hate this client .
not_available Every time she gets dumped by a guy , she gets a puppy .
not_available So now she's got like 15 dogs , they're all male , they're all huge , and they sit there and watch with their tongues hanging out while I work on her .
not_available It's like being in some live sex show for Asian businessmen , frat boys which I actually did for a while , back in the 80s , make some money .
not_available I got this great thing going with ping pong balls you'd really like .
not_available I must show it to you sometime .
not_available Hey , wouldn't it be funny if I got some hedge clippers and cut off your dick ?
not_available What ?
not_available Do me a favor , OK ?
not_available Don't read that shit in front of me .
not_available You gave it to me .
not_available Yeah , come on , I'm late .
not_available I'm at the part with the doll .
not_available Why is your doll angry ?
not_available Because she got raped .
not_available Really ?
not_available By who ?
not_available By you .
not_available Brenda , do you know what " raped " means ?
not_available It means she was forced into sexual intercourse against her will .
not_available It's so cool .
not_available You were obviously doing it to scare him into leaving you alone , right ?
not_available What do you want from me ?
not_available I was 8 .
not_available Did it work ?
not_available No , it didn't work .
not_available I just got a whole new level of scrutiny by a whole different set of vultures , only this time they were women .
not_available I'm leaving .
not_available You still want a ride ?
not_available You alright ?
not_available Yes , I'm fine .
not_available What are you doing today ?
not_available Um , well , the cabinets .
not_available I'm gonna try to organize the cabinets .
not_available Good .
not_available I'll be downstairs .
not_available Alright .
not_available Hey , Bobby !
not_available Yeah ?
not_available Bring the Lincoln Town Car round front .
not_available OK .
not_available You're the other Fisher boy , huh ?
not_available The one from where ?
not_available Oregon ?
not_available Seattle .
not_available Right .
not_available The health food thing .
not_available Yup .
not_available I remember your dad talked about you .
not_available Sorry to hear about him , man .
not_available He was a funny guy .
not_available Yeah ?
not_available No , you don't pay .
not_available Don't pay ?
not_available Yeah , your dad buried my brother a few years back .
not_available It was in trade .
not_available My father traded a funeral for oil changes ?
not_available Yeah , I guess so .
not_available Bye , Mom , have a good day .
not_available So would you like us to take care of finding you a cemetery plot , Mr . Jones ?
not_available Yeah , I don't wanna do that .
not_available Would you like a double plot ?
not_available What for ?
not_available Well , one for your wife and one for you .
not_available Next to each other .
not_available Is this what you do all the time ?
not_available Sell people their own graves ?
not_available Well , yes , sir .
not_available This is my job .
not_available Don't try to pull that shit with me , boy .
not_available I want a simple box .
not_available No frills .
not_available You can't take advantage of me because I'm old .
not_available I'll kick your ass !
not_available Just a single plot , then .
not_available No .
not_available Double plot .
not_available Shit .
not_available Will you want Mrs . Jones prepared for viewing ?
not_available Yes , I want to see her , but I don't want you messin' with her none .
not_available I don't want you to cut her or stick her or pickle her like an egg .
not_available If you want a viewing , I strongly would recommend That's my wife , boy
not_available , I don't want you to touch her !
not_available Mr .
not_available Jones , I can guarantee that you will not want to see her , nor will anybody else , unless she's been embalmed .
not_available I would beg you to consider what your wife would want .
not_available She's dead , fool !
not_available Don't matter what she wants !
not_available Well , yes , sir , but after death , the body immediately begins to decompose much quicker than you might think .
not_available The skin begins to separate , there's quite an unpleasant odor .
not_available Should you choose to forego embalming , my recommendation would be cremation , as soon as possible .
not_available That's just the way it is , Mr . Jones .
not_available I don't want to burn her up .
not_available I want to see her .
not_available Fine .
not_available You do understand , however , that that means she'll have to be embalmed .
not_available I ain't payin' for that .
not_available Sir , the cost is minimal I will waive the embalming fee , Mr . Jones , alright ?
not_available That was a good sermon , I thought .
not_available Did you ?
not_available You didn't ?
not_available I didn't really listen to it .
not_available Hello !
not_available Hello !
not_available Hello .
not_available Hello , Mrs .

not_available Yes , in here !
not_available Who's your friend ?
not_available Hell if I know !
not_available His wife died , and he wanted to see her .
not_available I guess she isn't ready yet .
not_available He looked like he was about to keel over , so I helped him sit down .
not_available Then I had to listen to him bitch and moan about public transportation for fucking ever , and then he just , like , passed out .
not_available Now I can't get his fucking hand to let go !
not_available Maybe he died .
not_available Very funny .
not_available No , he's still breathing .
not_available And farting .
not_available Can you help me pry his hand loose ?
not_available Sure .
not_available Is Nate around ?
not_available I just bought this fabulous antique chest , weighs a ton .
not_available I'm gonna need a hand getting it home .
not_available No , I haven't seen him .
not_available I can help you move it , though .
not_available no , thanks .
not_available So what ?
not_available I'm no good because the whole cabinet thing is just foreplay for you to fuck my brother ?
not_available No .
not_available I'm just not into babysitting high school girls .
not_available No offense .
not_available Let go of me !
not_available Goddamn !
not_available What are you all trying to do ?
not_available Trying to steal my watch ?
not_available I oughtta call the goddamn cops !
not_available Why ?
not_available You're the one who's breaking and entering !
not_available Look , we've gotta go move a chest .
not_available Someone should be back soon to let you see your wife .
not_available Hey , little girl .
not_available What ?
not_available You ain't foolin' nobody .
not_available Great .
not_available Thanks .
not_available I'll work on that .
not_available Look , I'll be like one minute to change , OK ?
not_available Are you gonna be OK here alone ?
not_available Everybody's alone .
not_available You're born alone , you die alone , goddamn it .
not_available I'm sorry about your wife .
not_available You didn't know her .
not_available jessica Wilcox ?
not_available I'm Nate Fisher , Nathaniel's son .
not_available I wondered why I hadn't heard from Nathaniel in quite a while .
not_available I hate this .
not_available I hate that I'll never see him again .
not_available He was such a kook !
not_available Kook ?
not_available Dad ?
not_available I don't think anybody made me laugh like that .
not_available He had such a sense of humor .
not_available So I hear .
not_available He was really proud of you .
not_available I'm Nate , not David .
not_available I know who you are .
not_available You're the one who took off .
not_available Your father really respected you for that .
not_available Said he wished he'd had the guts to do that when he was a kid .
not_available Ms Wilcox , did you have some kind of arrangement with my father ?
not_available Arrangement ?
not_available In our ledgers , some of the funerals were marked differently , and your mother's was one .
not_available Seems my father sometimes traded his services for payments other than cash .
not_available Please don't take this the wrong way , but can I see some kind of identification ?
not_available Driver?s license would do .
not_available Uh sure .
not_available Libra , huh ?
not_available I would've taken you for a Capricorn .
not_available You drink a lot of coffee up in Seattle ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Better be careful .
not_available Give you kidney stones .
not_available Oh , come on !
not_available Surely you wouldn't begrudge your father such a minor indulgence !
not_available My father never smoked pot .
not_available Not in front of you , he didn't .
not_available It's the finest organic .
not_available Grown in San Francisco by my son .
not_available Take it .
not_available It's your father's monthly supply .
not_available How is your mother doing with the grieving , David ?
not_available She is fine .
not_available As far as I can tell .
not_available You know her .
not_available She likes to suffer in silence .
not_available That seems to be a family trait .
not_available You know it's God's will for us to live our lives fully .
not_available Breathing in the joy around us , not just shouldering the pain .
not_available God wants us to be happy .
not_available I call them energy buns .
not_available They're my own recipe .
not_available Well , not really .
not_available Adding the peppers was something I picked up on my honeymoon .
not_available Have you ever been to Brazil ?
not_available no .
not_available Oh my God , Brazilians are the most beautiful people alive .
not_available They're like these fabulous mongrels who've incorporated all the very best attributes from ever race .
not_available I mean , all that crossbreeding , hello !
not_available I had a half breed mutt who lived to be almost 20 ,
not_available and then I got this purebred ,
not_available Corky , and its hips disintegrated before it was even 2
not_available Here you go .
not_available Fuck you , church freaks !
not_available Well , enjoy .
not_available Do you cook ?
not_available I hate cooking just for myself .
not_available That's the worst part about being divorced .
not_available That and the no regular sex thing .
not_available Daivd , could I talk to you for a moment ?
not_available Alone .
not_available Excuse us .
not_available What do you want ?
not_available Ruth won't talk to me .
not_available I'm worried about her .
not_available I was hoping that you couldYou were fucking my mother while my father was still alive , and now you want me to I understand if you're upset with me .
not_available Understand this .
not_available Whatever you have with my mother is between you and her , but I have no interest in helping you .
not_available Table for one ?
not_available Are you the owner ?
not_available Yes .
not_available Did you know my father , Nathaniel Fisher ?
not_available This used to be our storeroom .
not_available But when I finally got a loan from the bank , I put an extension onto the kitchen .
not_available Your father buried my wife seven years ago .
not_available I have very little money for the funeral .
not_available He asked if he could have this room as his own , and that would be my settlement .
not_available What did he do here ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available Stay as long as you would like .
not_available How often did he come here ?
not_available Well , sometimes we wouldn't see him for months .
not_available Sometimes he was here everyday .
not_available Mrs .
not_available Fisher !
not_available Good afternoon , Nikolai !
not_available I don't believe I've had the chance to thank you yet .
not_available When Kroehner started pressuring everyone to cut us off , most of our suppliers just abandoned Fisher &amp ; Sons .
not_available You stuck with us .
not_available Of course I stick with you !
not_available Thank you .
not_available These flowers are not gonna plant themselves .
not_available Such delicate skin .
not_available You have Russian color .
not_available I do ?
not_available You don't like the beauty you have ?
not_available The front door is open .
not_available You can leave the flowers inside .
not_available OK .
not_available OK , that is where the chest is gonna have to stay .
not_available God , that shit is heavy .
not_available You wanted to help .
not_available Oh my God , is this yours ?
not_available No , that's Nate's , but he keeps leaving it in my car .
not_available I love this book !
not_available You read it ?
not_available Oh , yeah ,
not_available my friends and re all over this like 2 summers ago , before they turned into pretentious drama nerds and totally abandoned me .
not_available Thank God .
not_available What's your favorite part ?
not_available Oh , they're too numerous to mention .
not_available Where is that part where she like stops speaking for a month and just barks at them ?
not_available Brenda Brenda
not_available , I know you're angry .
not_available Can you talk to me ?
not_available You know , they put me in therapy 'cause I stole that foot .
not_available Yeah , Nate told me .
not_available God , I would love to go into one of those sessions and just bark .
not_available Just to see the look on his face .
not_available Do you totally identify with this book ?
not_available Of course she does .
not_available It's about her .
not_available What?! ?
not_available She's Charlotte .
not_available You're shitting me !
not_available Is he for real ?
not_available Completely .
not_available Oh my God !
not_available Oh my God !
not_available is like meeting Ghandi or Jesus !
not_available Don't tell me .
not_available The book spoke to you , like it was written specifically for you .
not_available Well , yeah , in a way .
not_available Have you been to the website ?
not_available There's a website ?
not_available Oh , yes , there's a fan club .
not_available Yeah , those lonely little girls desperate for something to emulate , because , apparently , they're not original enough to come up with anything on their own .
not_available Well , that's what I like to see .
not_available ing before sundown .
not_available Hi , I'm Billy .
not_available I'm Claire .
not_available How do you know my sister ?
not_available Through my brother , Nate .
not_available They're dating .
not_available Oh , yeah .
not_available Dating .
not_available what ?
not_available Going steady ?
not_available He give her his ID bracelet ?
not_available She carve his initials in her arm so they'd be there forever ?
not_available Yo , Bren , you should've seen me out on the ocean .
not_available All those Venice dicks , taking themselves so seriously !
not_available You surf ?
not_available Me ?
not_available do I look like I surf ?
not_available Do I ?
not_available Uh
not_available oh .
not_available You'll freeze your ass off this time of year , wearing that kind of thing .
not_available So ?
not_available It's my ass .
not_available Oh , fine , you wanna get pneumonia again ?
not_available Go right ahead !
not_available Claire , I should take you home .
not_available I got stuff to do .
not_available No , that's alright .
not_available I'll take her .
not_available Great .
not_available Oh , no .
not_available I've got time .
not_available We just need to go right now .
not_available Well , if you have got stuff to do , don't worry about it .
not_available Yeah , do your stuff .
not_available I just have to take a shower .
not_available So , I'm walking along one day , and this asshole stops me and asks if I'm alright .
not_available He says I got a look .
not_available He'd seen a man with that same look once and had ignored it .
not_available And that man had jumped out of a 9 story window .
not_available You know the reconstruction involved in a death like that ?
not_available This business gets under your skin .
not_available It's like a fucking virus .
not_available They can even see it on your face .
not_available Smell it on you .
not_available What the hell is this place ?
not_available This music ?
not_available Since when do you listen to The Classics Four ?
not_available What the hell did you do here ?
not_available Who the hell are you ?
not_available So many questions .
not_available Why couldn't you ask them when I was still ALIVE?! ?
not_available It's OK .
not_available I couldn't answer most of them , anyway .
not_available Unlike now .
not_available Now , I'm a fucking prophet .
not_available Right .
not_available You think I'm kidding , buddy boy ?
not_available That's one of the perks of being dead .
not_available You know what happens after you're dead , and you know the meaning of life .
not_available That seems fairly useless .
not_available Yeah , I know .
not_available Life is wasted on the living .
not_available Could have told me you were proud of me .
not_available You were never around for me to tell , which is exactly what I was proud of you for .
not_available Therein lies your catch 22 .
not_available So , what's the meaning of life ?
not_available Really wanna know ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available Will it fuck me up if I do ?
not_available Oh , David , you make such a handsome deacon .
not_available All those old stiffs .
not_available Finally , a dose of viagra to the place !
not_available Oh , I don't mean that literally .
not_available Not like you'd need it .
not_available Thank you , Tracy .
not_available So , no fiancee , huh ?
not_available No , no , that's over .
not_available But she broke my heart , and I'm just not ready or interested in any sort of relationship right now .
not_available Oh , come on , any relationship ?
not_available I'm just not ready , and I doubt I will be for quite some time .
not_available Well , what if Cindy Crawford were to walk up to you and say , " Just use me for sex " ?
not_available I would say no .
not_available Liar .
not_available Is it so wrong to want a little human contact ?
not_available You're lonely , too .
not_available I can tell .
not_available For Chrissake , Tracy , what does it take ?
not_available No .
not_available Well , you don't have to be so mean about it .
not_available Apparently I do .
not_available Look , I come here to feed these people because I don't want to talk to anybody .
not_available Do us both a favor .
not_available Go to a bar .
not_available Pick somebody up .
not_available No , no , we just met .
not_available I know .
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available I'm just so turned on by you .
not_available Shut up .
not_available I have to go home .
not_available Hey , I wanna see you again .
not_available Good .
not_available But I'm not some skank for you to fuck .
not_available If that's what you're into , just go and find that somewhere else .
not_available That's not what I'm into , Claire .
not_available I swear .
not_available If you're lying , I swear to God , I will kill you .
not_available I will kick your ass .
not_available You do not want to mess with me .
not_available That ain't her .
not_available Excuse me ?
not_available That ain't my wife .
not_available That ain't my Hattie
not_available What'd you do with my Hattie ?
not_available Mr .
not_available Jones , with all due respect I don't want your respect .
not_available I want my wife .
not_available Sir , that is your wife .
not_available You married ?
not_available Yes , sir .
not_available Is she all young and pretty and knows how to treat you right ?
not_available Yes , sir .
not_available You can't believe how lucky you are , how life can be so good to you , right ?
not_available She gonna turn into that .
not_available We all do .
not_available Well , don't that piss you off , boy ?
not_available Not yet .
not_available He used this how long ?
not_available Seven years .
not_available It's weird how you keep showing me rooms people used to live in .
not_available I just think it's so fucking weird .
not_available He'd sit in
not_available this sad , little room doing God knows what .
not_available Why does it have to be sad ?
not_available Look around .
not_available I think it's fascinating .
not_available Really , why ?
not_available Such a mystery , ya know ?
not_available You'll neverk now what went on here .
not_available That's exactly what's driving me crazy .
not_available So what if you did know , had it all explained to you ?
not_available I bet it wouldn't be nearly as interesting or fun .
not_available Your father would be a lot more boring .
not_available Enjoy this !
not_available Come on , don't you pick up on something ?
not_available I thought things left marks in people , in places , in time .
not_available So , what , you think I'm a witch ?
not_available You really don't get any kind of vibe from this place at all ?
not_available You wanna know what I think ?
not_available I think your father wanted some place that was just his and nobody else's .
not_available Nate , if you didn't know him when he was alive , you never will .
not_available I don't wanna be somebody who when I die nobody knows who I was .
not_available So don't be .
not_available How are you doing , Mr . Jones ?
not_available I'm sitting here , holding my dead wife's hand .
not_available How do you think I'm doing ?
not_available you'll let me know if you need anything .
not_available hello .
not_available For Jones .
not_available Oh , Mr . Jones , see the beautiful flowers for your wife's viewing tomorrow ?
not_available I don't know why you so excited .
not_available They're just gonna grow up and die .
not_available Well , thank you .
not_available I'll see you out .
not_available I don't know what you think you're doing , but I'm going to have to ask my sons to order flowers from another florist if this behavior continues .
not_available Which behavior ?
not_available This is our place of business .
not_available There are grieving people here .
not_available I can't have you skulking round with that look in your eye .
not_available What look ?
not_available That sex look .
not_available Maybe you like it .
not_available Lady wear red , she means business .
not_available This is just what was clean .
not_available Lady , I can see you from here , and I'm blind and deaf .
not_available You need to get yourself laid .
not_available Time warp !

not_available You are a natural !
not_available Look at you !

not_available Hardly .
not_available Alright , it's on timer .
not_available Something to remember me by .
not_available Hey , what do you think about Brenda and your brother ?
not_available Think they have a chance in hell ?
not_available I hope so .
not_available She's pretty amazing .
not_available He'd be a real idiot to let her go .
not_available But again he's capable of being an idiot sometimes .
not_available So what is she to him ?
not_available Just hot sex ?
not_available I think he's really in love with her .
not_available How could he not be ?
not_available Shit , I'm thirsty .
not_available You got any beer ?
not_available No , sorry .
not_available It's alright .
not_available I should be heading out anyway .
not_available Oh , OK .
not_available I had fun today .
not_available Me too .
not_available Let's do this again .
not_available OK .
not_available OK , Mr . Bosun is all juiced up .
not_available I'll be in around 7 tomorrow to airbrush him .
not_available Get him ready for the viewing tomorrow .
not_available Unless , you know , you want me to do him now .
not_available I was kind of hoping to get home before Vanessa put Julio down .
not_available That's fine .
not_available Good night .
not_available Need any help ?
not_available No , Federico , go home to your family .
not_available Don't work too hard .
not_available Mr .
not_available Jones ?
not_available Time to go home .
not_available Who the hell are you ?
not_available I'm Nate .
not_available Work here .

not_available I know .
not_available I'm very sorry .
not_available day in , day out .
not_available It's late .
not_available Maybe I should drive you home .
not_available Shut the fuck up , boy , and let an old man speak .
not_available OK .
not_available She chased me across the front yard with a steak knife once , tried to cut my ass .
not_available Then we spent close to a year apart .
not_available That time's like a hole in me now .
not_available She was the only one who ever really knew me .
not_available You know , your wife will always be with you in your memories .
not_available When you love somebody that much , they never really You sell that shit to somebody who's buyin'

not_available We were together for nearly 2 years and then he dumped me for a 22 yearold stand in he
not_available met on location .
not_available I think that's the only picture I had of him that I didn't tear up .
not_available Funny , you know , you think you know somebody , and I hear he's in AA now .
not_available So , are you in the business ?
not_available No , no , I'm a lawyer .
not_available I'm from Boston .
not_available God , how refreshing !
not_available You tend to forget sometimes living in LA that there's this world outside the entertainment industry .
not_available And that's the real world .
not_available So what do you do ?
not_available Production accounting .
not_available I told you that .
not_available Oh , right .

not_available Are you OK ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available I want to apologize for what happened yesterday .
not_available It's OK .
not_available I should never have lashed out at you like that .
not_available It's just
not_available , I don't know what's wrong with me .
not_available I was holding a saucepan the other day , and , all of a sudden , I remembered making creamed corn in that pan .
not_available Some night when it was raining outside , and both the boys had colds , and my husband was on a call , picking up a body , and then , yesterday , I was cleaning out the cabinets , and I found a jar of baby food in the very backstrained carrots from when Claire was a baby .
not_available That jar had been sitting there for over 15 years .
not_available I am surrounded by these relics of a life that no longer exists .
not_available We're here for the Jones viewing .
not_available Right this way , please .
not_available Yeah ?
not_available Oh , shit , Billy , did I wake you ?
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available Fuck !
not_available Who is this ?
not_available It's Claire .
not_available Who ?
not_available It's Claire , Nate;s sister .
not_available I just wanted to see if maybe you wanted to hang out again after school today .
not_available Not really .
not_available Come on , Claire , you're what ?
not_available What do you think I am , a pedophile ?
not_available Well ?
not_available I don't know what you want me to say .
not_available Well , I don't want you to say anything .
not_available I just thought you should see it .
not_available I've seen it .
not_available So , great !
not_available Dad traded a room for a funeral .
not_available No wonder we never had any money .
not_available Didn't Dad ever say anything to you about this place at all ?
not_available Dad and I never talked about anything but work .
not_available That's exactly the relationship you
not_available and I have .
not_available Nate , people are allowed to have private lives .
not_available So what if Dad had a secret room ?
not_available I don't care .
not_available I don't care if he brought women back here to fuck .
not_available I don't care if he brought men back here to fuck .
not_available You think we should tell Mom about it ?
not_available Sure , why not ?
not_available You won't be happy until this whole family's in therapy .
not_available That's kind of a leap .
not_available Dave , look , I know you're pissed off about a lot of shit , but I didn't make any of that shit happen .
not_available Oh , right , I I abandoned you .
not_available Well , you know what ?
not_available I'm not your father .
not_available I'm not the one whose responsibility it was not to abandon you .
not_available So just get over it , please .
not_available Life is just too fucking short .
not_available Thank you , Nate .
not_available I appreciate your honesty , wrapped as it was in such a bouquet of condescension .
not_available If I were you , I'd pack this place up before they start charging us for rent .
not_available Quite a hottie , huh ?
not_available This is Mom ?
not_available You have no idea how beautiful she was , buddy boy .
not_available I have no idea who you were .
not_available I wasn't really that interesting .
not_available No , I think you probably were .
not_available I think you were this great guy who was funny and weird and high .
not_available I was just always so afraid of everything you did .
not_available Death .
not_available You know , I made the decision to come back home , to become a fucking undertaker , because I thought it was something you believed in , and now I find out you think running away was the best thing I ever did ?
not_available Maybe .
not_available Jesus Christ , I kept us from selling to Kroehner , and I'm taking the Funeral Director's License Test next month .
not_available Well , maybe I was just covering up for how embarrassed I was when you left .
not_available Is that why you left half the business to me ?
not_available To get back at me ?
not_available Maybe .
not_available Maybe I just wanted to see if you had the balls to go against me .
not_available Or maybe I really wanted you to have it .
not_available You'll never know .
not_available Goddamn it , when are you gonna stop fucking with me ?
not_available When are you gonna stop caring what I thought .
not_available " I never knew my father! "
not_available Get over it !
not_available Please !
not_available Life is just too fucking short .
not_available My brother is a very complicated man and very high maintenance .
not_available And , don't get me wrong , I love him dearly , but I pity the woman he ends up with .
not_available See , that's the same thing I'd say about my brother .
not_available Nate is not even in the same league .
not_available Was I crazy ?
not_available I mean , Billy was really acting like
not_available Did you fuck him ?
not_available No .
not_available Well , you dodged a bullet there .
not_available Is every man alive a total asshole ?
not_available At some point or another .
not_available Then , again , so are we .
not_available Come on , we've gotta go .
not_available I still cannot get over the fact that you are
Charlotte Light &amp ;
Charlotte Dark !
Charlotte Well , you have to , because it's very irritating .
not_available Mr .
not_available Jones is still downstairs .
not_available I know this silver has been in your father's family for three generations .
not_available I don't believe I've ever used it .
not_available I'm going to put an ad in the paper and see if I can sell them .
not_available Mom , I found something you should probably have .
not_available Where'd you find these ?
not_available In the office , among Dad's things .
not_available Look at what a child I was !
not_available Your father was leaving for Vietnam .
not_available He'd volunteered as a medic .
not_available Your grandfather was furious !
not_available You don't remember your grandfather , do you ?
not_available No .
not_available He was a very unhappy man , and he wanted everyone else to be unhappy , too .
not_available We were all living in this house .
not_available Well , you were a baby , and there was no privacy , so Nathaniel and I got a room in a motel .
not_available Some seedy place in the Valley .
not_available And we made love like maniacs .
not_available Like it was the last time .
not_available Your father took these pictures , in that damp little room .
not_available Told me he kept them in his pocket in Vietnam to protect him .
not_available It's frightening how much we change .
not_available Are you staying for dinner , dear ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Mr .
not_available Jones ?
not_available Probably should think about heading home .
not_available You've got a long day ahead of you tomorrow .
not_available Funeral .
not_available Mr .
not_available Jones ?
not_available Mr .
not_available Jones ?
not_available Mr .
not_available Jones ?
not_available Oh , shit .

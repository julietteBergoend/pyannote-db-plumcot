brenda_chenowith " I hate this client .
not_available Every time she gets dumped by a guy , she gets a puppy .
not_available So now she's got like 15 dogs , they're all male , they're all huge , and they sit there and watch with their tongues hanging out while I work on her .
not_available It's like being in some live sex show for Asian businessmen , frat boys which I actually did for a while , back in the 80s , make some money .
brenda_chenowith I got this great thing going with ping pong balls you'd really like .
not_available I must show it to you sometime .
not_available Hey , wouldn't it be funny if I got some hedge clippers and cut off your dick ?
brenda_chenowith What ?
brenda_chenowith Do me a favor , OK ?
not_available Don't read that shit in front of me .
brenda_chenowith You gave it to me .
not_available Yeah , come on , I'm late .
not_available I'm at the part with the doll .
not_available Why is your doll angry ?
not_available Because she got raped .
not_available Really ?
not_available By who ?
not_available By you .
young_brenda Brenda , do you know what " raped " means ?
not_available It means she was forced into sexual intercourse against her will .
nate_fisher It's so cool .
not_available You were obviously doing it to scare him into leaving you alone , right ?
not_available What do you want from me ?
not_available I was 8 .
nate_fisher Did it work ?
not_available No , it didn't work .
brenda_chenowith I just got a whole new level of scrutiny by a whole different set of vultures , only this time they were women .
not_available I'm leaving .
not_available You still want a ride ?
not_available You alright ?
not_available Yes , I'm fine .
not_available What are you doing today ?

not_available Seattle .
mechanic Right .
not_available The health food thing .
not_available Yup .
mechanic I remember your dad talked about you .
not_available Sorry to hear about him , man .
nate_fisher He was a funny guy .
not_available Yeah ?
not_available No , you don't pay .
not_available Don't pay ?
not_available Yeah , your dad buried my brother a few years back .
nate_fisher It was in trade .
mechanic My father traded a funeral for oil changes ?

not_available Bye , Mom , have a good day .
mr_jones So would you like us to take care of finding you a cemetery plot , Mr . Jones ?
not_available Yeah , I don't wanna do that .
not_available Would you like a double plot ?
not_available What for ?
not_available Well , one for your wife and one for you .
not_available Next to each other .
mr_jones Is this what you do all the time ?
david_fisher Sell people their own graves ?
david_fisher Well , yes , sir .
not_available This is my job .
not_available Don't try to pull that shit with me , boy .
not_available I want a simple box .
not_available No frills .
mr_jones You can't take advantage of me because I'm old .
david_fisher I'll kick your ass !
not_available Just a single plot , then .
not_available No .
not_available Double plot .
david_fisher Shit .
mr_jones Will you want Mrs . Jones prepared for viewing ?
not_available Yes , I want to see her , but I don't want you messin' with her none .
not_available I don't want you to cut her or stick her or pickle her like an egg .
not_available If you want a viewing , I strongly would recommend That's my wife , boy
not_available , I don't want you to touch her !
not_available Mr .
not_available Jones , I can guarantee that you will not want to see her , nor will anybody else , unless she's been embalmed .
mr_jones I would beg you to consider what your wife would want .
not_available She's dead , fool !
david_fisher Don't matter what she wants !
david_fisher Well , yes , sir , but after death , the body immediately begins to decompose much quicker than you might think .
not_available The skin begins to separate , there's quite an unpleasant odor .
david_fisher Should you choose to forego embalming , my recommendation would be cremation , as soon as possible .
not_available That's just the way it is , Mr . Jones .
not_available I don't want to burn her up .
not_available I want to see her .
not_available Fine .
not_available You do understand , however , that that means she'll have to be embalmed .
not_available I ain't payin' for that .
not_available Sir , the cost is minimal I will waive the embalming fee , Mr . Jones , alright ?
ruth_fisher That was a good sermon , I thought .
not_available Did you ?
not_available You didn't ?
tracy_montrose_blair I didn't really listen to it .

claire_fisher His wife died , and he wanted to see her .
not_available I guess she isn't ready yet .
claire_fisher He looked like he was about to keel over , so I helped him sit down .
claire_fisher Then I had to listen to him bitch and moan about public transportation for fucking ever , and then he just , like , passed out .
not_available Now I can't get his fucking hand to let go !
not_available Maybe he died .
not_available Very funny .

mr_jones I'm sorry about your wife .
nate_fisher You didn't know her .
not_available jessica Wilcox ?
not_available I'm Nate Fisher , Nathaniel's son .
not_available I wondered why I hadn't heard from Nathaniel in quite a while .
jessica_wilcox I hate this .
not_available I hate that I'll never see him again .
nate_fisher He was such a kook !
not_available Kook ?
not_available Dad ?
not_available I don't think anybody made me laugh like that .
not_available He had such a sense of humor .
jessica_wilcox So I hear .
not_available He was really proud of you .
jessica_wilcox I'm Nate , not David .
not_available I know who you are .
jessica_wilcox You're the one who took off .
jessica_wilcox Your father really respected you for that .
not_available Said he wished he'd had the guts to do that when he was a kid .
not_available Ms Wilcox , did you have some kind of arrangement with my father ?
not_available Arrangement ?
not_available In our ledgers , some of the funerals were marked differently , and your mother's was one .
not_available Seems my father sometimes traded his services for payments other than cash .
not_available Please don't take this the wrong way , but can I see some kind of identification ?
not_available Driver?s license would do .
not_available Uh sure .
not_available Libra , huh ?
not_available I would've taken you for a Capricorn .
not_available You drink a lot of coffee up in Seattle ?
jessica_wilcox Yeah .
not_available Better be careful .
not_available Give you kidney stones .
not_available Oh , come on !
not_available Surely you wouldn't begrudge your father such a minor indulgence !
not_available My father never smoked pot .
jessica_wilcox Not in front of you , he didn't .
not_available It's the finest organic .
not_available Grown in San Francisco by my son .
jessica_wilcox Take it .
not_available It's your father's monthly supply .
not_available How is your mother doing with the grieving , David ?
not_available She is fine .
not_available As far as I can tell .
david_fisher You know her .
father_jack She likes to suffer in silence .
not_available That seems to be a family trait .
not_available You know it's God's will for us to live our lives fully .
not_available Breathing in the joy around us , not just shouldering the pain .
not_available God wants us to be happy .
not_available I call them energy buns .
tracy_montrose_blair They're my own recipe .
not_available Well , not really .
not_available Adding the peppers was something I picked up on my honeymoon .
not_available Have you ever been to Brazil ?
not_available no .
not_available Oh my God , Brazilians are the most beautiful people alive .
tracy_montrose_blair They're like these fabulous mongrels who've incorporated all the very best attributes from ever race .
not_available I mean , all that crossbreeding , hello !
tracy_montrose_blair I had a half breed mutt who lived to be almost 20 ,
not_available and then I got this purebred ,
not_available Corky , and its hips disintegrated before it was even 2
indigent_man Here you go .
not_available Fuck you , church freaks !
tracy_montrose_blair Well , enjoy .
tracy_montrose_blair Do you cook ?
not_available I hate cooking just for myself .
not_available That's the worst part about being divorced .
not_available That and the no regular sex thing .
hiram_gunderson Daivd , could I talk to you for a moment ?
not_available Alone .
david_fisher Excuse us .
hiram_gunderson What do you want ?
hiram_gunderson Ruth won't talk to me .
not_available I'm worried about her .
not_available I was hoping that you couldYou were fucking my mother while my father was still alive , and now you want me to I understand if you're upset with me .
david_fisher Understand this .
not_available Whatever you have with my mother is between you and her , but I have no interest in helping you .
nate_fisher Table for one ?

restaurant_owner Your father buried my wife seven years ago .
restaurant_owner I have very little money for the funeral .
not_available He asked if he could have this room as his own , and that would be my settlement .
restaurant_owner What did he do here ?

not_available Sometimes he was here everyday .
not_available Mrs .

not_available Have you been to the website ?
not_available There's a website ?
not_available Oh , yes , there's a fan club .
not_available Yeah , those lonely little girls desperate for something to emulate , because , apparently , they're not original enough to come up with anything on their own .
not_available Well , that's what I like to see .
not_available ing before sundown .

nathaniel_fisher I just have to take a shower .
not_available So , I'm walking along one day , and this asshole stops me and asks if I'm alright .
nathaniel_fisher He says I got a look .
not_available He'd seen a man with that same look once and had ignored it .
not_available And that man had jumped out of a 9 story window .
not_available You know the reconstruction involved in a death like that ?
not_available This business gets under your skin .
not_available It's like a fucking virus .
not_available They can even see it on your face .
not_available Smell it on you .
not_available What the hell is this place ?
not_available This music ?
not_available Since when do you listen to The Classics Four ?
not_available What the hell did you do here ?
not_available Who the hell are you ?
not_available So many questions .
nathaniel_fisher Why couldn't you ask them when I was still ALIVE? ! ?
not_available It's OK .
not_available I couldn't answer most of them , anyway .
not_available Unlike now .
not_available Now , I'm a fucking prophet .
not_available Right .
not_available You think I'm kidding , buddy boy ?
not_available That's one of the perks of being dead .
not_available You know what happens after you're dead , and you know the meaning of life .
nathaniel_fisher That seems fairly useless .
not_available Yeah , I know .
not_available Life is wasted on the living .
not_available Could have told me you were proud of me .
nathaniel_fisher You were never around for me to tell , which is exactly what I was proud of you for .
nate_fisher Therein lies your catch 22 .
not_available So , what's the meaning of life ?
not_available Really wanna know ?
not_available I don't know .
tracy_montrose_blair Will it fuck me up if I do ?

not_available But she broke my heart , and I'm just not ready or interested in any sort of relationship right now .
not_available Oh , come on , any relationship ?
not_available I'm just not ready , and I doubt I will be for quite some time .
not_available Well , what if Cindy Crawford were to walk up to you and say , " Just use me for sex " ?
tracy_montrose_blair I would say no .
not_available Liar .
tracy_montrose_blair Is it so wrong to want a little human contact ?
not_available You're lonely , too .
not_available I can tell .
not_available For Chrissake , Tracy , what does it take ?
not_available No .
not_available Well , you don't have to be so mean about it .
david_fisher Apparently I do .

not_available Do us both a favor .

not_available I will kick your ass .
not_available You do not want to mess with me .

not_available Well , don't that piss you off , boy ?
not_available Not yet .
not_available He used this how long ?
brenda_chenowith Seven years .
nate_fisher It's weird how you keep showing me rooms people used to live in .
not_available I just think it's so fucking weird .
nate_fisher He'd sit in
brenda_chenowith this sad , little room doing God knows what .
not_available Why does it have to be sad ?
not_available Look around .
not_available I think it's fascinating .
not_available Really , why ?
not_available Such a mystery , ya know ?
not_available You'll neverk now what went on here .
brenda_chenowith That's exactly what's driving me crazy .
not_available So what if you did know , had it all explained to you ?
not_available I bet it wouldn't be nearly as interesting or fun .
not_available Your father would be a lot more boring .
nate_fisher Enjoy this !
nate_fisher Come on , don't you pick up on something ?
brenda_chenowith I thought things left marks in people , in places , in time .
not_available So , what , you think I'm a witch ?
brenda_chenowith You really don't get any kind of vibe from this place at all ?
not_available You wanna know what I think ?
not_available I think your father wanted some place that was just his and nobody else's .
not_available Nate , if you didn't know him when he was alive , you never will .
not_available I don't wanna be somebody who when I die nobody knows who I was .
not_available So don't be .
not_available How are you doing , Mr . Jones ?
not_available I'm sitting here , holding my dead wife's hand .

not_available I hope so .
claire_fisher She's pretty amazing .
claire_fisher He'd be a real idiot to let her go .
not_available But again he's capable of being an idiot sometimes .
not_available So what is she to him ?
not_available Just hot sex ?
not_available I think he's really in love with her .
billy_chenowith How could he not be ?

ruth_fisher It's OK .
not_available I should never have lashed out at you like that .
not_available It's just
not_available , I don't know what's wrong with me .
not_available I was holding a saucepan the other day , and , all of a sudden , I remembered making creamed corn in that pan .
not_available Some night when it was raining outside , and both the boys had colds , and my husband was on a call , picking up a body , and then , yesterday , I was cleaning out the cabinets , and I found a jar of baby food in the very backstrained carrots from when Claire was a baby .
not_available That jar had been sitting there for over 15 years .
not_available I am surrounded by these relics of a life that no longer exists .

billy_chenowith Not really .
not_available Come on , Claire , you're what ?
not_available What do you think I am , a pedophile ?
not_available Well ?
nate_fisher I don't know what you want me to say .
nate_fisher Well , I don't want you to say anything .
david_fisher I just thought you should see it .
not_available I've seen it .
not_available So , great !
not_available Dad traded a room for a funeral .
nate_fisher No wonder we never had any money .
not_available Didn't Dad ever say anything to you about this place at all ?
nate_fisher Dad and I never talked about anything but work .
not_available That's exactly the relationship you
not_available and I have .
david_fisher Nate , people are allowed to have private lives .
not_available So what if Dad had a secret room ?
not_available I don't care .
not_available I don't care if he brought women back here to fuck .
not_available I don't care if he brought men back here to fuck .
not_available You think we should tell Mom about it ?
david_fisher Sure , why not ?
not_available You won't be happy until this whole family's in therapy .
not_available That's kind of a leap .
nate_fisher Dave , look , I know you're pissed off about a lot of shit , but I didn't make any of that shit happen .
not_available Oh , right , I I abandoned you .
not_available Well , you know what ?
nate_fisher I'm not your father .
not_available I'm not the one whose responsibility it was not to abandon you .
not_available So just get over it , please .
david_fisher Life is just too fucking short .
david_fisher Thank you , Nate .
david_fisher I appreciate your honesty , wrapped as it was in such a bouquet of condescension .
not_available If I were you , I'd pack this place up before they start charging us for rent .
not_available Quite a hottie , huh ?
nathaniel_fisher This is Mom ?
not_available You have no idea how beautiful she was , buddy boy .
not_available I have no idea who you were .
not_available I wasn't really that interesting .
nate_fisher No , I think you probably were .
not_available I think you were this great guy who was funny and weird and high .
not_available I was just always so afraid of everything you did .
not_available Death .
not_available You know , I made the decision to come back home , to become a fucking undertaker , because I thought it was something you believed in , and now I find out you think running away was the best thing I ever did ?
nate_fisher Maybe .
nathaniel_fisher Jesus Christ , I kept us from selling to Kroehner , and I'm taking the Funeral Director's License Test next month .
not_available Well , maybe I was just covering up for how embarrassed I was when you left .
nate_fisher Is that why you left half the business to me ?
not_available To get back at me ?
not_available Maybe .
nathaniel_fisher Maybe I just wanted to see if you had the balls to go against me .
nathaniel_fisher Or maybe I really wanted you to have it .
nate_fisher You'll never know .
not_available Goddamn it , when are you gonna stop fucking with me ?
not_available When are you gonna stop caring what I thought .
not_available " I never knew my father ! "
nathaniel_fisher Get over it !
not_available Please !
not_available Life is just too fucking short .
not_available My brother is a very complicated man and very high maintenance .
not_available And , don't get me wrong , I love him dearly , but I pity the woman he ends up with .
not_available See , that's the same thing I'd say about my brother .
not_available Nate is not even in the same league .
claire_fisher Was I crazy ?
not_available I mean , Billy was really acting like
not_available Did you fuck him ?
brenda_chenowith No .
not_available Well , you dodged a bullet there .
not_available Is every man alive a total asshole ?
brenda_chenowith At some point or another .
not_available Then , again , so are we .
not_available Come on , we've gotta go .
not_available I still cannot get over the fact that you are
not_available Light &amp ;
brenda_chenowith Dark !
not_available Well , you have to , because it's very irritating .
not_available Mr .
not_available Jones is still downstairs .
ruth_fisher I know this silver has been in your father's family for three generations .
not_available I don't believe I've ever used it .
not_available I'm going to put an ad in the paper and see if I can sell them .
not_available Mom , I found something you should probably have .
nate_fisher Where'd you find these ?
not_available In the office , among Dad's things .
not_available Look at what a child I was !
ruth_fisher Your father was leaving for Vietnam .
not_available He'd volunteered as a medic .
not_available Your grandfather was furious !
not_available You don't remember your grandfather , do you ?
ruth_fisher No .
not_available He was a very unhappy man , and he wanted everyone else to be unhappy , too .
not_available We were all living in this house .
ruth_fisher Well , you were a baby , and there was no privacy , so Nathaniel and I got a room in a motel .
not_available Some seedy place in the Valley .
ruth_fisher And we made love like maniacs .
not_available Like it was the last time .
not_available Your father took these pictures , in that damp little room .
not_available Told me he kept them in his pocket in Vietnam to protect him .
ruth_fisher It's frightening how much we change .

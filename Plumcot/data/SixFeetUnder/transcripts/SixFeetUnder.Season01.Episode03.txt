nate_fisher My dad had all these old big band records .
nate_fisher All this reminds me of being a kid still being blissfully ignorant of what a sick joke life can be .
brenda_chenowith I'd have pegged you as more of a fan of what ?
brenda_chenowith Sting ?
brenda_chenowith U2 ?
brenda_chenowith You know , grew up in the 80s but too straight to be into real hardcore punk stuff .
nate_fisher Oh , yeah ?

brenda_chenowith Kind of .
brenda_chenowith I think it was just the heroine talking

ruth_fisher This oat bran is stuck on here like cement because you didn't soak any water in it , thank you very much .
david_fisher Listen to me .
david_fisher Kroehner is pressuring our suppliers to demand money up front .
david_fisher Now Continental Caskets wants us to pay for anything we put in the showroom before we actually sell it .
david_fisher That's thousands of dollars .
ruth_fisher Your father never let these things <br .
ruth_fisher get to him like you do .
david_fisher Well , he never had to deal with this kind of situation .

ruth_fisher Oh .
david_fisher No one cares where you were .
david_fisher Why do you have to tell people every single thing you do all day ?
nate_fisher Sorry .
nate_fisher I forgot we're supposed to live under a shroud of secrecy
nate_fisher So I think we should sell , and I'm not saying that just because I don't want to have anything to do with this business .
nate_fisher Come on .
nate_fisher Have you looked at their offer ?
nate_fisher That's a lot of money .
nate_fisher Stock options .
david_fisher Do you have any idea how arrogant you are ?
david_fisher You don't get to decide what we're doing .
nate_fisher I own half , Dave .
nate_fisher You haven't spent the last 11 years working here .
david_fisher You didn't give up anything for this .
nate_fisher Well , is this really what you want to be doing with your life , or are you just trying to make a dead man happy ?

nate_fisher Why can't she be a part of this ?

pauline_romano My Tommy was cut up into 50 pieces by a big giant dough mixer .
barbara_romano Oh , Ma , Pop wasn't in that many pieces .
judy_romano Ma , he's gonna look just as you remember him .
judy_romano Right ?
david_fisher@judy_romano Um It says in your brochure you have a gifted restorative artist
judy_romano Whatever Can he make sure Pop looks good enough for an open casket or not ?

david_fisher I'll give you 50 bucks extra A hundred .
federico_diaz I'm the godfather , David .
david_fisher Shit .
david_fisher I can't go because of

federico_diaz So send Nate .
federico_diaz You know , I know he hates this shit , but he's your partner now , right ?
morgue_attendant He's like in a lot of pieces .

claire_fisher so maybe you stayed home because you were tired or something
claire_fisher Anyway , I just wanted to let you know
claire_fisher I was thinking about you and not in any serious way , I was just thinking about you casually .
claire_fisher OK .
claire_fisher Bye .
claire_fisher I wanna kill myself .
#unknown#SixFeetUnder.Season01.Episode03 This Little Piggy Lover , Foot Slut Toe Sucker , and Oink Oink Little Piggy .
david_fisher It's such a fucking easy decision for him .
david_fisher Oh , and Mom takes his side .
david_fisher Big surprise .
david_fisher It's like I don't even exist .
david_fisher Like me giving up law school meant nothing .
keith_charles So fight .
keith_charles If you really want to keep the business , don't give it away .
david_fisher See , that's just it .
david_fisher All day long I've been feeling this incredible sense of relief
david_fisher I don't know if I want to keep it .
david_fisher I could do anything .
david_fisher I'm still young .
david_fisher Right ?
keith_charles You kidding ?
keith_charles You're still a baby .
david_fisher What about that one ?
keith_charles That's a little too Mayberry for me .
keith_charles Something simple and clean , like the ones that hang in the deserted truck stop and that handsome drifter blows into town .
david_fisher Of course .
not_available What about that one ?
keith_charles Not bad .
keith_charles I could see Ava Gardner lying beneath it , plotting to steal Clark Gable away from
keith_charles@david_fisher Grace Kelley People start their lives over all the time , right ?
not_available Yeah .
keith_charles That guy just cruised you .
not_available Really ?
keith_charles Bitch !
keith_charles Right in front of me , like I'm not even here .
david_fisher He did ?
david_fisher And I missed it ?
keith_charles Well , I'm sorry
amelia Oh , Ruth .
ruth_fisher Amelia , another casserole .
amelia Lemon bars .
amelia The kids'll love 'em .
ruth_fisher Don't you have candy striping today ?
amelia I did , but I told them my best friend needed me .
matthew_gilardi You made the right decision .
nate_fisher I know .
nate_fisher I never realized how much money there was to be made in the funeral business .
matthew_gilardi Death care industry .
matthew_gilardi And it's only gonna grow with all the baby boomers and all Wow , gee .
nate_fisher There'll be bodies everywhere .
matthew_gilardi Hopefully .
not_available .
matthew_gilardi and all the final resting places provided by Kroehner .
matthew_gilardi With a little help from Fisher &amp ; Sons .
matthew_gilardi You know , we've had our eyes on your operation for some time .
matthew_gilardi Your father was a nice guy , but he didn't know how to run a business .
nate_fisher Well , my dad was never in it for the money .
nate_fisher I think he was more concerned about , you know , helping people .
matthew_gilardi You wanna help people , join the Peace Corps .
not_available Yeah .
nathaniel_fisher Greedy little Nazi fuck .
nate_fisher So , how exactly will this work ?
matthew_gilardi We won't change the appearance of your unit at all .
matthew_gilardi Maybe a little cosmetic upgrading , perhaps , but preparation of loved ones will now take place at a centralized location which services several other units technicians on staff , constantly producing .
nate_fisher So it's like a little factory of embalming .
matthew_gilardi Preparation for visitation .
matthew_gilardi Now , we maintain a small fleet of vehicles .
nate_fisher Hearses Funeral carriages .
nate_fisher Dead wagons .
matthew_gilardi Removal vans .
matthew_gilardi Once you centralize operations , you'd be amazed how you maximize profits .
nate_fisher So , in the end , we're all just Human McNuggets .
matthew_gilardi Just as we began .
matthew_gilardi I like you , Nate .
nathaniel_fisher You hear that , buddy boy ?
nathaniel_fisher He likes you .
nathaniel_fisher Wow , you are so cool !
matthew_gilardi Your initial payment , sir .
matthew_gilardi The rest will follow after both of our lawyers have held up the process long enough to justify their fees
matthew_gilardi In the meantime , we'd like to send a facilities inspector out to take a look at things as early as next week .
gabe_dimas I'll see ya later .
not_available /
school_boy_1 Yeah , right , later .
not_available Hey .
gabe_dimas what's going on ?

gabe_dimas I I don't know .
claire_fisher You didn't , for instance , blab to your friends that you bagged me , and that I sucked your toes ?
gabe_dimas I might have told 1 person .
gabe_dimas IAndyhe justhe asked me what I did the night before , so I told him
gabe_dimas I mean
gabe_dimas You know , it's not
claire_fisher like I thought this was going to work out , because I know nothing ever works out .
claire_fisher But I guess I just wanted to enjoy this for a little bit .
claire_fisher And instead , the whole world is calling me " this little piggy lover .
gabe_dimas " I'm sorry .
gabe_dimas I'm sorry I Come on , so
gabe_dimas what ?
gabe_dimas So what ?
gabe_dimas So it got out ?
gabe_dimas Who cares ?
claire_fisher You know what I wish ?
claire_fisher I wish that just once people wouldn't act like the cliches that they are .
ruth_fisher This can go to good will .
ruth_fisher And this , and this one too .
ruth_fisher Maybe Nathaniel's clothes are too dull for good will .
ruth_fisher Does good will ever refuse anything ?
amelia Ruth , if you want to cry , cry .
ruth_fisher What are you talking about ?
amelia Just let it out .
amelia That's why I'm here .
ruth_fisher For the last time , I'm fine .
amelia I just think it's very interesting .
amelia You're supposed to be making two piles .
amelia One for good will , and one for memories , and yet you have not held onto one thing .
ruth_fisher The memory pile was your stupid idea .
ruth_fisher What am I supposed to do with Nathaniel's old clothes ?
ruth_fisher Make pillows ?
ruth_fisher A quilt ?
ruth_fisher I mean , how about just burn them all ?
ruth_fisher How can someone with so little clothing have so much clothing ?
amelia What is this ?
ruth_fisher Nothing .
ruth_fisher It's stupid .
amelia Something about visiting the pyramids , taking ballet lessons .
ruth_fisher I wrote down things I might want to do now that I'm have more time .
amelia Well , I think that's wonderful .
ruth_fisher No , it's not .
not_available It's stupid .
ruth_fisher I don't even want to do any of these things .
ruth_fisher I just did it , because some book told me to .
ruth_fisher What am I , going to be in " Swan Lake " ?
amelia Why not ?
amelia You see stories like that on the news all the time .
amelia It's inspiring .
ruth_fisher It's depressing .
ruth_fisher It seems so desperate .
amelia Maybe it's a little desperate .
amelia Besides , who knows ?
amelia It's always possible you might meet a man .
ruth_fisher That part of my life is over .
ruth_fisher You know , you're supposed to flip this mattress every two months .
amelia I do mine every 14 weeks .
ruth_fisher Well , I can't remember ever flipping this
ruth_fisher It's probably been 20 years .
not_available Come on .
ruth_fisher Get up .
amelia You haven't finished going through Nathaniel's clothes .
amelia Ruth .
amelia Ruth !
amelia How can I help you ?
ruth_fisher You can lift this up with me .

david_fisher Oh , no , not at all .
david_fisher We'll keep the business for the rest of the day , then sell it again tomorrow for a few hours .
nate_fisher Just here me out .
david_fisher No , no , this is a good system .
david_fisher We'll sell in the mornings , keep it in the afternoons , and maybe sometimes we sell again in the evenings when we really can't make a decision .
ruth_fisher David , you're not being fair .
david_fisher When I didn't want to sell , you could have cared less .
david_fisher And when Nate doesn't want to sell , you listen .
ruth_fisher OK , I'm a terrible mother who's responsible for all you problems .

ruth_fisher You don't always stick with things .
david_fisher I mean , come on , you can't even stand to be in the same room with a dead body .
nate_fisher I know ,
nate_fisher but there's a reason for that .
nate_fisher This is what I'm supposed to do .
nate_fisher Which is why I've spent so much time running away from it
nate_fisher My whole life , I've been a tourist
nate_fisher Now , I have the chance to do some good instead of just sucking up air .
nate_fisher I know it's a lot to ask of you , I know ,
nate_fisher but I just really think that we can do this You and me .
nate_fisher Together .
nate_fisher Brothers , like we used to be .
david_fisher We could still sell to Kroehner and both manage Fisher &amp ; Sons .
nate_fisher Yeah ,
nate_fisher but then we're just spokesmodels working to make fat Republican stockholders richer
nate_fisher And Kroehner doesn't give a shit about people .
nate_fisher We care .
nate_fisher We can help them through their grief .
nate_fisher That's what we do .
david_fisher This is a business , Nate .
david_fisher It's not a charity .
nate_fisher Well , of course it's a business , but it's more than that , and you know it .
david_fisher OK .
nate_fisher Great .
nate_fisher I'll call Gilardi and tell him he can kiss our collective ass .
ruth_fisher Language !
nate_fisher Maybe Dad knew what he was doing .

brenda_chenowith Gosh .

nate_fisher You know , I'd always wanted to tell off some corporate shit some greedy little Nazi fuck , you know ?
brenda_chenowith That's very hostile .
nate_fisher No , it's very diplomatic .
nate_fisher I just said thanks , but we changed our minds .
brenda_chenowith What did he do ?
nate_fisher He didn't do anything .
nate_fisher What's he gonna do ?
david_fisher This is completely unacceptable .
deadwagon_attendant What can I tell you ?
deadwagon_attendant The Baxters changed their mind
deadwagon_attendant They're going with the Unger Mortuary .
david_fisher Was there a reason ?
morgue_attendant@deadwagon_attendant They probably just underbid you .
david_fisher I know Hal Unger .
david_fisher He never underbid anybody .
deadwagon_attendant Unger moved to Florida .
deadwagon_attendant They were bought out by Kroehner months ago .
deadwagon_attendant Sign here .
nate_fisher You know , I didn't just decide to stay in Los Angeles because of the business .
nate_fisher I had another reason .
brenda_chenowith Oh , please .
brenda_chenowith Don't ruin this .
brenda_chenowith I've got such a nice buzz going .
nate_fisher It was you .
brenda_chenowith Nate , get serious .

nate_fisher It's true .
brenda_chenowith No , it's not .
brenda_chenowith You're staying here because you found something that you want to do .
brenda_chenowith I am the extra bonus that probably won't work out .
nate_fisher Sometimes your honesty gets really tiresome .
brenda_chenowith I don't want any children .
nate_fisher Whoa , who said anything about children ?
brenda_chenowith I was referring to you .
nate_fisher Aah .
brenda_chenowith I got something for you .

matthew_gilardi Morning , Nate .
matthew_gilardi Lovely day , isn't it ?
nate_fisher I've seen better .
matthew_gilardi I only wanted to say hello , seeing that I'm your new neighbor .
matthew_gilardi We just bought that house across the street .
matthew_gilardi Got it for a song , too .
matthew_gilardi Oh , and by the way , we're planning to put you out of business in six months .
david_fisher They're opening a Poseidon Society across the street? ! ?
nate_fisher That's right .
nate_fisher What is a Poseidon Society ?
david_fisher They sell cremations .
david_fisher Cheap cremations .
david_fisher Now for a fraction of what we charge , you can now dump off the relative you never really liked anyway at the Torch Mart across the street .
nate_fisher I guess we have to just continue to do our best .
david_fisher And how exactly do we do that ?
david_fisher You know , Lu , the florist , that sweet old guy ?
david_fisher He just upped what he charges us by 200% .
david_fisher And that chemical dealer on Figaro is now suing us over some non existent shipment of cavity fluid .
david_fisher And every other supplier that we have in common with Kroehner has suddenly developed some sort of problem with Fisher and Sons .
david_fisher For some unknown reason by the name of Kroehner , the health department is going to inspect us next week .
nate_fisher Yeah , so what ?
nate_fisher Isn't everything clean ?
david_fisher Yes , but any inspection means we have to update something .
david_fisher If it's the ventilation system , we're sunk .
david_fisher We should've sold .
federico_diaz Uh , Nate .
federico_diaz I'm having a problem .
federico_diaz You don't happen to have Mr .
federico_diaz Romano's foot on you , do you ?
david_fisher Do you remember picking up the foot ?
nate_fisher I think so , but my eyes were shut , and I was trying not to vomit .
david_fisher I'm not happy .
nate_fisher Well , that's very interesting , David , because I'm ecstatic !
nate_fisher Maybe the morgue never gave us that foot .
federico_diaz Both feet are listed in the paperwork , Nate .
david_fisher Just think , Nate .
david_fisher Is there any other point you could have lost it ?
ruth_fisher Lost what ?
david_fisher Nothing .
ruth_fisher If you lost something , look under the bed .
ruth_fisher That's where things always turn up .
nate_fisher I doubt that applies in this case .
ruth_fisher That's what people always say , then they find whatever it is they're looking for under the bed .
david_fisher Mom , we're really busy down here .
ruth_fisher The upstairs machine is broken .
ruth_fisher I called the repairman , but Oh my God , what is this? ! ?
ruth_fisher Someone left the Kleenex in their pocket , and now it's all over everything .
ruth_fisher Disgusting !
david_fisher Nate , retrace your steps .
david_fisher Is there any other point you could have lost the foot ?
nate_fisher I almost dropped him at the morgue , but the bag didn't open .
nate_fisher I tripped on the stairs , but nothing fell out .
nate_fisher I banged him into the freezer nothing .
nate_fisher Spilled him on the floor ,
federico_diaz but And I picked him up off the floor .
nate_fisher It should be here .
david_fisher I'd say it's an 8 million dollar lawsuit .
federico_diaz At least .
school_boy_1 Hey , you like my new shoes ?
school_boy_1 They're size 12 !
school_boy_2 Toe slut !
ruth_fisher Amelia ?

pauline_romano I'd like to see him .
nate_fisher I'm sorry .
nate_fisher Our enbalmer is a little on the artistic side .
nate_fisher He gets crazy if he has any " input .
david_fisher " It's best to wait until we're completely done .
barbara_romano One more thing .
barbara_romano His shoes .
judy_romano What are you , an idiot ?
barbara_romano Those are his favorite shoes .
judy_romano He has perfectly comfortable loafers .
judy_romano Which would be much more appropriate .
david_fisher Yes , I myself have loafers , which are just like walking on air .
nate_fisher We should have just told them the truth .
david_fisher Mmm .
david_fisher Sorry , Mrs . Romano , but my idiot of a brother lost a part of your husband .
david_fisher Yeah , that woulda worked .
nate_fisher Where are you going ?
david_fisher I have some place I have to be .
david_fisher When I return , I hope to be greeted by a foot , a solution as to how to stop a billion dollar corporation from putting us out of business , and pruned hedges .
amelia Now , aren't you glad you got out of the house ?
ruth_fisher Yes , this is just what I needed .
amelia We should try to get a seat right down front .
ruth_fisher I'm placing a bet .
amelia No , we should just try to enjoy the day .
amelia I don't see why we need to gamble .
amelia They're sweet .
ruth_fisher You both look so happy .
newlywed_man It's an act .
ruth_fisher Just enjoy it while it lasts , which isn't very long .
newlywed_man Excuse me ?
ruth_fisher You think you have forever , but you don't .
ruth_fisher Soon you start to get on each other's nerves , then you don't tell the other person as much as you used to , because , really , what's the point ?
ruth_fisher You thought they understood you , but they never did , not really .
amelia Ruth /
ruth_fisher Finally , not only do you not tell the other person anything real .
ruth_fisher You actively start lying to him .
ruth_fisher And then when you think it can't get any worse , he up and dies !
newlywed_man I think I see a shorter line over there .
#unknown#SixFeetUnder.Season01.Episode03 Bye .

amelia Ruth , Ruth , why did you come here today ?
ruth_fisher To have fun .
ruth_fisher Aren't you having fun? ! ?
david_fisher I think it's wobbling .
keith_charles It's not wobbling .
keith_charles It just looks like it's wobbling , because you've been staring at it for so long .
david_fisher No , it's definitely wobbling .
keith_charles You're hallucinating .
david_fisher Life is strange .
david_fisher Just one of those tiny screws isn't screwed on tight enough , that thing could fall and kill us instantaneously , just chop us to bits like a cuisinart .
keith_charles Yeah , an assassin with a semi automatic could walk through the door and spray our brains all over the place .
david_fisher The sun could become a supernova and engulf the entire planet in flames .
david_fisher David Fisher .
federico_diaz Yeah , we just got a call from Claire's school .
federico_diaz She's in trouble .
david_fisher Can't Mom handle this ?

david_fisher Until then , tell Nate
david_fisher Oh , great , he's MIA , too ?

keith_charles Shut the fuck up .
david_fisher She did it .
david_fisher I know she did .
keith_charles Where's the foot now ?
david_fisher I don't know .
david_fisher The student who supposedly found it now denies that it ever happened .
keith_charles OK , where's your sister ?
david_fisher No one knows .
david_fisher A police report has been filed , and now Mom is supposed to meet with the principal at 9 tomorrow .
david_fisher I don't understand kids .
david_fisher When I was her age , I never would have taken a foot .
keith_charles David , I can help .
keith_charles I'm a cop .
keith_charles That's what I do for a living .
david_fisher You find feet? ! ?
gabe_dimas What the fuck am I gonna do ?
brenda_chenowith Tell me who lived here again .
nate_fisher The Fritzens .

nate_fisher Jeannie Fritzen and I used to play here after school .
nate_fisher Both her parents worked .
nate_fisher Brenda , this is serious .
nate_fisher My entire family could go bankrupt .
brenda_chenowith So , swallow your pride , go back to the corporation , and sell .
nate_fisher They cut their offer in half now that they know we're so quick to buckle under .
nate_fisher Plus , I really don't wanna let that greedy little Nazi win .

nate_fisher I lost someone's foot today .

nate_fisher I really thought I had like this profound revelation .
nate_fisher Fuck , if this isn't what I'm supposed to be doing with my life , then what is ?
brenda_chenowith Living it .
brenda_chenowith And you're doing that so relaxed .
nate_fisher You really don't give a fuck what I'm going through , do you ?
not_available Sure .
brenda_chenowith As much as I can , given we've known each other less than a month .
brenda_chenowith There's no big investment .
brenda_chenowith I mean that's part of the appeal for both of us .
brenda_chenowith Right ?
not_available Right ?
nate_fisher Jeannie Fritzen tried to kiss me in this room .
nate_fisher I wouldn't let her .
brenda_chenowith You can't control things .
brenda_chenowith@nate_fisher Nobody can . / Shut up .
brenda_chenowith There's only one thing that's
brenda_chenowith certain : Everything changes .
nate_fisher / Shut up .
gabe_dimas I already talked to the other cops .
gabe_dimas I mean , I don't understand why I have to go through this again .
keith_charles Because this time , I want the truth .
gabe_dimas Man /
keith_charles Now , a witness already said she saw you running down the hall screaming the crazy funeral home girl put a foot in your locker .
gabe_dimas It was a joke .
gabe_dimas OK ?
gabe_dimas It was just a joke .
gabe_dimas She's just this girl who's kind of a loser , and we all pick on her , you know ?
gabe_dimas She totally asked for it .
keith_charles You know , modern technology's really something .
gabe_dimas I don't care , man .
keith_charles You should .
keith_charles We now have chemicals we can put on our hands to tell if you've touched human remains .
gabe_dimas No way .
keith_charles You wanna tell me what really happened today ?
gabe_dimas Who's that ?
keith_charles That's my partner .
keith_charles You'd better be glad you don't have to mess with him .
keith_charles That guy's into some crazy ass shit .

ruth_fisher I was up $9000 , and then I started to lose ,
ruth_fisher and then I started to feel like me again , and so I kept betting more and more and more and losing more and more .
nate_fisher You should have been more careful .
ruth_fisher I don't wanna be careful .
ruth_fisher I wanna feel alive .
nate_fisher There should be a way to do that that's a little less expensive .

keith_charles Describe it to me again .
claire_fisher It's a foot .
keith_charles Why did you take it in the first place ?
claire_fisher Well , at the time , it seemed like a good way to pay him back for something .
claire_fisher I just wanted to shake him up .
claire_fisher I don't understand how guys can be so unshakable .
keith_charles I know what you mean .

federico_diaz So there was no baby christening the other day .
federico_diaz I lied .
federico_diaz I only took one meeting with Gilardi .

keith_charles He's funny .
keith_charles I know he can be a little uptight , but underneath that , he's such a little boy .
keith_charles Innocent .
keith_charles And I like that .
keith_charles Most of the men I meet , well they kind of just want me to be one thing .
claire_fisher Like what ?
claire_fisher Big black sex cop ?
claire_fisher Sorry , I was speeding , officer .
claire_fisher Guess you have to punish me now .
not_available Yeah .
keith_charles And I don't wanna be that .

keith_charles When someone sees you as you really are and wants to be with you , that's powerful .
claire_fisher Whatever .
claire_fisher I wish I could know the David you know .
keith_charles You could be a little nicer to him .
keith_charles He's under a lot of stress with that cremation place opening across the street .
claire_fisher What cremation place ?
ruth_fisher She stole a foot ?
ruth_fisher From a person ?

david_fisher The cop .
david_fisher I asked him to help out .
claire_fisher He says he's gonna see what he can do about there not being an official report .
ruth_fisher Why does this person have to be so involved in our life ?
nate_fisher Claire , we should probably talk about getting you some help .
claire_fisher You're not my father .
claire_fisher If you need a project , get a dog .
claire_fisher Keith says the school's probably gonna make me see a shrink , anyway .
ruth_fisher Oh , dear !

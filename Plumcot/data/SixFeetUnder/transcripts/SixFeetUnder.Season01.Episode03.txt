not_available OK , this here's the dough mixer .
not_available You gotta get in there , really scrub
not_available it Hose it down every night .
not_available keep the bugs out .
not_available Somebody found a roach in a loaf of whole wheat once and sued Can't you just spray with Raid ?
not_available And then you got bug poisoned bread that might kill 100 people
not_available Is that good ?
not_available Oh , Jesus I gotta get to my chiropractor .
not_available Hey .
not_available Think anyone's ever had sex in here ?
not_available Now , why the fuck would you even think that , huh ?
not_available Romano ?
not_available Ro. .
not_available Romano ?
not_available Romano ?
not_available You Are OK ? "
not_available , That was you made the weirdest noise back there .
not_available I
not_available if were you , I would not get into the weird noise contest .
not_available Oh , yeah ?
not_available I love this song .
not_available This ?
not_available Really ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available My dad had all these old big band records .
not_available All this reminds me of being a kid still being blissfully ignorant of what a sick joke life can be .
not_available I'd have pegged you as more of a fan of what ?
not_available Sting ?
not_available U2 ?
not_available You know , grew up in the 80s but too straight to be into real hardcore punk stuff .
not_available Oh , yeah ?
not_available And I suppose you were into the really hardcore punk stuff ?
not_available Kind of .
not_available I think it was just the heroine talking
not_available Oh man , I love that look !
not_available I really have to go .
not_available Mom and David and I are having some sort of family meeting to discuss whether we should sell the business to Kroehner .
not_available Oh , God , I hope we will .
not_available Why ?
not_available So I can get the hell out of here and go back to Seattle .
not_available Why don't you come with me ?
not_available Why on earth would I want to do something like that ?
not_available Because you are my woman .
not_available You're out of your mind .
not_available Oh , yeah ?
not_available How come my name's branded on your ass ?
not_available I love that look .
not_available You don't understand how serious this is .
not_available We're under siege by a major corporation .
not_available Stop being so dramatic .
not_available Mom , it's a fact .
not_available David , we all have problems .
not_available This oat bran is stuck on here like cement because you didn't soak any water in it , thank you very much .
not_available Listen to me .
not_available Kroehner is pressuring our suppliers to demand money up front .
not_available Now Continental Caskets wants us to pay for anything we put in the showroom before we actually sell it .
not_available That's thousands of dollars .
not_available Your father never let these things <br .
not_available get to him like you do .
not_available Well , he never had to deal with this kind of situation .
not_available I'm sure things will work out .
not_available They always do .
not_available No , they don't .
not_available Good morning .
not_available What's going on with you ?
not_available Nothing Oooh , what a little moonlight can dooo oo .
not_available Dooo oo .
not_available Oooh , Oooh , what a little moonlight can do to you .
not_available Do to you .
not_available You're in love
not_available You're not leaving here till you put some food in your stomach .
not_available Oh , I'm starving .
not_available Are you bulimic ?
not_available Is that what we're going to have to deal with now ?
not_available Mom , apparently you want a child with an eating disorder .
not_available Morning .
not_available How was your run ?
not_available I haven't gone yet .
not_available I stayed over at Brenda's last night .
not_available Oh .
not_available No one cares where you were .
not_available Why do you have to tell people every single thing you do all day ?
not_available Sorry .
not_available I forgot we're supposed to live under a shroud of secrecy
not_available So I think we should sell , and I'm not saying that just because I don't want to have anything to do with this business .
not_available Come on .
not_available Have you looked at their offer ?
not_available That's a lot of money .
not_available Stock options .
not_available Do you have any idea how arrogant you are ?
not_available You don't get to decide what we're doing .
not_available I own half , Dave .
not_available You haven't spent the last 11 years working here .
not_available You didn't give up anything for this .
not_available Well , is this really what you want to be doing with your life , or are you just trying to make a dead man happy ?
not_available We should have this conversation later .
not_available Why can't she be a part of this ?
not_available Thank you .
not_available Nate , this is all I know .
not_available So stay and run the place for Kroehner Or go to law school like you always wanted .
not_available Take my trust fund .
not_available I'll take the cash .
not_available I think Nate's right .
not_available Who knows how long any of us has left ?
not_available We should do what makes us happy .
not_available Fine .
not_available Sell .
not_available What do I care ?
not_available You mean it ?
not_available Sure .
not_available Let's just invalidate my entire life .
not_available I'll go to Gilardi today and tell him our decision .
not_available Choice .
not_available / I don't know .
not_available I guess the one with the satin interior .
not_available Ma , there were like five with satin material .
not_available Let's just go with the Classic Regal .
not_available I like the White Pearl .
not_available Classic Regal will be fine .
not_available Who cares anyway ?
not_available My Tommy was cut up into 50 pieces by a big giant dough mixer .
not_available Oh , Ma , Pop wasn't in that many pieces .
not_available Ma , he's gonna look just as you remember him .
not_available Right ?
not_available Um It says in your brochure you have a gifted restorative artist
not_available Whatever Can he make sure Pop looks good enough for an open casket or not ?
not_available Because , you know , we'll go elsewhere .
not_available You'll be completely satisfied with our work
not_available I guarantee it .
not_available Humpty Dumpty , huh ?
not_available Train tracks ?
not_available Uh dough mixer .
not_available Can you go to St .
not_available Joseph's to pick him up ?
not_available Not today .
not_available It's my cousin
not_available Ramone's baby's christening .
not_available I told you about this .
not_available I'll give you 50 bucks extra A hundred .
not_available I'm the godfather , David .
not_available Shit .
not_available I can't go because of
not_available Mrs . Bond's viewing , and I can't call the service , because Kronauer told Marty if he does our pickups , he'll lose all their business .
not_available So send Nate .
not_available You know , I know he hates this shit , but he's your partner now , right ?
not_available He's like in a lot of pieces .
not_available Humpty Dumpty , I know .
not_available Careful , that could be his head .
not_available Jesus . /
not_available Or his pelvis .
not_available Aah , it's probably his head
not_available So what happened to Rico ?
not_available He get canned ?
not_available No , he's just busy .
not_available You new over there ?
not_available Nope .
not_available I'm just a temp .
not_available I heard Old Man Fisher kicked .
not_available You know him ?
not_available Not really .
not_available Hey , no offense , pal .
not_available You might want to call your agency and ask for a new assignment I'm already on it .
not_available Hey , Gabe .
not_available I looked for you in the quad this morning , but I didn't see you
not_available so maybe you stayed home because you were tired or something
not_available Anyway , I just wanted to let you know
not_available I was thinking about you and not in any serious way , I was just thinking about you casually .
not_available OK .
not_available Bye .
not_available I wanna kill myself .
not_available This Little Piggy Lover , Foot Slut Toe Sucker , and Oink Oink Little Piggy .
not_available It's such a fucking easy decision for him .
not_available Oh , and Mom takes his side .
not_available Big surprise .
not_available It's like I don't even exist .
not_available Like me giving up law school meant nothing .
not_available So fight .
not_available If you really want to keep the business , don't give it away .
not_available See , that's just it .
not_available All day long I've been feeling this incredible sense of relief
not_available I don't know if I want to keep it .
not_available I could do anything .
not_available I'm still young .
not_available Right ?
not_available You kidding ?
not_available You're still a baby .
not_available What about that one ?
not_available That's a little too Mayberry for me .
not_available Something simple and clean , like the ones that hang in the deserted truck stop and that handsome drifter blows into town .
not_available Of course .
not_available What about that one ?
not_available Not bad .
not_available I could see Ava Gardner lying beneath it , plotting to steal Clark Gable away from
not_available Grace Kelley People start their lives over all the time , right ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available That guy just cruised you .
not_available Really ?
not_available Bitch !
not_available Right in front of me , like I'm not even here .
not_available He did ?
not_available And I missed it ?
not_available Well , I'm sorry
not_available Oh , Ruth .
not_available Amelia , another casserole .
not_available Lemon bars .
not_available The kids'll love 'em .
not_available Don't you have candy striping today ?
not_available I did , but I told them my best friend needed me .
not_available You made the right decision .
not_available I know .
not_available I never realized how much money there was to be made in the funeral business .
not_available Death care industry .
not_available And it's only gonna grow with all the baby boomers and all Wow , gee .
not_available There'll be bodies everywhere .
not_available Hopefully.
not_available .
not_available and all the final resting places provided by Kroehner .
not_available With a little help from Fisher &amp ; Sons .
not_available You know , we've had our eyes on your operation for some time .
not_available Your father was a nice guy , but he didn't know how to run a business .
not_available Well , my dad was never in it for the money .
not_available I think he was more concerned about , you know , helping people .
not_available You wanna help people , join the Peace Corps .
not_available Yeah .
not_available Greedy little Nazi fuck .
not_available So , how exactly will this work ?
not_available We won't change the appearance of your unit at all .
not_available Maybe a little cosmetic upgrading , perhaps , but preparation of loved ones will now take place at a centralized location which services several other units technicians on staff , constantly producing .
not_available So it's like a little factory of embalming .
not_available Preparation for visitation .
not_available Now , we maintain a small fleet of vehicles .
not_available Hearses Funeral carriages .
not_available Dead wagons .
not_available Removal vans .
not_available Once you centralize operations , you'd be amazed how you maximize profits .
not_available So , in the end , we're all just Human McNuggets .
not_available Just as we began .
not_available I like you , Nate .
not_available You hear that , buddy boy ?
not_available He likes you .
not_available Wow , you are so cool !
not_available Your initial payment , sir .
not_available The rest will follow after both of our lawyers have held up the process long enough to justify their fees
not_available In the meantime , we'd like to send a facilities inspector out to take a look at things as early as next week .
not_available I'll see ya later .
not_available /
not_available Yeah , right , later .
not_available Hey .
not_available what's going on ?
not_available Fucking asshole .
not_available Why is my car covered with words like " toe sucker " ?
not_available I I don't know .
not_available You didn't , for instance , blab to your friends that you bagged me , and that I sucked your toes ?
not_available I might have told 1 person .
not_available IAndyhe justhe asked me what I did the night before , so I told him
not_available I mean
not_available You know , it's not
not_available like I thought this was going to work out , because I know nothing ever works out .
not_available But I guess I just wanted to enjoy this for a little bit .
not_available And instead , the whole world is calling me " this little piggy lover .
not_available " I'm sorry .
not_available I'm sorry I Come on , so
not_available what ?
not_available So what ?
not_available So it got out ?
not_available Who cares ?
not_available You know what I wish ?
not_available I wish that just once people wouldn't act like the cliches that they are .
not_available This can go to good will .
not_available And this , and this one too .
not_available Maybe Nathaniel's clothes are too dull for good will .
not_available Does good will ever refuse anything ?
not_available Ruth , if you want to cry , cry .
not_available What are you talking about ?
not_available Just let it out .
not_available That's why I'm here .
not_available For the last time , I'm fine .
not_available I just think it's very interesting .
not_available You're supposed to be making two piles .
not_available One for good will , and one for memories , and yet you have not held onto one thing .
not_available The memory pile was your stupid idea .
not_available What am I supposed to do with Nathaniel's old clothes ?
not_available Make pillows ?
not_available A quilt ?
not_available I mean , how about just burn them all ?
not_available How can someone with so little clothing have so much clothing ?
not_available What is this ?
not_available Nothing .
not_available It's stupid .
not_available Something about visiting the pyramids , taking ballet lessons .
not_available I wrote down things I might want to do now that I'm have more time .
not_available Well , I think that's wonderful .
not_available No , it's not .
not_available It's stupid .
not_available I don't even want to do any of these things .
not_available I just did it , because some book told me to .
not_available What am I , going to be in " Swan Lake " ?
not_available Why not ?
not_available You see stories like that on the news all the time .
not_available It's inspiring .
not_available It's depressing .
not_available It seems so desperate .
not_available Maybe it's a little desperate .
not_available Besides , who knows ?
not_available It's always possible you might meet a man .
not_available That part of my life is over .
not_available You know , you're supposed to flip this mattress every two months .
not_available I do mine every 14 weeks .
not_available Well , I can't remember ever flipping this
not_available It's probably been 20 years .
not_available Come on .
not_available Get up .
not_available You haven't finished going through Nathaniel's clothes .
not_available Ruth .
not_available Ruth !
not_available How can I help you ?
not_available You can lift this up with me .
not_available An uncovered mattress is so sad .
not_available Help me turn this over .
not_available Does it feel any different ?
not_available No .
not_available Save our park !
not_available Save our park !
not_available No more money for politicians , money for parks , " Live and let play
not_available " " Save our city's green spaces " " Think of our children " " Sellout " "
not_available Take the Money and Run " "
not_available Go back to Seattle , bag boy " " You fucking moron .
not_available " What are you doing ?
not_available You have a gift .
not_available You can help people .
not_available Fine .
not_available Go back to peddling soy milk and nailing waitresses
not_available What do I care ?
not_available I'm dead .
not_available Move it , asshole !
not_available So now you don't want to sell ?
not_available I know it sounds crazy .
not_available Oh , no , not at all .
not_available We'll keep the business for the rest of the day , then sell it again tomorrow for a few hours .
not_available Just here me out .
not_available No , no , this is a good system .
not_available We'll sell in the mornings , keep it in the afternoons , and maybe sometimes we sell again in the evenings when we really can't make a decision .
not_available David , you're not being fair .
not_available When I didn't want to sell , you could have cared less .
not_available And when Nate doesn't want to sell , you listen .
not_available OK , I'm a terrible mother who's responsible for all you problems .
not_available Happy ?
not_available So what ?
not_available You had some revelation and now you want to be a funeral director .
not_available How long is that going to last ?
not_available He does have a point , Nate .
not_available You don't always stick with things .
not_available I mean , come on , you can't even stand to be in the same room with a dead body .
not_available I know ,
not_available but there's a reason for that .
not_available This is what I'm supposed to do .
not_available Which is why I've spent so much time running away from it
not_available My whole life , I've been a tourist
not_available Now , I have the chance to do some good instead of just sucking up air .
not_available I know it's a lot to ask of you , I know ,
not_available but I just really think that we can do this You and me .
not_available Together .
not_available Brothers , like we used to be .
not_available We could still sell to Kroehner and both manage Fisher &amp ; Sons .
not_available Yeah ,
not_available but then we're just spokesmodels working to make fat Republican stockholders richer
not_available And Kroehner doesn't give a shit about people .
not_available We care .
not_available We can help them through their grief .
not_available That's what we do .
not_available This is a business , Nate .
not_available It's not a charity .
not_available Well , of course it's a business , but it's more than that , and you know it .
not_available OK .
not_available Great .
not_available I'll call Gilardi and tell him he can kiss our collective ass .
not_available Language !
not_available Maybe Dad knew what he was doing .
not_available You really did not have to waste this stuff on me .
not_available Oh , please , my parents got a case of it from some TV movie
not_available they were technical advisors on .
not_available Some serial killer thing for cable .
not_available Oh , they're such whores !
not_available They'll do anything .
not_available Gosh .
not_available Do you believe this stuff is expensive ?
not_available You know , I'd always wanted to tell off some corporate shit some greedy little Nazi fuck , you know ?
not_available That's very hostile .
not_available No , it's very diplomatic .
not_available I just said thanks , but we changed our minds .
not_available What did he do ?
not_available He didn't do anything .
not_available What's he gonna do ?
not_available This is completely unacceptable .
not_available What can I tell you ?
not_available The Baxters changed their mind
not_available They're going with the Unger Mortuary .
not_available Was there a reason ?
not_available They probably just underbid you .
not_available I know Hal Unger .
not_available He never underbid anybody .
not_available Unger moved to Florida .
not_available They were bought out by Kroehner months ago .
not_available Sign here .
not_available You know , I didn't just decide to stay in Los Angeles because of the business .
not_available I had another reason .
not_available Oh , please .
not_available Don't ruin this .
not_available I've got such a nice buzz going .
not_available It was you .
not_available Nate , get serious .
not_available /
not_available It's true .
not_available No , it's not .
not_available You're staying here because you found something that you want to do .
not_available I am the extra bonus that probably won't work out .
not_available Sometimes your honesty gets really tiresome .
not_available I don't want any children .
not_available Whoa , who said anything about children ?
not_available I was referring to you .
not_available /
not_available Aah .
not_available I got something for you .
not_available Open it .
not_available Glen Miller Orchestra at the Hollywood Palladium .
not_available Brenda , this is so cool !
not_available I've never been to the Palladium .
not_available You grew up in L.A. , and you've never been to the Palladium ?
not_available That's pathetic .
not_available Hey , this is for three weeks from now .
not_available How'd you know I wouldn't be in Seattle ?
not_available I didn't .
not_available Good morning , Rico .
not_available Just what I need .
not_available Another boss breathing down my neck .
not_available Hey , put me to work .
not_available Hello ?
not_available The pregnancy's kicked Vanessa's hormones into overload .
not_available I gotta go talk her down .
not_available Look , if you really want to help , take Mr .
not_available Romano out of the bag and put him on the table .
not_available And remember , breathe through your mouth , man .
not_available He's pretty ripe .
not_available Oh , Christ .
not_available Nate ? /
not_available Great .
not_available Look what you made me do !
not_available Oh , gross .
not_available I want to talk to you about something .
not_available I don't know if you noticed
not_available but I'm a little busy right now , swimming in a man's guts .
not_available I don't know what this is .
not_available I'm picking up a part of a person , and I don't even know what part it is !
not_available Fine .
not_available I'll I'll talk to you later .
not_available Oh , God .
not_available Sorry .
not_available What the hell are you doing ?
not_available I work here now .
not_available I have to be a part of things .
not_available Let Rico take care of him .
not_available I have a job for you that's much better suited to your particular talents .
not_available Morning , Nate .
not_available Lovely day , isn't it ?
not_available I've seen better .
not_available I only wanted to say hello , seeing that I'm your new neighbor .
not_available We just bought that house across the street .
not_available Got it for a song , too .
not_available Oh , and by the way , we're planning to put you out of business in six months .
not_available They're opening a Poseidon Society across the street?! ?
not_available That's right .
not_available What is a Poseidon Society ?
not_available They sell cremations .
not_available Cheap cremations .
not_available Now for a fraction of what we charge , you can now dump off the relative you never really liked anyway at the Torch Mart across the street .
not_available I guess we have to just continue to do our best .
not_available And how exactly do we do that ?
not_available You know , Lu , the florist , that sweet old guy ?
not_available He just upped what he charges us by 200% .
not_available And that chemical dealer on Figaro is now suing us over some non existent shipment of cavity fluid .
not_available And every other supplier that we have in common with Kroehner has suddenly developed some sort of problem with Fisher and Sons .
not_available For some unknown reason by the name of Kroehner , the health department is going to inspect us next week .
not_available Yeah , so what ?
not_available Isn't everything clean ?
not_available Yes , but any inspection means we have to update something .
not_available If it's the ventilation system , we're sunk .
not_available We should've sold .
not_available Uh , Nate .
not_available I'm having a problem .
not_available You don't happen to have Mr .
not_available Romano's foot on you , do you ?
not_available Do you remember picking up the foot ?
not_available I think so , but my eyes were shut , and I was trying not to vomit .
not_available I'm not happy .
not_available Well , that's very interesting , David , because I'm ecstatic !
not_available Maybe the morgue never gave us that foot .
not_available Both feet are listed in the paperwork , Nate .
not_available Just think , Nate .
not_available Is there any other point you could have lost it ?
not_available Lost what ?
not_available Nothing .
not_available If you lost something , look under the bed .
not_available That's where things always turn up .
not_available I doubt that applies in this case .
not_available That's what people always say , then they find whatever it is they're looking for under the bed .
not_available Mom , we're really busy down here .
not_available The upstairs machine is broken .
not_available I called the repairman , but Oh my God , what is this?! ?
not_available Someone left the Kleenex in their pocket , and now it's all over everything .
not_available Disgusting !
not_available Nate , retrace your steps .
not_available Is there any other point you could have lost the foot ?
not_available I almost dropped him at the morgue , but the bag didn't open .
not_available I tripped on the stairs , but nothing fell out .
not_available I banged him into the freezer nothing .
not_available Spilled him on the floor ,
not_available but And I picked him up off the floor .
not_available It should be here .
not_available I'd say it's an 8 million dollar lawsuit .
not_available At least .
not_available Hey , you like my new shoes ?
not_available They're size 12 !
not_available Toe slut !
not_available Amelia ?
not_available It's me , Ruth .
not_available Your best friend needs help .
not_available Is he all put together ?
not_available Oh , he's 100% there .
not_available Absolutely .
not_available I'd like to see him .
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available Our enbalmer is a little on the artistic side .
not_available He gets crazy if he has any " input .
not_available " It's best to wait until we're completely done .
not_available One more thing .
not_available His shoes .
not_available What are you , an idiot ?
not_available Those are his favorite shoes .
not_available He has perfectly comfortable loafers .
not_available Which would be much more appropriate .
not_available Yes , I myself have loafers , which are just like walking on air .
not_available We should have just told them the truth .
not_available Mmm .
not_available Sorry , Mrs . Romano , but my idiot of a brother lost a part of your husband .
not_available Yeah , that woulda worked .
not_available Where are you going ?
not_available I have some place I have to be .
not_available When I return , I hope to be greeted by a foot , a solution as to how to stop a billion dollar corporation from putting us out of business , and pruned hedges .
not_available Now , aren't you glad you got out of the house ?
not_available Yes , this is just what I needed .
not_available We should try to get a seat right down front .
not_available I'm placing a bet .
not_available No , we should just try to enjoy the day .
not_available I don't see why we need to gamble .
not_available They're sweet .
not_available You both look so happy .
not_available It's an act .
not_available Just enjoy it while it lasts , which isn't very long .
not_available Excuse me ?
not_available You think you have forever , but you don't .
not_available Soon you start to get on each other's nerves , then you don't tell the other person as much as you used to , because , really , what's the point ?
not_available You thought they understood you , but they never did , not really .
not_available Ruth /
not_available Finally , not only do you not tell the other person anything real .
not_available You actively start lying to him .
not_available And then when you think it can't get any worse , he up and dies !
not_available I think I see a shorter line over there .
not_available Bye .
not_available No matter what you do , you end up alone , not knowing who you are , or what you really want .
not_available Ruth , Ruth , why did you come here today ?
not_available To have fun .
not_available Aren't you having fun?! ?
not_available I think it's wobbling .
not_available It's not wobbling .
not_available It just looks like it's wobbling , because you've been staring at it for so long .
not_available No , it's definitely wobbling .
not_available You're hallucinating .
not_available Life is strange .
not_available Just one of those tiny screws isn't screwed on tight enough , that thing could fall and kill us instantaneously , just chop us to bits like a cuisinart .
not_available Yeah , an assassin with a semi automatic could walk through the door and spray our brains all over the place .
not_available The sun could become a supernova and engulf the entire planet in flames .
not_available David Fisher .
not_available Yeah , we just got a call from Claire's school .
not_available She's in trouble .
not_available Can't Mom handle this ?
not_available Nuh uh .
not_available She's MIA .
not_available And besides , I think you might be interested in what they told me .
not_available What?! ?
not_available Start from the beginning .
not_available Jesus !
not_available OK , I'll be right there .
not_available Until then , tell Nate
not_available Oh , great , he's MIA , too ?
not_available Alright , bye .
not_available There's a rumor going around school that my sister put a dismembered foot into some boy's locker .
not_available Shut the fuck up .
not_available She did it .
not_available I know she did .
not_available Where's the foot now ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available The student who supposedly found it now denies that it ever happened .
not_available OK , where's your sister ?
not_available No one knows .
not_available A police report has been filed , and now Mom is supposed to meet with the principal at 9 tomorrow .
not_available I don't understand kids .
not_available When I was her age , I never would have taken a foot .
not_available David , I can help .
not_available I'm a cop .
not_available That's what I do for a living .
not_available You find feet?! ?
not_available What the fuck am I gonna do ?
not_available Tell me who lived here again .

not_available You used to hang out over here ?
not_available Jeannie Fritzen and I used to play here after school .
not_available Both her parents worked .
not_available Brenda , this is serious .
not_available My entire family could go bankrupt .
not_available So , swallow your pride , go back to the corporation , and sell .
not_available They cut their offer in half now that they know we're so quick to buckle under .
not_available Plus , I really don't wanna let that greedy little Nazi win .
not_available Oh , so this is a pissing contest .
not_available Nate , I'm gonna get you !
not_available I lost someone's foot today .
not_available Sorry .
not_available I really thought I had like this profound revelation .
not_available Fuck , if this isn't what I'm supposed to be doing with my life , then what is ?
not_available Living it .
not_available And you're doing that so relaxed .
not_available You really don't give a fuck what I'm going through , do you ?
not_available Sure .
not_available As much as I can , given we've known each other less than a month .
not_available There's no big investment .
not_available I mean that's part of the appeal for both of us .
not_available Right ?
not_available Right ?
not_available Jeannie Fritzen tried to kiss me in this room .
not_available I wouldn't let her .
not_available You can't control things .
not_available Nobody can . / Shut up .
not_available There's only one thing that's
certain Everything changes .
not_available / Shut up .
not_available I already talked to the other cops .
not_available I mean , I don't understand why I have to go through this again .
not_available Because this time , I want the truth .
not_available Man /
not_available Now , a witness already said she saw you running down the hall screaming the crazy funeral home girl put a foot in your locker .
not_available It was a joke .
not_available OK ?
not_available It was just a joke .
not_available She's just this girl who's kind of a loser , and we all pick on her , you know ?
not_available She totally asked for it .
not_available You know , modern technology's really something .
not_available I don't care , man .
not_available You should .
not_available We now have chemicals we can put on our hands to tell if you've touched human remains .
not_available No way .
not_available You wanna tell me what really happened today ?
not_available Who's that ?
not_available That's my partner .
not_available You'd better be glad you don't have to mess with him .
not_available That guy's into some crazy ass shit .
not_available Now , either you can tell me where you put the foot , or you're gonna be dealing with that crazy ass motherfucker .
not_available We won !
not_available Oh God , I just can't believe it !
not_available I won $6 !
not_available I told you this would be fun .
not_available How much did you win ?

not_available He threw it out of his car?! ?
not_available He was taking it to show some friends .
not_available And it hit him .
not_available Might get it trouble , what with people not really supposed to be in possession of other peoples' feet .
not_available He tossed it out .
not_available I've gotta get home .
not_available Just drop me off , and I'll pick up my car later .
not_available Alright , I'll take a look where he said he tossed it .
not_available You don't have to do that .
not_available Hey , how can I sleep , huh ?
not_available Knowing that there's a foot on the loose ?
not_available You lost $25,000 that's just gone?! ?
not_available I suppose it still exists .
not_available It's just not mine anymore .
not_available I'm waiting for an explanation .
not_available Don't talk to me like a child .
not_available I was on awhat
not_available do you call it ?
not_available a roll , so I kept betting more and more , and I just felt so good , like I was living someone else's life .
not_available I was up $9000 , and then I started to lose ,
not_available and then I started to feel like me again , and so I kept betting more and more and more and losing more and more .
not_available You should have been more careful .
not_available I don't wanna be careful .
not_available I wanna feel alive .
not_available There should be a way to do that that's a little less expensive .
not_available I have a right to make mistakes , Nate .
not_available You , of all people , shouldn't begrudge me that .

not_available and I can't find it .
not_available Describe it to me again .
not_available It's a foot .
not_available Why did you take it in the first place ?
not_available Well , at the time , it seemed like a good way to pay him back for something .
not_available I just wanted to shake him up .
not_available I don't understand how guys can be so unshakable .
not_available I know what you mean .

not_available Casket climber .
not_available Her ?

not_available I know he can be a little uptight , but underneath that , he's such a little boy .
not_available Innocent .
not_available And I like that .
not_available Most of the men I meet , well they kind of just want me to be one thing .
not_available Like what ?
not_available Big black sex cop ?
not_available Sorry , I was speeding , officer .
not_available Guess you have to punish me now .
not_available Yeah .
not_available And I don't wanna be that .

not_available He's under a lot of stress with that cremation place opening across the street .
not_available What cremation place ?
not_available She stole a foot ?
not_available From a person ?

not_available The cop .
not_available I asked him to help out .
not_available He says he's gonna see what he can do about there not being an official report .
not_available Why does this person have to be so involved in our life ?
not_available Claire , we should probably talk about getting you some help .
not_available You're not my father .
not_available If you need a project , get a dog .
not_available Keith says the school's probably gonna make me see a shrink , anyway .

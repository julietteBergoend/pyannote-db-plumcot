not_available You can have anything you want .
not_available It's yours for the taking .
not_available Now , we've been conditioned to think that this isn't fair somehow , that that's taking away something from someone else , right ?
not_available Right , right .
not_available Wrong .
not_available The bounty of the universe is without limits .
not_available What exactly is Beauty Vision , anyway ?
not_available Oh , it's a personalized life management system .
not_available Sounds kinda culty .
not_available Everybody wants a better life .
not_available Shit , two years ago , I was living out of my fuckin' car .
not_available He told me the first time we went out , he was going to marry me .
not_available It was unbelievably romantic , and now I have this beautiful baby .

not_available I'm kind of curious as to how this works .
not_available No breakfast ?
not_available Why'd you let me sleep so late ?
not_available I didn't have the heart to wake you up .
not_available You looked so relaxed , which I don't see that often .
not_available Today's the reading of Dad's will .
not_available You know about that .
not_available It'll all be over real soon .
not_available Thank you for sleeping over .
not_available You snore .
not_available Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow night .

not_available I never know when I'm gonna have to work , Keith .
not_available And this is a busy time for us .
not_available A lot of people hold on for one last Christmas and then buh bye .
not_available I always thought shiatsu was more intense than this .
not_available Oh , we'll get there .
not_available I'm just trying to find out where you're wounded .
not_available Wounded ?
not_available I got stabbed in the thigh with a Bic pen once .
not_available I wasn't speaking literally .
not_available Aah ! /
not_available Oh , here's a good one .
not_available Old but recently reopened .
not_available /
not_available You're so full of shit .
not_available We're all wounded .
not_available We carry our wounds around with us throughout life and eventually they kill us .
not_available Things happen that leave a mark in space , in time , in us .
not_available Alright .
not_available /
not_available No .
not_available I'm sure this is all very deep and profound , but I get enough death at home .
not_available You're supposed to be my haven away from all that .
not_available I'm not supposed to be anything .
not_available Morning , Dave .
not_available Aren't those the same clothes you had on yesterday ?
not_available Everything I own looks alike .
not_available I sense you're not being completely honest with me , Dave .
not_available Have you changed any since you were 14 ?
not_available Hey .
not_available I'm all for you getting laid , believe me .
not_available Morning .
not_available You gotta try these .
not_available They're hydroponic .
not_available Put them in water .
not_available I know the guy who grows them .
not_available He's a big supplier to the co op .
not_available So my peaches are no good ?
not_available What ?
not_available No , they're fine .
not_available Mr .
not_available Hickey wants us there on time for the reading of the will .
not_available We should all go in the same car .
not_available Great , I have to miss another day of school ?
not_available What am I , like some poor knocked up Victorian waif who has to stay hidden from view ?
not_available Fine .
not_available Go to school .
not_available Stay out all night .
not_available Live in the streets .
not_available See if I care .
not_available Was she like this when you were growing up ?
not_available No , not really ,
not_available but she was well on her way .
not_available Morning .
not_available We are looking quite spiffy in that suit , Dave .
not_available That's so clever .
not_available You're talking like the computer in the movie .
not_available Wow , you're funny .
not_available Hey , have a hydroponic raspberry , grown by a guy named Gunther , once slept with Stevie Nicks .
not_available Eew !
not_available So , Dave , you gonna tell us about her ?
not_available Who ?
not_available /
not_available Well , he's got a friend .
not_available Hey , are you and Jennifer back together ?
not_available No .
not_available Have you met someone else , Dave ?
not_available Leave him alone .
not_available Someone from outside your pod ?
not_available Shut up , asshole .
not_available Thank you , Claire .
not_available Why are you still here , anyway ?
not_available Why don't you go back to Seattle ?
not_available Because I would miss the joyful sense of belonging I get here .
not_available I have no idea what kind of service he'd want .
not_available Well , the scale depends on who he was and how he saw himself , the statement that he made with his life .
not_available He was
not_available He was like , so dynamic .
not_available He had his own business Beauty Vision .
not_available The infomercial ?
not_available Chandler invented it .
not_available Large scale .
not_available I'll arrange viewings for tomorrow and the next day at Cedar Hill .
not_available Service 4,200 .
not_available Now , we should choose on an appropriate resting vessel , one that befits a man of his stature .
not_available May I ask what kind of car your husband preferred ?
not_available He drives a BMW .
not_available Do you know which model ?
not_available The biggest , fastest one .
not_available I recommend the Titan Series .
not_available Solid mahogany , pan finished with burwood accents , the same wood used in luxury automobile interiors .
not_available Looks expensive .
not_available It's more than just a casket .
not_available It's a tribute , really .
not_available OK .
not_available Are we finished ?
not_available Major credit card to get us started .
not_available Hi !
not_available I ,
not_available Nathaniel Samuel Fisher , a resident of Los Angeles County , California , declare this to be my last will , and revoke all former wills and codicils .
not_available First , to my wife , Ruth , I leave all cash , bank accounts , stocks , and bonds that are in my name .
not_available That's in addition to the life insurance .
not_available Second , I bequeath the company , Fisher &amp ; Sons Funeral Home , and all real property in business interest , attached as
follows and 50% to my son , Nathaniel Samuel Fisher , Jr .
not_available What?! ?
not_available Was he high ?
not_available Why would he do that ?
not_available David !
not_available Wow , I guess I don't even rate .
not_available No , he set up a trust for you . /
not_available David , hey wait .
not_available David , David , David , David .
not_available I don't want it .
not_available Well , excuse me while I go contemplate the irony of that .
not_available What's my recourse here ?
not_available Recourse ?
not_available Your entire college education is provided for .
not_available So I don't get anything ?
not_available You get education , Claire .
not_available A privilege that not everyone gets .
not_available Well , what if I don't wanna go to college ?
not_available Well , you need it these days , not just to succeed but to survive .
not_available OK .
not_available Spare me the tough love rationalization .
not_available Just bottom line it , please .
not_available Should you decide not to go to college , the money will become available to you when you're 25 .
not_available So this is like blackmail from beyond the grave !
not_available What in the hell was Dad thinking ?
not_available Is this some kind of sick joke ?
not_available It's Fisher and Sons .
not_available You're the sons .
not_available Mom gets half a million in life insurance , which is completely fair , but I have these huge strings attached ?
not_available Let's not talk about what's fair .
not_available Mom , you can have my half .
not_available /
not_available No , your father knew exactly what he was doing .
not_available He wanted everybody happy , and we will be happy !
not_available I guess what I want is totally irrelevant !
not_available Dave , listen .
not_available I think this is all wrong .
not_available It should be yours .
not_available Or yours and Mom's .
not_available I really don't wanna discuss it now .
not_available Maybe I'll move to Florida .
not_available That's ridiculous , Mom , and it's not helping .
not_available You're all adults , and Claire will be leaving next year .
not_available Yeah , to join the Marines !
not_available I wanna learn to kill , kill , kill !
not_available Is that Mr .
not_available Swanson ?
not_available How does he look ?
not_available Easy .
not_available Head split open .
not_available Some scalp work , hair extensions to cover the stitches .
not_available Maybe .
not_available You guys are in my way .
not_available Mrs .
not_available F. Vanessa just called .
not_available We've got a fresh one at Baybury's .
not_available You pick it up .
not_available I'll get Swanson started .
not_available No can do .
not_available I've still got to finish Mrs . Huffington .
not_available Federico , her viewing is at 3 o'clock .
not_available Yeah , well , she's majorly jaundiced .
not_available Well , just crank up the pink pen spots over her casket .
not_available David , the woman looks like a banana .
not_available I don't dare brush her , the family's gonna freak !
not_available You wanna put her out like that ?
not_available Then take my name off the certificate !
not_available Nate , I need you to pick up at Baybury's Nursing Home .
not_available Uh I don't really know how .
not_available You put him on a gurney , put the gurney in the car , bring it home , take the elevator to the basement , put him in the freezer .
not_available You think you can handle that ?
not_available You own half the business now .
not_available Start pulling your weight .
not_available Newsflash !
not_available Other people exist !
not_available Hey , uh .
not_available Give me 20 minutes .
not_available I'll go with you .
not_available Thanks .
not_available So did Dad ever say anything that might explain why he'd do this ?
not_available Like , " Hey , Federico , I've lost my fucking mind!
not_available " It's a good business .
not_available Steady .
not_available I guess he was still pissed at me for not going into it , but what does he think ?
not_available He can force me ?
not_available Maybe he was pissed at Dave .
not_available Hey Do you wanna go to a thing tonight ?
not_available I'm really not in the mood for a thing tonight , Gabriel .
not_available Come on , don't go through this alone .
not_available Fat chance .
not_available It's like I've got a big sign on my head that says , " Freak with the dead dad . "
not_available And like all these people who are so tragic even knew him .
not_available I met your dad once .
not_available Remember ?
not_available He buried my grandmother , Alice .
not_available Why are you talking to me ?
not_available You think I'm a jerk ? /
not_available Yes .
not_available You know , you're different now .
not_available You can see through walls .
not_available Uh huh .
not_available Don't your skanks need to be walked ?
not_available I wanna see you .
not_available Mrs .
not_available Fisher ?
not_available I'm Matthew Gilardi .
not_available Do you have a moment ?
not_available Did David mention me , by any chance ?
not_available I don't think he did .
not_available Well , I thought I'd drop off the details of our buy out offer so you can look it over .
not_available The terms are quite generous , especially the stock options .
not_available Who are you to buy us out ?
not_available I never saw you before in my life .
not_available I represent Kroehner Services , International .
not_available A chain ?
not_available Kroehner is a family of quality death care facilities , Mrs . Fisher .
not_available We have 157 units in Southern California , and we're inviting you to be 158 .
not_available You really should discuss this situation with your son , David .
not_available I have two sons .
not_available Really ?
not_available I was only aware of one .
not_available I know how many sons I have , Mr . Gilardi .
not_available Yes , ma'am .
not_available Just look at the numbers .
not_available I'll let myself out .
not_available Good morning .
not_available How are you folks today ?
not_available Don't expect to be popular .
not_available Hey , baby !
not_available Nate , look at you .
not_available Look at you !
not_available Four and a half months , and this one wants out already .
not_available Mr .
not_available Suarez ready to go ?
not_available Yeah , honey .
not_available We got a little problem .
not_available My sister can't pick up Julio from pre school .
not_available She got another callback from that cat food commercial . /
not_available Your sister .
not_available Well , what about my career , huh ?
not_available I can't do it .
not_available Not today .
not_available David's head would explode .
not_available Nate , you oughtta remind your brother how many clients I have referred to you guys from here , and tell him to cut Rico some slack .
not_available Rico , go .
not_available I'm the new boss , right ?
not_available OK .
not_available I'm telling Dave
not_available you said I could .
not_available Yeah .
not_available /
not_available Yeah .
not_available I can do this .
not_available I just need some help getting him onto the gurney .
not_available You can touch him if you wear one of these .
not_available Believe me , he won't mind .
not_available Alright .
not_available Pull the bed back .
not_available Line it up with the gurney .
not_available Alright .
not_available Like this ?
not_available /
not_available Yeah .
not_available Let me take this off for a second .
not_available Alrighty .
not_available You grab his shoulders .
not_available On 3 .
not_available Ready ?
not_available Whoa !
not_available Angel lust .
not_available Does that happen a lot ?
not_available A fair amount .
not_available You can be dead , but you're never really dead .
not_available Hello ? /
not_available So I've been thinking .
not_available We skipped way too many steps .
not_available We need to have a first date .
not_available OK .
not_available I'm at Pino , Hollywood .
not_available Know where that is ?
not_available You mean right now ?
not_available /
not_available Yeah .
not_available Uh , I'd love to , but I've got a dead body in the car with me .
not_available Wow , I can certainly understand why you wouldn't want to get away from that .
not_available Come on .
not_available Just a glass of wine .
not_available 15 minutes .
not_available The dead guy won't mind .
not_available Do me a favor .
not_available Keep out of the sun .
not_available Yeah , sure .
not_available I'd forgotten .
not_available They make these noises , and air comes out .
not_available It's like Dad knew that I hated this whole fucked up business .
not_available He should respect that .
not_available And poor Dave , I'd be pissed , too , although he does seem to take to this extra Old Testament level .
not_available So does that mean you're not going back to Seattle on Sunday ?
not_available Fuck !
not_available OK .
not_available Don't think about it .
not_available Tell me about yourself .
not_available Like this is our first date and we never had sex before you knew my name .
not_available You mean the recap of major life events told in a humorous and self deprecating manner , which almost always gets me laid ?
not_available No .
not_available /
not_available Why not ?
not_available I'm not that guy with you .
not_available Who are you ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available Somebody new .
not_available It's because of your father .
not_available You were with me at your most vulnerable .
not_available You felt comfortable .
not_available You felt really accepted .
not_available You always analyze guys on the first date ?
not_available Only if they're interesting .
not_available Oh , so you think I'm interesting ?
not_available Oh ,
not_available yeah .
not_available I don't meet that many men with dead guys with hard ons in their car .
not_available So when Mrs . Swanson's credit card didn't go through , I ran a credit check , and they were in debt up to their ears .
not_available We have a $3,200 Titan Casket being delivered tomorrow .
not_available Why didn't you tell me there's an offer to buy us out ?
not_available I know what you and Dad thought of Kroehner Service , International .
not_available You don't know what I think .
not_available Not that it matters to you .
not_available And Nate is not your enemy .
not_available He'll do whatever you want .
not_available Why do you say that ?
not_available He spent his entire life doing what he wants .
not_available Dad must've really hated me .
not_available Hush !
not_available It's Fisher &amp ; Sons , and that's gotta continue .
not_available And you're never gonna have any kids .
not_available Well , it's about time .
not_available What took you so long ?
not_available I stopped to eat .
not_available I wish you'd called .
not_available I think Mr .
not_available Suarez kinda shit himself .
not_available Is that normal ? /
not_available You stopped to eat ?
not_available Do you have any respect for human life at all ?
not_available I have a huge respect for human life .
not_available I just didn't know they can take a dump when they're dead .
not_available Well , they can .
not_available Make a note .
not_available Boys , I don't like this bickering .
not_available Yeah ?
not_available Well , I don't like you sleeping with hairdressers .
not_available Look , don't take this out on Mom .
not_available What is it
not_available you wanna say to me ?
not_available Well , there's a body that spent over two hours in a van , unrefrigerated , decomposing at a rate much faster than you could ever imagine .
not_available Thanks for making my life just that much more difficult .
not_available Thanks for undermining my authority with our employees .
not_available And thanks for making it so clear to me that my choice to dedicate myself to this business and to this family was really stupid , because , apparently , I would've been rewarded just the same for wasting my life .
not_available Oh , my life is a waste ?
not_available Fuck you !
not_available At least I enjoy it .
not_available Well , lucky you .
not_available Dave , at least let me help .
not_available You've helped enough .
not_available It's just not fair that my whole life is being decided by other people .
not_available Hey , college is paid for , they have great parties , no student loans to pay off .
not_available I'm not exactly a party person .
not_available By the way , that shit you gave me the night my dad died , it really fucked me up .
not_available I'm sorry about that .
not_available You should be .
not_available Why is college like the only option ?
not_available I don't even know what I wanna do .
not_available I just feel like there's something inside me .
not_available I'd just like to figure out what it is before I get like completely reprogrammed .
not_available Hey , nobody could reprogram you .
not_available You're the most original girl in the school .
not_available Come on .
not_available Look at this car that you drive .
not_available This face that you drive .
not_available Thanks a lot , liar .
not_available I'm serious .
not_available You know how much guts it takes to be somebody like you ?
not_available You can touch him if you wear one of these .
not_available Believe me , he won't mind .
not_available He won't care .
not_available Well , whaddaya got there , David ?
not_available Who is that ?
not_available That's him ?
not_available That's Mr .
not_available Bloomberg ?
not_available Put him right down next to him there , and see if it is .
not_available Oh , my goodness !
not_available Yeah , you're OK , David .
not_available Mom wants to see us .
not_available I'm going on a hike with someone .
not_available OK .
not_available OK?!
not_available ?
not_available /
not_available I am not asking your permission , David .
not_available I am your mother .
not_available How dare you ?
not_available You both have private lives , and I know it .
not_available Why shouldn't I ?
not_available You should .
not_available Go .
not_available Excuse me .
not_available I need her to meet with Mrs . Swanson .
not_available It's Fisher and Sons .
not_available Well , this sucks .
not_available I have to got to fight for a hole in the ground at Rosemont Cemetary , or Mr .
not_available and Mrs . Suarez won't be buried together .
not_available They'll be on opposite sides of the goddamned freeway .
not_available Dave , listen .
not_available Can I do anything to help ?
not_available Can you tell Adele Swanson
not_available we know she's broke and can't afford the funeral she ordered ?
not_available Can you do that ?
not_available I guess .
not_available Yes .
not_available The Swansons are con artists .
not_available They run a franchise pyramid scheme .
not_available They have no money , and they're not gonna con us too .
not_available I made some notes in case you're not familiar with credit reports .
not_available You know , I work with vendors .
not_available Big ones .
not_available National ones .
not_available I'm not an idiot .
not_available I can do this .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Shit .
not_available What ?
not_available Do you have to be anywhere tonight ?
not_available Not really .
not_available The other Mrs . Fisher recommended the $9000 coffin .
not_available I didn't ask for it .
not_available I think cremation is much more dignified , and it's within range , given the financial situation .
not_available Chandler created Beauty Vision .
not_available We have franchises in 13 states and the nation of Uruguay .
not_available How much did you know about your husband's business ?
not_available Because he's been running up bad debts for some time .
not_available We were always moving .
not_available I just thought it was because he was making so much money .
not_available Each place was nicer than the last .
not_available His former partners are suing him .
not_available He had several credit cards maxed out , run ins with the IRS dating to 1996 , and Yale University would like him to stop telling people he went there .
not_available This can't be happening .
not_available I have a baby .
not_available I can't go back to waitressing , and now you're telling me we can't even afford a coffin ?
not_available What will people think ?
not_available Mrs .
not_available Swanson , I'm sitting here thinking why don't you rent it ?
not_available How much would that be ?
not_available How much do you have ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available My ATM card's not working .
not_available We'll work something out .
not_available And afterwards , we'll give you his ashes in an urn .
not_available You really loved him , didn't you ?
not_available OK .
not_available ItAs
not_available OK .
not_available ItAs alright , let it out .
not_available I think it's good you told your boys about me .
not_available Are you kidding ?
not_available It was insane .
not_available I certainly didn't choose to do it .
not_available It just happened .
not_available /
not_available It was brave .
not_available It was guilt .
not_available I loved my husband .
not_available I know you did .
not_available Hiram , when I think of us now , I feel like I'm watching the whole thing on some sex channel on cable TV .
not_available Is that right ?
not_available Yes , and that my husband might be watching us , too .
not_available I want some changes made , I " ll tell you that .
not_available I'm not answering dead calls all night long anymore .
not_available Let them hire somebody , or sell the business , or whatever .
not_available I want to take you somewhere away from all of this .
not_available No .
not_available /
not_available They're adults .
not_available They can take care of themselves .
not_available I have 2 plane tickets to Costa Rica a week from Monday .
not_available Separate rooms .

not_available Who the fuck are you ?

not_available Now get the hell out before I call the cops .
not_available You people suck !

not_available Swanson is in the Titan Casket .
not_available Yeah ,
not_available yeah ,
not_available yeah ,

not_available We've had sex twice .
not_available Once with our clothes on , and once in the dark after three martinis a piece .

not_available Would you be willing to stipulate that you understand the condition of the coffin ?
not_available Sure , whatever .

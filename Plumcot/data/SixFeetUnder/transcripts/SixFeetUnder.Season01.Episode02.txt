david_fisher Hi !
attorney I ,
attorney Nathaniel Samuel Fisher , a resident of Los Angeles County , California , declare this to be my last will , and revoke all former wills and codicils .
attorney First , to my wife , Ruth , I leave all cash , bank accounts , stocks , and bonds that are in my name .

attorney Should you decide not to go to college , the money will become available to you when you're 25 .
claire_fisher So this is like blackmail from beyond the grave !
nate_fisher What in the hell was Dad thinking ?
nate_fisher Is this some kind of sick joke ?
ruth_fisher It's Fisher and Sons .
ruth_fisher You're the sons .
claire_fisher Mom gets half a million in life insurance , which is completely fair , but I have these huge strings attached ?
ruth_fisher Let's not talk about what's fair .
nate_fisher Mom , you can have my half .
not_available /
ruth_fisher No , your father knew exactly what he was doing .
ruth_fisher He wanted everybody happy , and we will be happy !
claire_fisher I guess what I want is totally irrelevant !
nate_fisher Dave , listen .
nate_fisher I think this is all wrong .
nate_fisher It should be yours .
nate_fisher Or yours and Mom's .
david_fisher I really don't wanna discuss it now .
ruth_fisher Maybe I'll move to Florida .
david_fisher That's ridiculous , Mom , and it's not helping .
ruth_fisher You're all adults , and Claire will be leaving next year .
claire_fisher Yeah , to join the Marines !
claire_fisher I wanna learn to kill , kill , kill !

federico_diaz I don't dare brush her , the family's gonna freak !
federico_diaz You wanna put her out like that ?
federico_diaz Then take my name off the certificate !
david_fisher Nate , I need you to pick up at Baybury's Nursing Home .

nate_fisher So did Dad ever say anything that might explain why he'd do this ?
nate_fisher Like , " Hey , Federico , I've lost my fucking mind !
federico_diaz " It's a good business .
federico_diaz Steady .
nate_fisher I guess he was still pissed at me for not going into it , but what does he think ?
nate_fisher He can force me ?
federico_diaz Maybe he was pissed at Dave .
gabe_dimas Hey Do you wanna go to a thing tonight ?
claire_fisher I'm really not in the mood for a thing tonight , Gabriel .
gabe_dimas Come on , don't go through this alone .
claire_fisher Fat chance .

matthew_gilardi Did David mention me , by any chance ?
ruth_fisher I don't think he did .
matthew_gilardi Well , I thought I'd drop off the details of our buy out offer so you can look it over .
matthew_gilardi The terms are quite generous , especially the stock options .
ruth_fisher Who are you to buy us out ?
ruth_fisher I never saw you before in my life .
matthew_gilardi I represent Kroehner Services , International .
ruth_fisher A chain ?

not_available /
brenda_chenowith Yeah .
nate_fisher Uh , I'd love to , but I've got a dead body in the car with me .
brenda_chenowith Wow , I can certainly understand why you wouldn't want to get away from that .
brenda_chenowith Come on .
brenda_chenowith Just a glass of wine .
brenda_chenowith 15 minutes .
brenda_chenowith The dead guy won't mind .
nate_fisher Do me a favor .
nate_fisher Keep out of the sun .
#unknown#SixFeetUnder.Season01.Episode02 Yeah , sure .
nate_fisher I'd forgotten .
nate_fisher They make these noises , and air comes out .
nate_fisher It's like Dad knew that I hated this whole fucked up business .
nate_fisher He should respect that .
nate_fisher And poor Dave , I'd be pissed , too , although he does seem to take to this extra Old Testament level .
brenda_chenowith So does that mean you're not going back to Seattle on Sunday ?
nate_fisher Fuck !
not_available OK .
brenda_chenowith Don't think about it .
brenda_chenowith Tell me about yourself .
brenda_chenowith Like this is our first date and we never had sex before you knew my name .
nate_fisher You mean the recap of major life events told in a humorous and self deprecating manner , which almost always gets me laid ?
nate_fisher No .
not_available /
brenda_chenowith Why not ?
nate_fisher I'm not that guy with you .
brenda_chenowith Who are you ?
nate_fisher I don't know .
nate_fisher Somebody new .
brenda_chenowith It's because of your father .
brenda_chenowith You were with me at your most vulnerable .
brenda_chenowith You felt comfortable .
brenda_chenowith You felt really accepted .
nate_fisher You always analyze guys on the first date ?
brenda_chenowith Only if they're interesting .
nate_fisher Oh , so you think I'm interesting ?
brenda_chenowith Oh ,
brenda_chenowith yeah .
not_available I don't meet that many men with dead guys with hard ons in their car .
not_available So when Mrs . Swanson's credit card didn't go through , I ran a credit check , and they were in debt up to their ears .
not_available We have a $3,200 Titan Casket being delivered tomorrow .
not_available Why didn't you tell me there's an offer to buy us out ?
not_available I know what you and Dad thought of Kroehner Service , International .
not_available You don't know what I think .
not_available Not that it matters to you .
not_available And Nate is not your enemy .
not_available He'll do whatever you want .
not_available Why do you say that ?

nathaniel_fisher And you're never gonna have any kids .
david_fisher Well , it's about time .
david_fisher What took you so long ?
nate_fisher I stopped to eat .

david_fisher You stopped to eat ?
david_fisher Do you have any respect for human life at all ?

david_fisher Thanks for making my life just that much more difficult .
david_fisher Thanks for undermining my authority with our employees .
david_fisher And thanks for making it so clear to me that my choice to dedicate myself to this business and to this family was really stupid , because , apparently , I would've been rewarded just the same for wasting my life .
nate_fisher Oh , my life is a waste ?
nate_fisher Fuck you !
nate_fisher At least I enjoy it .
david_fisher Well , lucky you .
nate_fisher Dave , at least let me help .
david_fisher You've helped enough .

gabe_dimas Hey , college is paid for , they have great parties , no student loans to pay off .
claire_fisher I'm not exactly a party person .
claire_fisher By the way , that shit you gave me the night my dad died , it really fucked me up .
gabe_dimas I'm sorry about that .
claire_fisher You should be .
claire_fisher Why is college like the only option ?
claire_fisher I don't even know what I wanna do .
claire_fisher I just feel like there's something inside me .
claire_fisher I'd just like to figure out what it is before I get like completely reprogrammed .
gabe_dimas Hey , nobody could reprogram you .
gabe_dimas You're the most original girl in the school .
not_available Come on .
gabe_dimas Look at this car that you drive .

not_available Dave , listen .
nate_fisher Can I do anything to help ?
david_fisher Can you tell Adele Swanson
david_fisher we know she's broke and can't afford the funeral she ordered ?
david_fisher Can you do that ?
nate_fisher I guess .
not_available Yes .
david_fisher The Swansons are con artists .
david_fisher They run a franchise pyramid scheme .
david_fisher They have no money , and they're not gonna con us too .

nate_fisher I'm not an idiot .
not_available I can do this .

gabe_dimas Do you have to be anywhere tonight ?
claire_fisher Not really .
adele_swanson The other Mrs . Fisher recommended the $9000 coffin .
adele_swanson I didn't ask for it .
nate_fisher I think cremation is much more dignified , and it's within range , given the financial situation .
adele_swanson Chandler created Beauty Vision .
adele_swanson We have franchises in 13 states and the nation of Uruguay .
nate_fisher How much did you know about your husband's business ?
nate_fisher Because he's been running up bad debts for some time .
adele_swanson We were always moving .
adele_swanson I just thought it was because he was making so much money .
adele_swanson Each place was nicer than the last .
nate_fisher His former partners are suing him .
nate_fisher He had several credit cards maxed out , run ins with the IRS dating to 1996 , and Yale University would like him to stop telling people he went there .
adele_swanson This can't be happening .
adele_swanson I have a baby .
adele_swanson I can't go back to waitressing , and now you're telling me we can't even afford a coffin ?
adele_swanson What will people think ?
not_available Mrs .

not_available Can't .
not_available I gotta get ready for my trip .
not_available What trip ?
not_available Vegas , baby .
not_available Vegas .
not_available The annual Western States Funeral Directors Conference .
not_available Was that today ?
not_available I thought that was months away .
not_available No , just me and David and 300 funeral directors cutting loose in the city of sin .
nate_fisher Why would you do that to yourself ?
nate_fisher We get to attend helpful seminars where we learn new tricks of the trade .
nate_fisher We get to commiserate with all the other sad fucks who are being edged out by Kroehner .
not_available We have the perfect opportunity to get in Matt Gilardi's face , tell him we know Kroehner burned down the house across the street .
not_available The ongoing pissing contest .
not_available That'll be good for you and David .
not_available You'll have fun .
nate_fisher I don't know how much fun he's gonna have .
not_available He's giving this big speech about the future of the independent funeral home .
not_available David doesn't strike me as the type of guy who gives speeches .
nate_fisher My dad was scheduled to do it .
nate_fisher Dave volunteered to fill in .
not_available It's kind of a big deal for him .
brenda_chenowith He's pretty nervous about it .
not_available Call me from Vegas .
not_available I will .
not_available Unless I'm flailing about in a pool having sex with some showgirl .
not_available I'll miss you .
not_available Oh , fuck you !
not_available I know this is an exceptionally difficult time for you
not_available but can you tell us what you had in mind for your son's I'm sorry .
not_available We're only here because the hospital suggested we call you guys .
not_available We're not even sure what we're doing here .
not_available He is a perfectly healthy baby .
not_available Can I ask , what was the cause of ?
david_fisher SIDS .
not_available Yes , well , if you need to take some time before we start making arrangements that's completely understandable .
not_available The arrangements ?
not_available What arrangements ?
not_available For his funeral .
mike_cooper Funeral ?
not_available He was only 3 weeks old .
not_available It might help if you think of it less as a funeral and more as a way of saying goodbye to him .
not_available I don't want to say goodbye .
not_available He just barely got here .
not_available Of course it's difficult for anyone to come to terms with something as unexpected as this , but It's not just difficult .
nate_fisher It's not even remotely possible .
not_available Some babies are just too good for this world .
not_available We'll fix things so you can spend as much time with him as you need .
not_available How old is he ?
not_available Barely 3 weeks .
not_available SIDS ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Oh , Jesus .
not_available You should've been here for the intake .
not_available The parents are practically children themselves .
not_available They didn't even know they were supposed to have a funeral .
not_available Welcome back , Rico .
not_available Thanks , Nate .
not_available You're sure you're up to this ?
not_available Yeah ,
not_available yeah ,
david_fisher it's no problem .
not_available We'll only be gone till Sunday .
not_available If you need anything , I can hop on a plane and be back in an hour and a half .
not_available I'll be fine .
not_available I have some of your T shirts here .
not_available They're still warm .
not_available Mom .
not_available Oh , don't let me stop you .
not_available You know , I probably should take a couple of those T shirts with me to Las Vegas .
not_available David , I want to ask you something .
not_available I'm really kind of in a hurry here .
not_available I just wanted to know Are you ?
not_available Mom .
not_available Can we talk about this when I get back from Las Vegas ?
ruth_fisher Yes , of course .
not_available That's a lovely idea .
not_available We'll talk about it when you get back from Las Vegas .
not_available Mrs .
not_available Dimas ?
not_available It's Claire Fisher .
not_available I'm sorry to keep calling , I was just wondering if you've heard anything from Gabe yet .
not_available What ?

not_available What hospital ?
not_available Okay , thank you , Mrs . Dimas .
not_available Thank you .

ruth_fisher 10 minutes .
not_available I know , I'm sorry .
not_available Is okay .
not_available I just want you to know that I notice these kinds of things .
not_available It won't happen again , Nikolai .
not_available We have to talk .
not_available It's about your work .
not_available I said I was sorry for being late .
not_available No , no , no , has nothing to do with being late .
not_available Is about how you arrange the flowers .
not_available What ?
not_available There have been complaints from some of the customers .
not_available There have not .
not_available Afraid so .
nikolai Ruth .
not_available You are not so good at arranging .
not_available I am too .
nikolai No , you're not .
not_available From now on , Robbie will handle arrangement and you will work the register and help with the books .
not_available I don't want to help with the books !
not_available I helped my husband with the books for 30 years .
not_available I want to do flower arrangements .
nikolai Tell me what's wrong with my arrangements .
not_available Not all arrangements are for funerals , cupcake .
not_available You think my arrangements look funereal ?
not_available It's like Robbie said .
not_available There have been a few complaints from some customers .
nikolai No .
nikolai We done talking now .
not_available Robbie will do the arrangement , you will work on the register .
not_available You gonna nail Gilardi for the arson job in your speech ?
not_available No .
not_available Why not ?
not_available Let's think .
not_available Possible libel charges , maybe .
not_available Mind if I say something to him ?
not_available Yes .
not_available Don't .
not_available Pussy .
not_available Nate , do we have any evidence against him ?
not_available No .
david_fisher Apparently the police don't either .
not_available Look , I don't want you picking a fight with Gilardi .
not_available Why not ?
not_available You basically threatened to kill him that one time .
not_available I'm coming with you .
not_available Great .
not_available It's okay ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available I need to get out of here .
not_available All right .
not_available Oh , my God , is that a penis ?
not_available Rico .
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available It is , isn't it ?
not_available Your wife doesn't want me to say .
not_available The baby's okay
not_available , right ?
not_available Baby's fine .
not_available But you have mild to moderate preeclampsia .
not_available What is preeclampsia ?
not_available A $ 10 word for prenatal hypertension .
not_available Your blood pressure is a little higher than we'd like .
obstetrician Could cause some problems if it gets out of hand
not_available but we're not gonna let that happen .
not_available What kind of problems ?
not_available Let's not even go there .
not_available This baby's fine .
not_available Worse comes to worst , we go in a little early , we do a C section .
not_available We'll take a look at your labs , check your blood pressure in a day or two and see how we're doing then .
not_available Until then , I want you on strict bed rest .
not_available I really wouldn't worry about this .
not_available The baby is fine .
not_available If you came looking to collect more money for Anthony's funeral I'm all tapped out at the moment .
not_available This one shoots up too much speed and heroin .
not_available Now I'm stuck paying for this fancy ass hotel room to the tune of 400 bucks a pop while they keep him under observation .
not_available I'm going out for coffee and smokes .
not_available Speed and heroin ?
not_available Yeah , well , I thought I'd try something different .
not_available Different like with a needle in your arm ?
not_available Hey , what is this? !
not_available Twenty fucking questions ?
not_available I've been through this already , all right ?
gabe_dimas With the doctors , with the police , with my mom .
not_available Now I gotta put your mind at ease too ?
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available I would've been fine if you had just minded your own fucking business .
not_available Well , excuse me for giving a shit !
not_available This wasn't an accident , was it ?
not_available I wish you would just fucking leave already .
not_available Fine .
not_available Here .
not_available " The emerging role of funeral directors in mass aviation disasters . " That sounds like fun .
not_available Do you realize how many of these seminars are sponsored by Kroehner ?
brenda_chenowith Who's " Jasmine Brecker " ?
brenda_chenowith She's either a federal judge or a sex surrogate .
not_available I haven't decided yet .
not_available You got any matches ?
not_available Sure .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Okay , boys .
not_available Let's mingle .

not_available I think maybe my expectations of this trip were a little high .
not_available Oh , great .
not_available Happy hour .
not_available Well , well .
not_available The Fisher brothers .
not_available You know , I wondered if you'd even bother to show .
matthew_gilardi I understand you'll be speaking tomorrow in place of your father .
not_available What was your topic again ?
not_available The future of independent funeral homes .
not_available Well , I'm certainly looking forward to that .
not_available I'd invite you boys to the Kroehner party at the Luxor , but it's only for affiliates .
not_available Damn .
not_available Because we'd really like to be there .
not_available I'm sure you corporate lackeys really know how to party .
not_available Have fun with the other dinosaurs , boys .
not_available Oh , Matt , I have something for you .
not_available This is a pack of matches .
not_available This is for a can of lighter fluid .
not_available Next time you need to unload some cumbersome real estate , you'll be all set .
not_available Nate , that was not smart .
not_available I should've set his fucking hair on fire .
brenda_chenowith Bottoms up .
not_available I love Las Vegas .
not_available It has to be the most artificial place on earth .
not_available You think so ?
not_available More than Disneyland ?
not_available Oh , come on , more than Japan .
not_available Oh , my God .
not_available What are all these little cartoon explosions all over their butts ?
not_available They look like they're farting .
not_available Yeah .
not_available Look , coupons .
not_available Hey , Dave , you wanna get some of that famous Las Vegas $4.99 prime rib ?
nate_fisher I have it on good authority
not_available it's just as good as the $6.99 prime rib over there .
not_available No , I think I'll just head up to my room order some room service , make an early night of it .
not_available You sure ?
not_available Yeah , I should work on my speech anyway .
not_available Okay .
not_available Well , we'll see you in the morning .

brenda_chenowith Yeah , who says I want a lap dance ?
not_available Who says it's for you , baby ?
not_available Kinky .
not_available I thought I told you to leave .
not_available I drove all the way out here to Barstow .
not_available If you think I'm gonna turn around and drive back , you're seriously whacked .
not_available This is like Bumfuck , Egypt out here .
not_available You spent the night ?
not_available Yeah , I slept in my car .
claire_fisher My mom still here ?

not_available No .
not_available Are you gonna ?
not_available I haven't decided .
not_available You hungry ?

not_available I can't eat this hospital shit .
not_available It all tastes the same .
not_available Here .
not_available I got you an Egg McMuffin because I know they're your favorite .
not_available How is it ?
not_available Fucking cold .
not_available But good .
floral_instructor Thanks .
not_available In this class , we're gonna be working on freeform summer arrangements .
floral_instructor And if we have any time at the end of class , I'm not promising because I want us to get to our breathing exercises
not_available but if we have time , we might try a spiky arrangement or two .
not_available But first we're gonna start by doing a little work treating our stems .
not_available And we're gonna start by working with our woody stems because they can be a little on the tricky side and require the most TLC .
not_available Tough loving care .
not_available Okay , let's start with an azalea , one of my favorites .
not_available Starting an inch or two from the bottom of the stem and if it's a thick stem , we really have to smash them
not_available we split the stem vertically .
not_available Does anyone know why we do this ?
not_available Anyone ?
ruth_fisher Yes .
not_available So it will draw more water ?
not_available Very good .
floral_instructor Did everyone hear that ?
not_available So it will draw more water .
not_available Okay .
not_available Does everyone have their hammers ?
not_available Let's begin .
not_available You're supposed to be in bed .
not_available I needed to get some turkey franks and milk for Julio .
not_available Why didn't you call me ?
not_available I could've stopped home on my way from work .
not_available He has a snack at 3:30 .
not_available Why didn't you call your sister ?
not_available She just got two days on a new Nicolas Cage movie .
not_available She plays this hooker who witnesses a murder , then gets raped and killed .
not_available She's got lines and everything !
not_available She wants me to come visit her on the set .
not_available Well , you're supposed to be in bed .
vanessa_diaz I got bored and went to the market .
vanessa_diaz What's the big deal ?
not_available What are you doing home anyway ?
not_available I came home for lunch .
not_available I was worried .
not_available Rico , please .
not_available I'm fine .
not_available I'm not just worried about you .
not_available Okay .
not_available This is about the baby at work .
vanessa_diaz I just I can't do it .
not_available Of course you can .
not_available He looks like Like he's sleeping .
federico_diaz Like a baby who's fallen asleep .
not_available He was 3 weeks old .
not_available There was nothing wrong with him .
not_available And then , just like that he dies .
not_available For no reason .
not_available How can that be ?
not_available How can the beginning and end be so damn close together ?
not_available And now I've got this real bad feeling .
federico_diaz I haven't done a baby since Julio was born .
not_available David always does them .
not_available So make David do this one .
federico_diaz David's in Vegas until tomorrow .
not_available The viewing is this afternoon .
not_available Some babies just aren't meant for this world , Rico .
not_available But this one is .
kroehner_funeral_director Turn to page seven in your notebooks
not_available we'll go step by step through the most challenging cranial facial reconstruction I ever faced .
not_available If we could go to the next slide , please .
not_available Oh , my God .
not_available Oh , Jesus .
not_available That shit is fucked up .
not_available Nate , this is Chloe Yorkin .
not_available The job Federico left us to do for Kroehner ?
not_available Oh , God .
not_available That is like fucking science fiction .
kroehner_funeral_director The first question my team
not_available and I asked ourselves was not as it might have been at a facility with less resources
david_fisher can we do this ?
not_available They don't even credit Rico by name .
not_available Oh , man , he's gonna be furious .
brenda_chenowith Oh , God .
not_available Well , that is a very generous offer , Roger but unfortunately I am in a relationship at the moment .
not_available If I was Deal me in .
not_available Jesus , Billy .
not_available Hold on .
not_available Hey !
not_available So where's your boyfriend ?
not_available What are you doing here ?
not_available I love Vegas .
billy_chenowith You know I love Vegas .
not_available And sometimes when my sister isn't there when I need her , I hop in my car start driving , wind up here .
not_available Billy , you're lying .
not_available I'm really not .
not_available I just saw you at the blackjack table .
not_available It was a total coincidence .
brenda_chenowith You're a fucking liar .
not_available You're a selfish , manipulative , narcissistic liar .
not_available What did Mom and Dad tell you ?
not_available They told me that you made a bomb .
billy_chenowith That's fucking hilarious .
not_available So now I'm like , what , a terrorist ? "
not_available Billy Mc Veigh " ?
not_available They're fucking liars , Brenda !
not_available They hate each other and they're miserable and they're jealous of us
not_available and they want us to hate each other too .
not_available So they lie to us !
not_available No , they lied to me , you lied to me .
not_available You let me believe you tried to kill yourself .
not_available Do you know how fucked that is ?
not_available You know what ?
not_available I was so fucking drugged up
not_available I don't even really remember what happened .
not_available Dad showed me what you wrote .
not_available I was kidding , okay ?
not_available It wasn't serious .
brenda_chenowith Do you have any idea what I gave up for you ?
not_available Because I thought that if you tried to kill yourself again and succeeded I could tell myself that I did everything I could to save you .
not_available And you did .
not_available You've saved me every day since then .
not_available Well , fuck you !
not_available Brenda , don't fucking walk away I'm having a life .
not_available Just back off !
not_available Hey , you heard her !
not_available Now , fuck off !
not_available Nice .
brenda_chenowith Are you okay ?
not_available He followed us here .
not_available I hate to say it , but I'm not entirely surprised .
not_available Very nice .
not_available Luscious .
not_available This is a little tight .
floral_instructor Tight ?
not_available You're not breathing right .
floral_instructor I'm not ?
not_available You're breathing from here when you should be breathing from here .
not_available But my lungs are here .
not_available Of course they are .
not_available I'm speaking metaphorically .
floral_instructor If you breathe from up here , your arrangements will come from up here .
not_available If you breathe from down here , your arrangements will come from down here .
not_available And that's good ?
not_available That's very good .
not_available Do you do yoga ?
not_available No .
not_available Okay .
not_available Would everybody grab a yoga mat in the next room ?
not_available We're gonna do some breathing exercises before we break for dinner .
not_available You're a bit of a control freak , aren't you ?
not_available No , I'm not .
not_available I don't think I am .
not_available Am I ?
not_available Yes .
not_available And control freaks do not make good arrangers .
not_available Believe me , I know .
floral_instructor I used to be a control freak too .
floral_instructor But you know what ?
not_available You can get over it .
not_available All you have to do is learn to breathe .
not_available Are you on antidepressants ?
not_available No !
not_available Well , Lord knows I'd be lost without my Saint John's Wort .
not_available There are countless challenges facing independent funeral homes
david_fisher Changing social attitudes toward death and dying economic hardship in communities both large and small
david_fisher Oh , what the hell .
not_available We all know what the real challenge is .
not_available How are you doing today , Mr .
not_available Gilardi ?
david_fisher Fine , thank you .
not_available Glad to hear it .
not_available We all know of a certain organization that controls the flow of prep room supplies caskets , cemetery property and flowers to everyone in this room .
not_available And believe me , that organization will stoop to almost any means to make sure that the independent funeral home has no future .
not_available But hear me out .
not_available My father was in this business for over 35 years .
david_fisher He
david_fisher He thought it was okay to tell people about a cheaper casket .
not_available He didn't always try to talk people out of cremation .
david_fisher There were even times where I actually heard him
david_fisher " To hell with our profit margin on this . " These words are heresy to a certain organization because profit is all it cares about no matter how many PR
not_available motivated seminars it sponsors .
not_available That organization wants us independents to believe that we cannot afford to be like my father anymore .
not_available Well , I'm sorry , but that's bullshit .
not_available Don't get me wrong , my father worried about the bottom line too but he worried more about other things .
not_available Like comforting people and helping them face profound loss .
not_available Maybe now more than ever , we should all try to be a little more like him .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Very motivational .
not_available Good job .
not_available How'd I do ?
not_available Are you kidding ?
not_available You kicked some serious ass , you big freak .
claire_fisher You didn't come home last night .
not_available Well , it's not like it was a school night .
claire_fisher Would you like me to make you something to eat ?
not_available Yeah , that'd be great .
not_available Do you think I'm a control freak ?
not_available Yeah .
ruth_fisher Where do you think David gets it from ?
not_available Your father was very controlling .
not_available Not like you .
not_available That's not nice .
not_available You asked .
not_available You're not as bad as you used to be .
not_available May I ask where you were all night ?
ruth_fisher In Barstow .
not_available What in God's name were you doing there ?
not_available I was visiting a friend of mine who's in the hospital .
not_available Who ?
not_available Gabriel Dimas .
not_available The young man whose brother
not_available Yeah .
not_available What was he doing in the hospital ?
not_available He OD'd .
not_available Good Lord .
not_available Claire
not_available he's obviously a deeply disturbed boy .
not_available You need to steer clear of him .
not_available Let his family deal with this .
claire_fisher Well , let's take stock for a second , shall we ?
not_available His little brother's dead .
not_available His father's dead .
claire_fisher His stepfather beat him up his white trash mother who smokes like a fish could give a shit .
ruth_fisher That leaves no one .
not_available Was his overdose an accident ?
not_available Of course it was an accident .
not_available Because sometimes these things aren't .
not_available And if it wasn't , it could happen again .
not_available There's an 80%/% chance that someone
not_available It wasn't a suicide attempt .
ruth_fisher I hope , for his sake , you're right .
not_available But if you're wrong , Claire I don't want you getting too close to him .
not_available Thank you .
not_available No problem .
not_available Look at him .
not_available He's a star .
not_available Hi .
david_fisher Really great .
david_fisher I just want you guys to meet someone .
not_available This is my brother and partner Nathaniel Jr .
not_available And his Jasmine .
not_available Hey , there , I'm Neil Schaeger .
not_available Schaeger and Sons , from Flagstaff .
not_available Raymond Dooley .
not_available Dooley and Moss Funeral Home , Reno , Nevada .
not_available Moss couldn't be here .
not_available Bladder cancer .
not_available That was a hell of a speech David made .
not_available Almost made me cry when those Kroehner bastards got up and left .
not_available Those fuckers have been trying to buy us out for five goddamn years .
not_available Your father was a good man .
not_available Yes , he was .
not_available Y'all don't mind if we drag your little brother out with us , do you ?
raymond_dooley I really shouldn't .
not_available Gotta let us buy you a drink at least .
david_fisher You're our hero .
not_available Well , maybe just a quick one .
not_available Quick one , my Aunt Fanny .
not_available We're gonna make a night of it .
raymond_dooley Hey , you want to go with ?

not_available I'm glad you're pleased .
not_available Mike's mom and dad drove down from Salinas .
not_available Yeah .
not_available They never got a chance to meet him .
not_available Now it's almost like they did .
not_available Do you have children ?
federico_diaz Yes .
not_available Yes , I do .
not_available I have a 4year old boy and my

not_available Thanks .
not_available Say fromage !
not_available Fromage .
not_available Hey , you were really great today , Nate .
not_available Standing up to Billy .

not_available Your brother's seriously ill , Brenda .

not_available But you know what ?
not_available We're in faux Paris , so let's party .
not_available Hi .
not_available I'm Amber .

not_available You're a lucky guy , David .
not_available I am ?
not_available Very .
not_available Your friend just bought you a lap dance with me .
not_available Excuse me ?
not_available So where you from , David ?
not_available Boston .
not_available That is the coldest place I ever lived .
not_available What part of town you live in ?
not_available Downtown .
not_available Are you even enjoying this at all ?
not_available Yeah , I'm loving it , why ?
not_available Because your dick isn't responding one bit .
not_available Look , I'm gay .
not_available It's not you .
not_available It never is me .
not_available Well , if you're gay , you won't mind if we cut this one short , will you ?
not_available What happened , buddy ?
not_available Popped your cork too soon ?
not_available He's gay ,
not_available you idiots .
not_available I wish you would've told us that .

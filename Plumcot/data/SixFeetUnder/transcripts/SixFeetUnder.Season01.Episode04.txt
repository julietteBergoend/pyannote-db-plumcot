not_available Who the fuck is it ?
not_available Hello ?
not_available Hello ?
not_available Hello ?
not_available Where are you from ?
not_available Your momma's pussy , bitch !
not_available PACO !
not_available PACO !
not_available NO !
not_available NO !
not_available Ms Chenowith gave us her account of your activities at the crime scene .
not_available Crime scene ?
not_available So you're saying it was definitely arson ?
not_available What's your story , Mr .
not_available Fisher ?
not_available Um the house is empty , I wanted to show Brenda where I used to hang out when I was a kid .
not_available I don't know why he wanted to show it to me .
not_available Can you tell us what you did while you were there ?
not_available Walked around , looked at things .
not_available Do you really expect us to believe you broke into an abandoned home just to walk around ?
not_available Oh , we fucked .
not_available You said you were there for an hour or so ?
not_available Tops .
not_available Could you walk us through what the two of you did for that hour ?
not_available Could you please be as specific as possible ?
not_available Just to establish a timeline .
not_available Well , he went down on me for a while .
not_available He's really good at it .
not_available I don't exactly remember the specifics .
not_available Oh , he was in a state .
not_available Like he had a lot of aggression to work out .
not_available She said that I was aggressive ?
not_available Oh man , she should talk !
not_available Then he fell asleep .
not_available What happened then ?
not_available We were exhausted , so we left .
not_available I left to meet somebody .
not_available He was just waking up .
not_available I don't know what he did after that .
not_available Can I go ?
not_available I think we have everything that we need .
not_available Thank you for your cooperation .
not_available Peace out , guys .
not_available Well , yeah , she left first , but I left right after that .
not_available Are you aware that the property in question was recently purchased by Kroehner Service International ?
not_available Yes , Matt Gilardi said they were planning to open a cheap cremation place and put us out of business .
not_available Was that the point where you called him a " greedy little Nazi fuck " ?
not_available Is that correct ?
not_available Yes , that is correct .
not_available You think I set the fire ?
not_available Well , you have to admit .
not_available It does seem like a beneficial turn of events for your business .
not_available So what ?
not_available Do I need a lawyer ?
not_available Not yet .
not_available You're free to go .
not_available Actually , one more thing .
not_available Do you know where your sister was the night of the fire ?
not_available No .
not_available Why ?
not_available I understand she had a run in with the law recently .
not_available A missing foot .
not_available If she's developing a pattern of acting out subsequent to her father's death Claire had nothing to do with that fire .
not_available How do you know ?
not_available I knew passing the health department inspection was too good to be true .
not_available It just meant something else would go wrong .
not_available Good , there goes a month's profit .
not_available We can live without air conditioning .
not_available Plenty of people do .
not_available Yeah , people in the third world .
not_available We can't run a business without air conditioning .
not_available If we lose any more funerals , Kroehner won't have to take us over .
not_available We'll be bankrupt .
not_available How much ?
not_available Central air ?
not_available 3 grand , easy .
not_available Guess what ?
not_available Gilardi tipped the cops off .
not_available Think I'm a suspect .
not_available That's ridiculous .
not_available Where's Claire ?
not_available School I hope .
not_available Do either one of you know where she was before the fire ?
not_available Why ?
not_available What does it ?
not_available Oh , dear God .
not_available Oh , she couldn't have Good news , bad news .
not_available The compressor's fine .
not_available Bad news is your pneumatic activator sub is shot .
not_available Normally , I could do it in a day , but with this heatwave , better give me five days .
not_available Five ?
not_available What's it gonna set us back ?
not_available Shouldn't take any more than 3700 , parts and labor .
not_available That's our 10:00 .
not_available Tell them we'll have air conditioning .
not_available Three days .
not_available He would've been 21 next week .
not_available We were gonna buy him a new bed .
not_available Now we're buying him a coffin .
not_available He shouldn't have been out with that girl in that neighborhood .
not_available It's the worst thing that could happen .
not_available To lose a child .
not_available We lost him years ago .
not_available We'll see to it that Paco. .
not_available His name is Manny .
not_available His. .
not_available His gang name was Paco .
not_available He goes by Paco .
not_available And he wasn't lost .
not_available He was assassinated .
not_available We'll see to it that he has a dignified service .
not_available We've been to three funeral homes .
not_available No one will take us .
not_available We don't turn people away here .
not_available Butsometimes when families lack the funds necessary , or insurance
not_available I've got money .
not_available We don't want your money .
not_available Mr .
not_available Bolin , if your son is willing to finance.
not_available .
not_available He's not our son .
not_available He's a gang leader .
not_available The Verato Kings .
not_available Don't you read the papers ?
not_available My name is Powerful .
not_available Paco's gonna have a fat ass funeral , whatever it costs .
not_available We've got mad cash , so long as y'all can do it up right .
not_available Now can y'all do it up right ?
not_available Or should we move on ?
not_available Uh , if you'll excuse me , Nate will show you some flower arrangements which might be to your liking .
not_available Uh , lilies are always nice Federico , I need your help .
not_available Your expertise .
not_available I've got a really tough one upstairs .
not_available Decomp ?
not_available Crispy critter ?
not_available No .
not_available Gunshots .
not_available No facial damage .
not_available It's cut and dried .
not_available The family wants a traditional Mexican funeral .
not_available Oh , what's a traditional Mexican funeral ?
not_available But there's this other guy , the deceased's gang leader
not_available What does this have to do me ?
not_available I was hoping you would talk to them for me with me .
not_available What ?
not_available Because I'm Latino
not_available I know about gangs ?
not_available Well , you probably know more than I do .
not_available And why is that ?
not_available Well , I just assumed that , maybe , somebody in your family might No .
not_available Nobody in my family .
not_available Never .
not_available I've worked here for years , and you don't know a damn about me .
not_available That's not true .
not_available You own an atlas ?
not_available An atlas ?
not_available Yeah , because , if you did , you'd know there's a 2400 mile difference between Puerto Rico and Mexico .
not_available You're Puerto Rican ?
not_available Look , Federico , I'm sorry .
not_available I just assumed We can't afford to lose this funeral , and I'm afraid if Nate and I are the point of contact , we will .
not_available This is our blue opal .
not_available Two gage aluminum and copper with a light blue sovereign velvet interior .
not_available It's nicer than our car .
not_available It's beautiful .
not_available It's not good enough .
not_available Mrs .
not_available Bolin , if this is the casket that you want for your son , then you should have it .
not_available He is your son .
not_available Hey , where are you from , dog ?
not_available One moment , please .
not_available " Where are you from? "
not_available Like where were my parents born ?
not_available San Loreso , Puerto Rico .
not_available Where are you from ?
not_available As in what gang I belong to ?
not_available Yeah , I'll tell you what gang I belong to .
not_available The gang that's gonna help you bury your friend .
not_available The gang that's gonna be there for you and your friends when every other fuckin' home doesn't wanna deal with your tired ass bullshit .
not_available Your friend is dead , man .
not_available Now , do you want me to help you or do you
not_available just wanna go
not_available heads up ?
not_available It's good .
not_available I don't like it .
not_available It's dangerous .
not_available Not if we let Rico handle everything .
not_available David , we're so white .
not_available If we step in , we will totally fuck up .
not_available Language Frankly , I'm more worried whether Claire started that fire .
not_available Why would she ?
not_available To help us out ?
not_available She hates us .
not_available Is Brenda a vegetarian ?
not_available She'll eat anything .
not_available Did you know the night that Dad died , Claire was high on crystal meth ?
not_available Oh my God !
not_available Isn't that a horse tranquilizer ?
not_available No , it's speed .
not_available Really nasty speed .
not_available It makes you crazy .
not_available If there are things you don't want me to hear , go talk about them in another room
not_available I assume she drinks ?
not_available You know , I can call and tell her to cancel .
not_available No , I've been looking forward to this .
not_available I have some errands to run .
not_available I'll pick up a nice chardonnay while I'm out .
not_available What errands ?
not_available Uh I can give you a list if you'd like .
not_available You guys , this kid at school today got busted for having a tazer , 'cause he showed it to his friends at lunch .
not_available I mean , what an idiot !
not_available There were like six cops !
not_available It was absolutely hilarious !
not_available What?! ?
not_available No , it's not really a gang funeral .
not_available Everyone wins .
not_available Yeah , right .
not_available Who are you gonna call when the bullets start flying ?
not_available Anyone but you .
not_available You're damn straight .
not_available Claire's gonna need a lawyer .
not_available A good one .
not_available Look , if she set that fire , she'll do what's right .
not_available I'll see to it .
not_available What's right is getting her some top shelf legal counsel , and having her plead the fifth .
not_available I don't care what you have to do .
not_available Just keep her out of the system .
not_available She'll be eaten alive .
not_available Is there any chance you can snoop around and find out what their game plan is ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available I already interfered once .
not_available Are you guys pulling out or what ?
not_available Yeah , in a minute .
not_available Well , let's go .
not_available Fuckin' fags , man .
not_available Keith !
not_available Keith !
not_available Say it again .
not_available What ?
not_available I said , " say it again .
not_available "
not_available Next time you call someone a fuckin' fag , you make sure that fag isn't an LAPD officer .
not_available Got that ?
not_available Understand me ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Now , you got my badge , file a complaint .
not_available How dare you ?
not_available Now get your punk ass out of here .
not_available Fuckin' bitch .
not_available Tore his ass up .
not_available I don't think he meant anything by it .
not_available Do you hate yourself that much ?
not_available This is some fucked up way to make a living , you know that ?
not_available So how was your day , man ?
not_available You don't wanna know .
not_available You ever see sunlight ?
not_available Or you gotta avoid it ?
not_available You're checkin' out my dick .
not_available I was not .
not_available I'm just fuckin' with you , man .
not_available Uh hi .
not_available It's from my parents .
not_available They'll freak when they find out .
not_available You're an hour early .
not_available Really ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Not quite as Addams Family as I expected .
not_available Dave and I used to play Addams Family when we were kids .
not_available I was usually Gomez .
not_available He was always Lurch .
not_available Kitsch factor is substantial , hence your well developed sense of irony , I suppose .
not_available It's hot in here .
not_available Do I hear voices ?
not_available Look who's early .
not_available It's a pleasure to see you again , Mrs .
not_available Fisher .
not_available I'm so glad you could make it , dear .
not_available Champagne ,
not_available how festive !
not_available Thank you .
not_available Excuse me
not_available , I'm knee deep in marinara .
not_available I'll go chill this .
not_available Nate , go get Brenda a tour .
not_available She hates me .
not_available Why do you say that ?
not_available Because it's true .
not_available What's the matter ?
not_available Afraid Mommy might see ?
not_available OK , OK , could we not turn tonight into Psych 101 , because , trust me , we would never make it through the evening .
not_available Somebody's defensive .
not_available Nate , it doesn't matter whether your mother likes me or not .
not_available I don't care .
not_available What's that shit ?
not_available Oh , hell , no !
not_available No .
not_available How come you don't call your bone daddy ?
not_available Still pissed at him , right ?
not_available Yeah , I'm feeling you , man .
not_available What gives him the right to get up in your world ?
not_available To be so fuckin'. .
not_available So fucking self righteous .
not_available That's what I'm saying .
not_available You didn't call him nothing , but he went off on you .
not_available Yeah , I think he's got a problem with that stress management shit .
not_available Hell , maybe he's one of them rageaholics .
not_available I mean , that boy went off .
not_available I know .
not_available Just because some kid calls him a fag .
not_available It's so unnecessary .
not_available But he called you a fag , too .
not_available So ?
not_available So what'd you do ?
not_available Nothing .
not_available Mm hmm .
not_available When Peter stood and warmed himself , they said therefore unto him , " Art thou one of his disciples? "
not_available He denied it and said , " I am not . "
not_available John 18:25 .
not_available No wonder he went off on you , man .
not_available You know ?
not_available Hey , bury me naked , please .
not_available It's a shame Diane Armis is dead .
not_available She could take some fucking great photographs in here .
not_available What's the matter with you today ?
not_available Nothing .
not_available I just have a lot on my mind .
not_available I don't wanna bore you with it .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Come here .
not_available Why ?
not_available Just do it .
not_available What's wrong ?
not_available Well , let's see .
not_available I'm about to become an undertaker , and I'm scared to death of it .
not_available A huge corporation wants to put us out of business , and I'm worried
not_available my sister's not only a crackhead
not_available , she's arsonist .
not_available There's a lot of sadness in this house .
not_available It's a funeral home .
not_available No wonder you ran away .
not_available You channel other people's pain , you know that
not_available , Nate ?
not_available My father called it a gift .
not_available It is a gift .
not_available Aaw !
not_available Oh God !
not_available Oh God !
not_available Guess dinner's ready .
not_available So what's it like to be interrogated ?
not_available Did you flash your crotch like Sharon Stone in that movie ?
not_available Claire
not_available They just keep asking you the same question different ways to trip you up .
not_available That's cool .
not_available Was it fun ?
not_available I bet it was kind of fun .
not_available Not really .
not_available Do you think they're gonna want to interrogate me ?
not_available No .
not_available Nate , will you say grace ?
not_available Uh , wouldn't David rather ?
not_available Please .
not_available Thank you , O Lord , for our health and bounty through Christ , our Lord , amen .
not_available What are you , on crack ?
not_available Squash ?
not_available Mom , Nate
not_available and I have been working on a business plan to figure out how we're gonna fend off Kroehner .
not_available Business plan ?
not_available Your father never had a business plan .
not_available Yeah , well that's part of the problem .
not_available We'd like to go over it with you sometime .
not_available I don't need to see it .
not_available It's your business , not mine .
not_available Is there sauce for the pasta ?
not_available I'll get it .
not_available Brenda , what do you do for a living ?
not_available She gives massages .
not_available Shiatsu .
not_available Now , what exactly is that ?
not_available It's a Japanese bodywork technique that involves pressure to points on acupuncture meridians .
not_available Well , how interesting !
not_available Accupuncture !
not_available That's the pins , right ?
not_available Yes , the pins .
not_available So you stick pins in people ?
not_available I use my thumbs , wrists , elbows , you know ?
not_available So you stick your thumbs in people .
not_available No .
not_available At least not as part of my job .
not_available I hope you stay for dessert .
not_available It's peach cobbler .
not_available Yeah .
not_available This is a nice box .
not_available That Federico's a good salesman , huh ?
not_available I'll say .
not_available You know what the markup is on one of these ?
not_available Hey , can I get a night light up in here ?
not_available I don't like the dark .
not_available Well , then , you shouldn't have gone and gotten yourself shot .
not_available Shit .
not_available That's cold , man .
not_available Mr .
not_available Powerful and his entourage are here .
not_available I'll be right there .
not_available Who are you talking to ?
not_available Myself .
not_available David , why did you stop going to church with me ?
not_available I've been going to a different church with a friend of mine .
not_available That cop ?
not_available The black man ?
not_available Don't be a pussy .
not_available Yes , Mom , that cop , the black man .
not_available I love you , Paco .
not_available Oh , God , no !
not_available You alright ?
not_available I look like a fuckin' Bible salesman .
not_available I look like you !
not_available Man , what's up with this whack ass music ?
not_available I'm not sure about the music .
not_available Yeah , it blows .
not_available What about the " Ave Maria " ?
not_available Perfect .
not_available Honey .
not_available God , no !
not_available No !
not_available No , no , no .
not_available It's like a mad scientist lab in here .
not_available How can you live here ?
not_available Better than a Turkish prison .
not_available Most days .
not_available Jesus .
not_available Toldja .
not_available Did you ever kill anybody ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available Shot at a few .
not_available Everybody thinks I burned down this house across the street .
not_available Did you ?
not_available What do you think ?
not_available What's it like , to shoot a gun ?
not_available You wanna try sometime ?
not_available Come down to my neighborhood , be down .
not_available Are you serious ?
not_available Cause I will .
not_available You're some kind of tough little bitch , huh ?
not_available You didn't hear your road dog calling for help on your machine .
not_available You ain't gonna spend the rest of your goddamned life wondering why you didn't pick up the phone the first fucking time it rang .
not_available You're hurting me .
not_available You don't know shit , little girl .
not_available Don't waste my time .
not_available This one right here is my first one .
not_available After that , man , shit , I mean I got me this one right there .
not_available When I got jumped in .
not_available Check it out .
not_available That's very intricate .
not_available Yeah ,
not_available and this one .
not_available This one took me three weeks to heal .
not_available Watch out .
not_available That's the shit , huh ?
not_available Can I help you ?
not_available Hi , it's so good to see you again .
not_available How have you been ?
not_available Fine .
not_available So sad .
not_available I read about Manuel's death in the Times , and I just had to pay my respects .
not_available Oh , it's heartbreaking .
not_available The riots .
not_available I mean , the uprising was supposed to increase the peace , and all we have is more dead children .
not_available Did you know him ?
not_available Oh , I feel I know all these innocent victims .
not_available This is not a good time .
not_available If you'd like to forward a card to the family
not_available Maybe I could just stay for a few minutes A card , I'll do that .
not_available You should have seen my baby .
not_available So happy , such a smile that could break your heart .
not_available What kind of God lets a baby like that get caught up in all that shit ?
not_available Drugs , guns , death .
not_available Mrs .
not_available Bolin , I'm not gonna tell you that it's all gonna be OK , but it just takes time .
not_available This is as bad as it gets .
not_available I have nothing to live for .
not_available You have your husband .
not_available You have you .
not_available You have the memory of that little baby .
not_available You've got to keep that alive .
not_available My father died on Christmas Eve .
not_available And there's so much I never said , never knew about him , but he's a part of me , and Manny will always be a part of you .
not_available Why didn't God take me instead of my boy ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available You gotta apologize to your boy , Keith .
not_available Otherwise you just a born bitch .
not_available You're speaking like this at your funeral ?
not_available Damn straight .
not_available I'll say whatever I goddamned please .
not_available And I've been to a ton of funerals .
not_available You see one , you see them all .
not_available Even mine .
not_available No gunfire .
not_available No fights .
not_available No .
not_available No Sharks .
not_available No Jets .
not_available Just like any other funeral .
not_available You let down , huh ?
not_available A little .
not_available A Detective McBride just called .
not_available They made a determination of the house fire .
not_available They termed it " cause unknown . "
not_available So they ruled out arson .
not_available No .
not_available They just can't tell .
not_available Either way , the case is closed .
not_available Which doesn't rule out the possibility that Claire set that fire .
not_available She didn't do that , Nate .
not_available Well , what if she did , Mom ?
not_available Pretending it didn't happen's not gonna help .
not_available I'm sorry about last night with Brenda .
not_available When you walked in on us .
not_available I know what you're talking about .
not_available Where have you been ?
not_available None of your business .
not_available When did this become a police state ?
not_available I need an altoid .
not_available The original sin wasn't eating the apple .
not_available It wasn't questioning authority .
not_available It was not giving God the chance to give his side of the argument .
not_available It was just taking the serpent's word as Gospel .
not_available It was not going back to God and saying , " Hey , what gives ?
not_available He said you're lying to us .
not_available " It was just assuming that God lies .
not_available I'm sorry about the other day .
not_available Aren't you gonna say , " Hey , man , I'm sorry , too , for revealing my dormant psycho side , and scaring the shit out of you " ?
not_available Nuh uh .
not_available Nuh uh .
not_available Do you really think I hate myself ?
not_available Good to see you , David .
not_available I know where you are .
not_available I was there , and I'll wait for you , because I love you , but I'm not moving backwards for anybody .
not_available I'm not asking you to move backwards .
not_available I'm just asking you to be patient and a little calmer .
not_available Do you have any idea what I put up with on my job everyday ?
not_available How many times the word " fag " has been written on my locker ?
not_available How many times I wonder going into a dangerous situation if I'm even going to get backup ?
not_available We were stepped on yesterday , David , and I did something about it , because I am tired of it .
not_available When you get tired of it , you let me know .
not_available Morning .
not_available Hi .
not_available You think I should make a peace offering to your mother ?
not_available No , it'll just make things worse .
not_available I brought it up yesterday , she nearly bit my head off .
not_available Oh , Jesus .
not_available No accident you guys are undertakers .
not_available You take every fucking feeling you have , put it in a box , and bury it .
not_available Better that than examine every fucking moment until all of the joy is drained out of it .
not_available Come here .
not_available No .
not_available Just do it .
not_available Sex does not solve anything , Nate .
not_available Claire , are you OK ?
not_available No .
not_available Do you wanna talk about it ?
not_available Sure .
not_available My pimp's threatening to beat me up , because I can't turn enough tricks .
not_available What's worse is , he's threatening to take away my smack .
not_available Hell .
not_available Why do you always have to be such a bitch ?
not_available Why do you always have to naturally assume I'm in trouble ?
not_available Like you guys are such shining examples ?
not_available Kroehner is going to keep strong arming our suppliers , undercutting us , stealing funerals .
not_available We're never gonna be able to compete in terms of size and market presence .
not_available Where we can compete is quality of service , integrity .
not_available We'll give them the human touch .
not_available It all sounds good .
not_available Is this over ?
not_available Well , we have to get our message out there .
not_available We're gonna have to market and promote .
not_available Replace outmoded equipment and install computers .
not_available Fine .
not_available Now , in order to make this all work , we'll need a significant financial investment .
not_available How much ?
not_available You want me to give you $93,000 from your father's life insurance ?
not_available Nobody else is going to do it .
not_available We're still paying off a bank note Dad took out years ago .
not_available We hate to ask , Mom , but we're desperate .
not_available Of course , you're not obligated .
not_available I know that .
not_available When do you need it ?
not_available Are you sure , Mom ?
not_available But it's not a loan .
not_available I'm now an investor in Fisher &amp ; Sons .
not_available We'll establish a fair percentage of equity and rate of return .
not_available I could invest in either my boys or tech stocks .

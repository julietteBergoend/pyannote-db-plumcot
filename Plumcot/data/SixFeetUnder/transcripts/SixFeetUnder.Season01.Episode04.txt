not_available Episode 4.
not_available Familia Piece of shit's whack! Try to cell..
not_available Ain't no piece of shit.
not_available The alternator's a little temperamental.
not_available Well, maybe the battery's dead.
not_available Like this phone.
not_available It ain't the battery.
not_available It's the alternator.
not_available It's like one of those "Scream" movies, huh? More like "Boyz in the Hood.
not_available " Aw
not_available ight, look, I'm gonna jet to that pay phone.
not_available One of my dogs'll hook us up.
not_available I know you ain't leavin' me in here all alone! Hey, look, you'll be safer in here.
not_available Be back in three, awight? Aw
not_available ight.
not_available Gimme some love.
not_available Ain't nobody home.
not_available Leave a message.
not_available Hey, hey, pick up the phone, dog! Hey, wake up, man! Damn! Lazy ass punk motherfucker, man.
not_available Paco! Oh my God! Who the fuck is it? Hello? Hello? Hello? Where are you from? Your momma's pussy, bitch! PACO! PACO! NO! NO! MANUEL PEDRO ANTONIO BOLIN Ms Chenowith gave us her account of your activities at the crime scene.
not_available Crime scene? So you're saying it was definitely arson? What's your story, Mr.
not_available Fisher? Um
not_available the house is empty, I wanted to show Brenda where I used to hang out when I was a kid.
not_available I don't know why he wanted to show it to me.
not_available Can you tell us what you did while you were there? Walked around, looked at things.
not_available Do you really expect us to believe you broke into an abandoned home just to walk around? Oh, we fucked.
not_available You said you were there for an hour or so? Tops.
not_available Could you walk us through what the two of you did for that hour? We
not_available uh made love.
not_available Could you please be as specific as possible? Just to establish a timeline.
not_available Well, he went down on me for a while.
not_available He's really good at it.
not_available I don't exactly remember the specifics.
not_available Oh, he was in a state.
not_available Like he had a lot of aggression to work out.
not_available She said that I was aggressive? Oh man, she should talk! Then he fell asleep.
not_available What happened then? We were exhausted, so we left.
not_available I left to meet somebody.
not_available He was just waking up.
not_available I don't know what he did after that.
not_available Can I go? I think we have everything that we need.
not_available Thank you for your cooperation.
not_available Peace out, guys.
not_available Well, yeah, she left first, but I left right after that.
not_available Are you aware that the property in question was recently purchased by Kroehner Service International? Yes, Matt Gilardi said they were planning to open a cheap cremation place and put us out of business.
not_available Was that the point where you called him a "greedy little Nazi fuck"? Is that correct? Yes, that is correct.
not_available You think I set the fire? Well, you have to admit.
not_available It does seem like a beneficial turn of events for your business.
not_available So what? Do I need a lawyer? Not yet.
not_available You're free to go.
not_available Actually, one more thing.
not_available Do you know where your sister was the night of the fire? No.
not_available Why? I understand she had a run
not_available in with the law recently.
not_available A missing foot.
not_available If she's developing a pattern of acting out subsequent to her father's death
not_available Claire had nothing to do with that fire.
not_available How do you know? I knew passing the health department inspection was too good to be true.
not_available It just meant something else would go wrong.
not_available Good, there goes a month's profit.
not_available We can live without air conditioning.
not_available Plenty of people do.
not_available Yeah, people in the third world.
not_available We can't run a business without air conditioning.
not_available If we lose any more funerals, Kroehner won't have to take us over.
not_available We'll be bankrupt.
not_available How much? Central air? 3 grand, easy.
not_available Guess what? Gilardi tipped the cops off.
not_available Think I'm a suspect.
not_available That's ridiculous.
not_available Where's Claire? 
not_available School I hope.
not_available Do either one of you know where she was before the fire? Why? What does it? Oh, dear God.
not_available They don't think Oh, she couldn't have
not_available Good news, bad news.
not_available The compressor's fine.
not_available Bad news is your pneumatic activator sub is shot.
not_available Normally, I could do it in a day, 
not_available but with this heatwave, better give me five days.
not_available Five? What's it gonna set us back? Shouldn't take any more than 3700, parts and labor.
not_available That's our 10:00.
not_available Tell them we'll have air conditioning.
not_available Three days.
not_available He would've been 21 next week.
not_available We were gonna buy him a new bed.
not_available Now we're buying him a coffin.
not_available He shouldn't have been out with that girl in that neighborhood.
not_available It's the worst thing that could happen.
not_available To lose a child.
not_available We lost him years ago.
not_available We'll see to it that Paco..
not_available His name is Manny.
not_available His..
not_available His gang name was Paco.
not_available He goes by Paco.
not_available And he wasn't lost.
not_available He was assassinated.
not_available We'll see to it that he has a dignified service.
not_available We've been to three funeral homes.
not_available No one will take us.
not_available We don't turn people away here.
not_available Butsometimes when families lack the funds necessary, or insurance 
not_available I've got money.
not_available We don't want your money.
not_available Mr.
not_available Bolin, if your son is willing to finance..
not_available He's not our son.
not_available He's a gang leader.
not_available The Verato Kings.
not_available Don't you read the papers? 
not_available My name is Powerful.
not_available Paco's gonna have a fat
not_available ass funeral, whatever it costs.
not_available We've got mad cash, so long as y'all can do it up right.
not_available Now can y'all do it up right? Or should we move on? Uh, if you'll excuse me, Nate will show you some flower arrangements which might be to your liking.
not_available Uh, lilies are always nice Federico, I need your help.
not_available Your expertise.
not_available I've got a really tough one upstairs.
not_available Decomp? Crispy critter? No.
not_available Gunshots.
not_available No facial damage.
not_available It's cut and dried.
not_available The family wants a traditional Mexican funeral.
not_available Oh, what's a traditional Mexican funeral? But there's this other guy, the deceased's gang leader
not_available What does this have to do me? I was hoping you would talk to them for me with me.
not_available What? Because I'm Latino I know about gangs? Well, you probably know more than I do.
not_available And why is that? Well, I just assumed that, maybe, somebody in your family might
not_available No.
not_available Nobody in my family.
not_available Never.
not_available I've worked here for years, and you don't know a damn about me.
not_available That's not true.
not_available You own an atlas? 
not_available An atlas? Yeah, because, if you did, you'd know there's a 2400 mile difference between Puerto Rico and Mexico.
not_available You're Puerto Rican? Look, Federico, I'm sorry.
not_available I just assumed We can't afford to lose this funeral, and I'm afraid if Nate and I are the point of contact, we will.
not_available This is our blue opal.
not_available Two gage aluminum and copper with a light
not_available blue sovereign velvet interior.
not_available It's nicer than our car.
not_available It's beautiful.
not_available It's not good enough.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Bolin, if this is the casket that you want for your son, then you should have it.
not_available He is your son.
not_available Hey, where are you from, dog? One moment, please.
not_available "Where are you from?" Like where were my parents born? San Loreso, Puerto Rico.
not_available Where are you from? As in what gang I belong to? Yeah, I'll tell you what gang I belong to.
not_available The gang that's gonna help you bury your friend.
not_available The gang that's gonna be there for you and your friends when every other fuckin' home doesn't wanna deal with your tired
not_available ass bullshit.
not_available Your friend is dead, man.
not_available Now, do you want me to help you or do you just wanna go heads up? It's good.
not_available I don't like it.
not_available It's dangerous.
not_available Not if we let Rico handle everything.
not_available David, we're so white.
not_available If we step in, we will totally fuck up.
not_available Language Frankly, I'm more worried whether Claire started that fire.
not_available Why would she? To help us out? She hates us.
not_available Is Brenda a vegetarian? She'll eat anything.
not_available Did you know the night that Dad died, Claire was high on crystal meth? Oh my God! Isn't that a horse tranquilizer? No, it's speed.
not_available Really nasty speed.
not_available It makes you crazy.
not_available If there are things you don't want me to hear, go talk about them in another room I assume she drinks? You know, I can call and tell her to cancel.
not_available No, I've been looking forward to this.
not_available I have some errands to run.
not_available I'll pick up a nice chardonnay while I'm out.
not_available What errands? Uh
not_available I can give you a list if you'd like.
not_available You guys, this kid at school today got busted for having a tazer, 'cause he showed it to his friends at lunch.
not_available I mean, what an idiot! There were like six cops! It was absolutely hilarious! What?!? No, it's not really a gang funeral.
not_available It's they needed a home, we needed a body.
not_available Everyone wins.
not_available Yeah, right.
not_available Who are you gonna call when the bullets start flying? 
not_available Anyone but you.
not_available You're damn straight.
not_available Claire's gonna need a lawyer.
not_available A good one.
not_available Look, if she set that fire, she'll do what's right.
not_available I'll see to it.
not_available What's right is getting her some top shelf legal counsel, and having her plead the fifth.
not_available I don't care what you have to do.
not_available Just keep her out of the system.
not_available She'll be eaten alive.
not_available Is there any chance you can snoop around and find out what their game plan is? I don't know.
not_available I already interfered once.
not_available Are you guys pulling out or what? Yeah, in a minute.
not_available Well, let's go.
not_available Fuckin' fags, man.
not_available Keith! Keith! 
not_available Say it again.
not_available What? I said, "say it again.
not_available " Next time you call someone a fuckin' fag, you make sure that fag isn't an LAPD officer.
not_available Got that? Understand me? Yeah.
not_available Now, you got my badge, file a complaint.
not_available How dare you? Now get your punk ass out of here.
not_available Fuckin' bitch.
not_available Tore his ass up.
not_available I don't think he meant anything by it.
not_available Do you hate yourself that much? This is some fucked up way to make a living, you know that? So how was your day, man? You don't wanna know.
not_available You ever see sunlight? Or you gotta avoid it? 
not_available You're checkin' out my dick.
not_available I was not.
not_available I'm just fuckin' with you, man.
not_available Uh
not_available hi.
not_available It's from my parents.
not_available They'll freak when they find out.
not_available You're an hour early.
not_available Really? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Not quite as Addams Family as I expected.
not_available Dave and I used to play Addams Family when we were kids.
not_available I was usually Gomez.
not_available He was always Lurch.
not_available Kitsch factor is substantial, hence your well
not_available developed sense of irony, I suppose.
not_available It's hot in here.
not_available Do I hear voices? Look who's early.
not_available It's a pleasure to see you again, Mrs.
not_available Fisher.
not_available I'm so glad you could make it, dear.
not_available Champagne, how festive! Thank you.
not_available Excuse me, I'm knee
not_available deep in marinara.
not_available I'll go chill this.
not_available Nate, go get Brenda a tour.
not_available She hates me.
not_available Why do you say that? 
not_available Because it's true.
not_available What's the matter? Afraid Mommy might see? OK, OK, could we not turn tonight into Psych 101, because, trust me, we would never make it through the evening.
not_available Somebody's defensive.
not_available Nate, it doesn't matter whether your mother likes me or not.
not_available I don't care.
not_available What's that shit? Oh, hell, no! No.
not_available How come you don't call your bone daddy? Still pissed at him, right? Yeah, I'm feeling you, man.
not_available What gives him the right to get up in your world? 
not_available To be so fuckin'..
not_available So fucking self
not_available righteous.
not_available That's what I'm saying.
not_available You didn't call him nothing, but he went off on you.
not_available Yeah, I think he's got a problem with that stress
not_available management shit.
not_available Hell, maybe he's one of them rageaholics.
not_available I mean, that boy went off.
not_available I know.
not_available Just because some kid calls him a fag.
not_available It's so unnecessary.
not_available But he called you a fag, too.
not_available So? So what'd you do? Nothing.
not_available Mm hmm.
not_available When Peter stood and warmed himself, they said therefore unto him, "Art thou one of his disciples?" He denied it and said, "I am not.
not_available " John 18:25.
not_available No wonder he went off on you, man.
not_available You know? Hey, bury me naked, please.
not_available It's a shame Diane Armis is dead.
not_available She could take some fucking great photographs in here.
not_available What's the matter with you today? Nothing.
not_available I just have a lot on my mind.
not_available I don't wanna bore you with it.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Come here.
not_available Why? Just do it.
not_available What's wrong? Well, let's see.
not_available I'm about to become an undertaker, and I'm scared to death of it.
not_available A huge corporation wants to put us out of business, and I'm worried my sister's not only a crackhead, she's arsonist.
not_available There's a lot of sadness in this house.
not_available It's a funeral home.
not_available No wonder you ran away.
not_available You channel other people's pain, you know that, Nate? My father called it a gift.
not_available It is a gift.
not_available Aaw! Oh God! Oh God! Guess dinner's ready.
not_available So what's it like to be interrogated? Did you flash your crotch like Sharon Stone in that movie? Claire
not_available They just keep asking you the same question different ways to trip you up.
not_available That's cool.
not_available Was it fun? I bet it was kind of fun.
not_available Not really.
not_available Do you think they're gonna want to interrogate me? No.
not_available Nate, will you say grace? Uh, wouldn't David rather? Please.
not_available Thank you, O Lord, for our health and bounty through Christ, our Lord, amen.
not_available What are you, on crack? Squash? Mom, Nate and I have been working on a business plan to figure out how we're gonna fend off Kroehner.
not_available Business plan? Your father never had a business plan.
not_available Yeah, well that's part of the problem.
not_available We'd like to go over it with you sometime.
not_available I don't need to see it.
not_available It's your business, not mine.
not_available Is there sauce for the pasta? 
not_available I'll get it.
not_available Brenda, what do you do for a living? 
not_available She gives massages.
not_available Shiatsu.
not_available Now, what exactly is that? It's a Japanese bodywork technique that involves pressure to points on acupuncture meridians.
not_available Well, how interesting! Accupuncture! That's the pins, right? Yes, the pins.
not_available So you stick pins in people? I use my thumbs, wrists, elbows, you know? So you stick your thumbs in people.
not_available No.
not_available At least not as part of my job.
not_available I hope you stay for dessert.
not_available It's peach cobbler.
not_available Yeah.
not_available This is a nice box.
not_available That Federico's a good salesman, huh? I'll say.
not_available You know what the markup is on one of these? Hey, can I get a night light up in here? I don't like the dark.
not_available Well, then, you shouldn't have gone and gotten yourself shot.
not_available Shit.
not_available That's cold, man.
not_available Mr.
not_available Powerful and his entourage are here.
not_available I'll be right there.
not_available Who are you talking to? Myself.
not_available David, why did you stop going to church with me? I've been going to a different church with a friend of mine.
not_available That cop? The black man? Don't be a pussy.
not_available Yes, Mom, that cop, the black man.
not_available I love you, Paco.
not_available Oh, God, no! You alright? I look like a fuckin' Bible salesman.
not_available I look like you! Man, what's up with this whack
not_available ass music? I'm not sure about the music.
not_available Yeah, it blows.
not_available What about the "Ave Maria"? Perfect.
not_available Honey.
not_available God, no! No! No, no, no.
not_available It's like a mad scientist lab in here.
not_available How can you live here? Better than a Turkish prison.
not_available Most days.
not_available Jesus.
not_available Toldja.
not_available Did you ever kill anybody? I don't know.
not_available Shot at a few.
not_available Everybody thinks I burned down this house across the street.
not_available Did you? What do you think? What's it like, to shoot a gun? You wanna try sometime? Come down to my neighborhood, be down.
not_available Are you serious? Cause I will.
not_available You're some kind of tough little bitch, huh? You didn't hear your road dog calling for help on your machine.
not_available You ain't gonna spend the rest of your goddamned life wondering why you didn't pick up the phone the first fucking time it rang.
not_available You're hurting me.
not_available You don't know shit, little girl.
not_available Don't waste my time.
not_available This one right here is my first one.
not_available After that, man, shit, I mean I got me this one right there.
not_available When I got jumped in.
not_available Check it out.
not_available That's very intricate.
not_available Yeah, and this one.
not_available This one took me three weeks to heal.
not_available Watch out.
not_available That's the shit, huh? Can I help you? Hi, it's so good to see you again.
not_available How have you been? Fine.
not_available So sad.
not_available I read about Manuel's death in the Times, and I just had to pay my respects.
not_available Oh, it's heartbreaking.
not_available The riots.
not_available I mean, the uprising was supposed to increase the peace, and all we have is more dead children.
not_available Did you know him? Oh, I feel I know all these innocent victims.
not_available This is not a good time.
not_available If you'd like to forward a card to the family
not_available Maybe I could just stay for a few minutes A card, I'll do that.
not_available You should have seen my baby.
not_available So happy, such a smile that could break your heart.
not_available What kind of God lets a baby like that get caught up in all that shit? Drugs, guns, death.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Bolin, I'm not gonna tell you that it's all gonna be OK, but it just takes time.
not_available This is as bad as it gets.
not_available I have nothing to live for.
not_available You have your husband.
not_available You have you.
not_available You have the memory of that little baby.
not_available You've got to keep that alive.
not_available My father died on Christmas Eve.
not_available And there's so much I never said, never knew about him, but he's a part of me, and Manny will always be a part of you.
not_available Why didn't God take me instead of my boy? I don't know.
not_available You gotta apologize to your boy, Keith.
not_available Otherwise you just a born bitch.
not_available You're speaking like this at your funeral? Damn straight.
not_available I'll say whatever I goddamned please.
not_available And I've been to a ton of funerals.
not_available You see one, you see them all.
not_available Even mine.
not_available No gunfire.
not_available No fights.
not_available No.
not_available No Sharks.
not_available No Jets.
not_available Just like any other funeral.
not_available You let down, huh? 
not_available A little.
not_available A Detective McBride just called.
not_available They made a determination of the house fire.
not_available They termed it "cause unknown.
not_available " So they ruled out arson.
not_available No.
not_available They just can't tell.
not_available Either way, the case is closed.
not_available Which doesn't rule out the possibility that Claire set that fire.
not_available She didn't do that, Nate.
not_available Well, what if she did, Mom? Pretending it didn't happen's not gonna help.
not_available I'm sorry about last night with Brenda.
not_available When you walked in on us.
not_available I know what you're talking about.
not_available Where have you been? None of your business.
not_available When did this become a police state? I need an altoid.
not_available The original sin wasn't eating the apple.
not_available It wasn't questioning authority.
not_available It was not giving God the chance to give his side of the argument.
not_available It was just taking the serpent's word as Gospel.
not_available It was not going back to God and saying, "Hey, what gives? He said you're lying to us.
not_available " It was just assuming that God lies.
not_available I'm sorry about the other day.
not_available Aren't you gonna say, "Hey, man, I'm sorry, too, for revealing my dormant psycho side, and scaring the shit out of you"? Nuh uh.
not_available Nuh uh.
not_available Do you really think I hate myself? Good to see you, David.
not_available I know where you are.
not_available I was there, and I'll wait for you, because I love you, but I'm not moving backwards for anybody.
not_available I'm not asking you to move backwards.
not_available I'm just asking you to be patient and a little calmer.
not_available Do you have any idea what I put up with on my job everyday? How many times the word "fag" has been written on my locker? How many times I wonder going into a dangerous situation if I'm even going to get backup? We were stepped on yesterday, David, and I did something about it, because I am tired of it.
not_available When you get tired of it, you let me know.
not_available Morning.
not_available Hi.
not_available You think I should make a peace offering to your mother? No, it'll just make things worse.
not_available I brought it up yesterday, she nearly bit my head off.
not_available Oh, Jesus.
not_available No accident you guys are undertakers.
not_available You take every fucking feeling you have, put it in a box, and bury it.
not_available Better that than examine every fucking moment until all of the joy is drained out of it.
not_available Come here.
not_available No.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Sex does not solve anything, Nate.
not_available Claire, are you OK? No.
not_available Do you wanna talk about it? Sure.
not_available My pimp's threatening to beat me up, because I can't turn enough tricks.
not_available What's worse is, he's threatening to take away my smack.
not_available Hell.
not_available Why do you always have to be such a bitch? Why do you always have to naturally assume I'm in trouble? Like you guys are such shining examples? Kroehner is going to keep strong
not_available arming our suppliers, undercutting us, stealing funerals.
not_available We're never gonna be able to compete in terms of size and market presence.
not_available Where we can compete is quality of service, integrity.
not_available We'll give them the human touch.
not_available It all sounds good.
not_available Is this over? Well, we have to get our message out there.
not_available We're gonna have to market and promote.
not_available Replace outmoded equipment and install computers.
not_available Fine.
not_available Now, in order to make this all work, we'll need a significant financial investment.
not_available How much? You want me to give you $93,000 from your father's life insurance? Nobody else is going to do it.
not_available We're still paying off a bank note Dad took out years ago.
not_available We hate to ask, Mom, but we're desperate.
not_available Of course, you're not obligated.
not_available I know that.
not_available When do you need it? Are you sure, Mom? But it's not a loan.
not_available I'm now an investor in Fisher &amp; Sons.
not_available We'll establish a fair percentage of equity and rate of return.
not_available I could invest in either my boys or tech stocks.
not_available Anything's better than the track.
not_available David, I'd like it if you'd come with me to church every once in a while, now that your father's gone.
not_available I shouldn't have to go alone.
not_available Uh
not_available OK.
not_available Well that was weird.
not_available It gets weirder.
not_available There was a message on my machine from Gilardi.
not_available He wants to meet with us.
not_available Today.
not_available Hey, dog.
not_available Gettin' ready to throw some blows? If you were me, Paco, what would you say to Gilardi? What would you do? If I was you? Shit, if I was you, I wouldn't own a fuckin' funeral home.
not_available But, awight, aw
not_available ight.
not_available Let's say, I'm doin' my thing, sellin' my shit, and some punk ass tries to clock me for my corner.
not_available You know what I'd say? I'd say, "Hear this, motherfucker.
not_available If I ever clock you near me, my corner, or my shit, I'll cut your fuckin' stomach, watch your guts spill out, and I'll let you live till you slowly bleed to death in front of your fuckin'kids.
not_available " Feel your heart racin'? Cause when the other guy feels like that, you won.
not_available Come on, David.
not_available You've gotta stand up.
not_available You gotta step up.
not_available Hey, you stepped up.
not_available Look what happened to you.
not_available That's right.
not_available For 20 years, I lived my life like a man.
not_available When are you gonna start? You lowered your offer.
not_available What can I say? The market fluctuates.
not_available Thanks, but we don't see a need to align ourselves with Kroehner right now.
not_available OK.
not_available I'll make it simple.
not_available You either accept our offer by the end of the day, or I'll make it my personal mission to bury you by the end of the month.
not_available David, you in on this suicide mission? David? You just threatened my family.
not_available Let's not be melodramatic.
not_available What do you expect us to do? Run and hide? Sell and be grateful? Pack up and move? If you're smart.
not_available You have the entire Kroehner organization behind you, and what do we have? You.
not_available Because one day, when your mind isn't on Fisher &amp; Sons, I will find you or someone you love I'm not saying anyone's gonna die.
not_available There are tragedies far worse than death.
not_available Things you couldn't even dream of, you spineless candy
not_available ass corporate fuck.
not_available Just give me a reason.
not_available It's your decision.
not_available Are we really worth the trouble, Mr.
not_available Gilardi? Lunch is over.
not_available Get lost.

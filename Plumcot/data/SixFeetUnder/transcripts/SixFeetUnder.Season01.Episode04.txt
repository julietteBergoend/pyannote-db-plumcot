detective_mcbride Ms Chenowith gave us her account of your activities at the crime scene .
nate_fisher Crime scene ?
nate_fisher So you're saying it was definitely arson ?
detective_shea What's your story , Mr .
detective_shea Fisher ?
nate_fisher Um the house is empty , I wanted to show Brenda where I used to hang out when I was a kid .
brenda_chenowith I don't know why he wanted to show it to me .
detective_mcbride Can you tell us what you did while you were there ?
brenda_chenowith Walked around , looked at things .
detective_shea Do you really expect us to believe you broke into an abandoned home just to walk around ?
brenda_chenowith Oh , we fucked .
detective_mcbride You said you were there for an hour or so ?
nate_fisher Tops .
detective_mcbride Could you walk us through what the two of you did for that hour ?
detective_shea Could you please be as specific as possible ?
detective_shea Just to establish a timeline .
brenda_chenowith Well , he went down on me for a while .
brenda_chenowith He's really good at it .
nate_fisher I don't exactly remember the specifics .
brenda_chenowith Oh , he was in a state .
brenda_chenowith Like he had a lot of aggression to work out .
nate_fisher She said that I was aggressive ?
nate_fisher Oh man , she should talk !
brenda_chenowith Then he fell asleep .
detective_shea What happened then ?
nate_fisher We were exhausted , so we left .
brenda_chenowith I left to meet somebody .
brenda_chenowith He was just waking up .
brenda_chenowith I don't know what he did after that .
brenda_chenowith Can I go ?
detective_mcbride I think we have everything that we need .
detective_mcbride Thank you for your cooperation .
brenda_chenowith Peace out , guys .
nate_fisher Well , yeah , she left first , but I left right after that .
detective_shea Are you aware that the property in question was recently purchased by Kroehner Service International ?
nate_fisher Yes , Matt Gilardi said they were planning to open a cheap cremation place and put us out of business .
detective_mcbride Was that the point where you called him a " greedy little Nazi fuck " ?
detective_mcbride Is that correct ?
nate_fisher Yes , that is correct .
nate_fisher You think I set the fire ?
detective_mcbride Well , you have to admit .
detective_mcbride It does seem like a beneficial turn of events for your business .
nate_fisher So what ?
nate_fisher Do I need a lawyer ?
detective_mcbride Not yet .
detective_mcbride You're free to go .
detective_shea Actually , one more thing .
detective_shea Do you know where your sister was the night of the fire ?
nate_fisher No .
nate_fisher Why ?
detective_mcbride I understand she had a run in with the law recently .
detective_mcbride A missing foot .
detective_shea If she's developing a pattern of acting out subsequent to her father's death Claire had nothing to do with that fire .
detective_shea How do you know ?
david_fisher I knew passing the health department inspection was too good to be true .
david_fisher It just meant something else would go wrong .
david_fisher Good , there goes a month's profit .
ruth_fisher We can live without air conditioning .
ruth_fisher Plenty of people do .
david_fisher Yeah , people in the third world .
david_fisher We can't run a business without air conditioning .
david_fisher If we lose any more funerals , Kroehner won't have to take us over .
david_fisher We'll be bankrupt .
ruth_fisher How much ?
david_fisher Central air ?
david_fisher 3 grand , easy .
nate_fisher Guess what ?
nate_fisher Gilardi tipped the cops off .
nate_fisher Think I'm a suspect .
david_fisher That's ridiculous .
nate_fisher Where's Claire ?
ruth_fisher School I hope .
nate_fisher Do either one of you know where she was before the fire ?
ruth_fisher Why ?
ruth_fisher What does it ?
ruth_fisher Oh , dear God .
ruth_fisher@a Oh , she couldn't have Good news , bad news .
a The compressor's fine .
a Bad news is your pneumatic activator sub is shot .
a Normally , I could do it in a day , but with this heatwave , better give me five days .
ruth_fisher Five ?
nate_fisher What's it gonna set us back ?
a Shouldn't take any more than 3700 , parts and labor .
david_fisher That's our 10:00 .
ruth_fisher Tell them we'll have air conditioning .
ruth_fisher Three days .
pacos_mother He would've been 21 next week .
pacos_mother We were gonna buy him a new bed .
pacos_mother Now we're buying him a coffin .
pacos_father He shouldn't have been out with that girl in that neighborhood .
nate_fisher It's the worst thing that could happen .
nate_fisher To lose a child .
pacos_mother We lost him years ago .
david_fisher We'll see to it that Paco . .
pacos_mother His name is Manny .
pacos_mother His . .
pacos_mother His gang name was Paco .
powerful He goes by Paco .
powerful And he wasn't lost .

david_fisher We'll see to it that he has a dignified service .
pacos_mother We've been to three funeral homes .
pacos_mother No one will take us .
nate_fisher We don't turn people away here .
david_fisher Butsometimes when families lack the funds necessary , or insurance
powerful I've got money .
pacos_father We don't want your money .
david_fisher Mr .
david_fisher Bolin , if your son is willing to finance .
not_available .
pacos_mother He's not our son .
pacos_father He's a gang leader .
pacos_father The Verato Kings .
pacos_father Don't you read the papers ?
powerful My name is Powerful .
powerful Paco's gonna have a fat ass funeral , whatever it costs .
powerful We've got mad cash , so long as y'all can do it up right .
powerful Now can y'all do it up right ?
powerful Or should we move on ?
david_fisher Uh , if you'll excuse me , Nate will show you some flower arrangements which might be to your liking .
nate_fisher Uh , lilies are always nice Federico , I need your help .
david_fisher Your expertise .
david_fisher I've got a really tough one upstairs .
federico_diaz Decomp ?
federico_diaz Crispy critter ?
david_fisher No .

david_fisher The family wants a traditional Mexican funeral .
federico_diaz Oh , what's a traditional Mexican funeral ?
david_fisher But there's this other guy , the deceased's gang leader
federico_diaz What does this have to do me ?
david_fisher I was hoping you would talk to them for me with me .
federico_diaz What ?
federico_diaz Because I'm Latino
federico_diaz I know about gangs ?
david_fisher Well , you probably know more than I do .
federico_diaz And why is that ?
david_fisher Well , I just assumed that , maybe , somebody in your family might No .
david_fisher Nobody in my family .
federico_diaz Never .
federico_diaz I've worked here for years , and you don't know a damn about me .
david_fisher That's not true .
federico_diaz You own an atlas ?
david_fisher An atlas ?
federico_diaz Yeah , because , if you did , you'd know there's a 2400 mile difference between Puerto Rico and Mexico .
david_fisher You're Puerto Rican ?
david_fisher Look , Federico , I'm sorry .
david_fisher I just assumed We can't afford to lose this funeral , and I'm afraid if Nate and I are the point of contact , we will .
federico_diaz This is our blue opal .
federico_diaz Two gage aluminum and copper with a light blue sovereign velvet interior .
pacos_father It's nicer than our car .
pacos_mother It's beautiful .
powerful It's not good enough .
federico_diaz Mrs .
federico_diaz Bolin , if this is the casket that you want for your son , then you should have it .
federico_diaz He is your son .
powerful Hey , where are you from , dog ?
federico_diaz One moment , please .
federico_diaz " Where are you from ? "
federico_diaz Like where were my parents born ?
federico_diaz San Loreso , Puerto Rico .
federico_diaz Where are you from ?
federico_diaz As in what gang I belong to ?
federico_diaz Yeah , I'll tell you what gang I belong to .
federico_diaz The gang that's gonna help you bury your friend .
federico_diaz The gang that's gonna be there for you and your friends when every other fuckin' home doesn't wanna deal with your tired ass bullshit .

federico_diaz Now , do you want me to help you or do you
federico_diaz just wanna go
federico_diaz heads up ?
powerful It's good .
david_fisher I don't like it .
david_fisher It's dangerous .
nate_fisher Not if we let Rico handle everything .
nate_fisher David , we're so white .
nate_fisher If we step in , we will totally fuck up .
ruth_fisher@nate_fisher Language Frankly , I'm more worried whether Claire started that fire .
david_fisher Why would she ?
david_fisher To help us out ?
david_fisher She hates us .
ruth_fisher Is Brenda a vegetarian ?
nate_fisher She'll eat anything .
nate_fisher Did you know the night that Dad died , Claire was high on crystal meth ?
david_fisher Oh my God !
david_fisher Isn't that a horse tranquilizer ?
nate_fisher No , it's speed .
nate_fisher Really nasty speed .
nate_fisher It makes you crazy .
ruth_fisher If there are things you don't want me to hear , go talk about them in another room
ruth_fisher I assume she drinks ?
nate_fisher You know , I can call and tell her to cancel .
ruth_fisher No , I've been looking forward to this .
david_fisher I have some errands to run .
david_fisher I'll pick up a nice chardonnay while I'm out .
ruth_fisher What errands ?
david_fisher Uh I can give you a list if you'd like .
david_fisher You guys , this kid at school today got busted for having a tazer , 'cause he showed it to his friends at lunch .
claire_fisher I mean , what an idiot !
claire_fisher There were like six cops !
claire_fisher It was absolutely hilarious !

keith_charles Who are you gonna call when the bullets start flying ?
david_fisher Anyone but you .
keith_charles You're damn straight .
keith_charles Claire's gonna need a lawyer .
keith_charles A good one .
david_fisher Look , if she set that fire , she'll do what's right .
david_fisher I'll see to it .
keith_charles What's right is getting her some top shelf legal counsel , and having her plead the fifth .
keith_charles I don't care what you have to do .
keith_charles Just keep her out of the system .
keith_charles She'll be eaten alive .
david_fisher Is there any chance you can snoop around and find out what their game plan is ?
keith_charles I don't know .
keith_charles I already interfered once .
redneck_suv_driver Are you guys pulling out or what ?

manuel_bolin What gives him the right to get up in your world ?
manuel_bolin To be so fuckin' . .
david_fisher So fucking self righteous .
manuel_bolin That's what I'm saying .
manuel_bolin You didn't call him nothing , but he went off on you .
manuel_bolin Yeah , I think he's got a problem with that stress management shit .
manuel_bolin Hell , maybe he's one of them rageaholics .
manuel_bolin I mean , that boy went off .
david_fisher I know .
david_fisher Just because some kid calls him a fag .
david_fisher It's so unnecessary .
manuel_bolin But he called you a fag , too .
david_fisher So ?
manuel_bolin So what'd you do ?
david_fisher Nothing .
manuel_bolin Mm hmm .
manuel_bolin When Peter stood and warmed himself , they said therefore unto him , " Art thou one of his disciples ? "
manuel_bolin He denied it and said , " I am not . "
david_fisher John 18:25 .
manuel_bolin No wonder he went off on you , man .

brenda_chenowith There's a lot of sadness in this house .

nate_fisher Where have you been ?
claire_fisher None of your business .
claire_fisher When did this become a police state ?
claire_fisher I need an altoid .
priest The original sin wasn't eating the apple .
priest It wasn't questioning authority .
priest It was not giving God the chance to give his side of the argument .
priest It was just taking the serpent's word as Gospel .
priest It was not going back to God and saying , " Hey , what gives ?
priest He said you're lying to us .
priest " It was just assuming that God lies .
david_fisher I'm sorry about the other day .
david_fisher Aren't you gonna say , " Hey , man , I'm sorry , too , for revealing my dormant psycho side , and scaring the shit out of you " ?
keith_charles Nuh uh .

david_fisher I'm not asking you to move backwards .
david_fisher I'm just asking you to be patient and a little calmer .
keith_charles Do you have any idea what I put up with on my job everyday ?
keith_charles How many times the word " fag " has been written on my locker ?
keith_charles How many times I wonder going into a dangerous situation if I'm even going to get backup ?

keith_charles When you get tired of it , you let me know .

brenda_chenowith No accident you guys are undertakers .
brenda_chenowith You take every fucking feeling you have , put it in a box , and bury it .

david_fisher Kroehner is going to keep strong arming our suppliers , undercutting us , stealing funerals .
david_fisher We're never gonna be able to compete in terms of size and market presence .
nate_fisher Where we can compete is quality of service , integrity .
nate_fisher We'll give them the human touch .
ruth_fisher It all sounds good .
ruth_fisher Is this over ?
nate_fisher Well , we have to get our message out there .
nate_fisher We're gonna have to market and promote .
david_fisher Replace outmoded equipment and install computers .
ruth_fisher Fine .
nate_fisher Now , in order to make this all work , we'll need a significant financial investment .
ruth_fisher How much ?
david_fisher You want me to give you $93,000 from your father's life insurance ?
david_fisher Nobody else is going to do it .
david_fisher We're still paying off a bank note Dad took out years ago .
nate_fisher We hate to ask , Mom , but we're desperate .
david_fisher Of course , you're not obligated .
ruth_fisher I know that .
ruth_fisher When do you need it ?
nate_fisher Are you sure , Mom ?
ruth_fisher But it's not a loan .
ruth_fisher I'm now an investor in Fisher &amp ; Sons .
ruth_fisher We'll establish a fair percentage of equity and rate of return .
ruth_fisher I could invest in either my boys or tech stocks .
ruth_fisher Anything's better than the track .
ruth_fisher David , I'd like it if you'd come with me to church every once in a while , now that your father's gone .
ruth_fisher I shouldn't have to go alone .
david_fisher Uh OK .
nate_fisher Well that was weird .
david_fisher It gets weirder .
david_fisher There was a message on my machine from Gilardi .
david_fisher He wants to meet with us .
david_fisher Today .
manuel_bolin Hey , dog .
manuel_bolin Gettin' ready to throw some blows ?
david_fisher If you were me , Paco , what would you say to Gilardi ?
david_fisher What would you do ?
manuel_bolin If I was you ?
manuel_bolin Shit , if I was you , I wouldn't own a fuckin' funeral home .
manuel_bolin But , awight , aw ight .
manuel_bolin Let's say , I'm doin'
manuel_bolin my thing , sellin' my shit , and some punk ass tries to clock me for my corner .
manuel_bolin You know what I'd say ?
manuel_bolin I'd say , " Hear this , motherfucker .
manuel_bolin " Feel your heart racin' ?
manuel_bolin Cause when the other guy feels like that , you won .
manuel_bolin Come on , David .
manuel_bolin You've gotta stand up .
manuel_bolin You gotta step up .
david_fisher Hey , you stepped up .
david_fisher Look what happened to you .
manuel_bolin That's right .
manuel_bolin For 20 years , I lived my life like a man .
manuel_bolin When are you gonna start ?
nate_fisher You lowered your offer .
matthew_gilardi What can I say ?
matthew_gilardi The market fluctuates .
nate_fisher Thanks , but we don't see a need to align ourselves with Kroehner right now .
matthew_gilardi OK .
matthew_gilardi I'll make it simple .
matthew_gilardi You either accept our offer by the end of the day , or I'll make it my personal mission to bury you by the end of the month .
matthew_gilardi David , you in on this suicide mission ?
nate_fisher David ?
david_fisher You just threatened my family .
matthew_gilardi Let's not be melodramatic .
david_fisher What do you expect us to do ?
david_fisher Run and hide ?
david_fisher Sell and be grateful ?
david_fisher Pack up and move ?
matthew_gilardi If you're smart .
david_fisher You have the entire Kroehner organization behind you , and what do we have ?
david_fisher You .
david_fisher Because one day , when your mind isn't on Fisher &amp ; Sons , I will find you or someone you love
david_fisher I'm not saying anyone's gonna die .
david_fisher There are tragedies far worse than death .
david_fisher Things you couldn't even dream of , you spineless candy ass corporate fuck .

david_fisher It's your decision .
david_fisher Are we really worth the trouble , Mr .
david_fisher Gilardi ?

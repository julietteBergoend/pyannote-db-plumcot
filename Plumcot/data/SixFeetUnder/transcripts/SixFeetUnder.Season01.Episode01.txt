nathaniel_fisher Nathaniel Fisher .
nathaniel_fisher /
ruth_fisher Nathaniel ?
ruth_fisher It's Ruth .
ruth_fisher Did you take your blood pressure medication today ? /
nathaniel_fisher Yes .
ruth_fisher Don't lie to me .
nathaniel_fisher I took it .
nathaniel_fisher What do you want me to do ?
nathaniel_fisher O.D .
nathaniel_fisher on it ?
ruth_fisher Oh , I just realized .
ruth_fisher We don't have any of that soy stuff natraxe , you know , since you gave up milk .
ruth_fisher I don't know what it's called .
nathaniel_fisher Why not just cut some milk with tap water ?
nathaniel_fisher I'll never know the difference .
ruth_fisher Look , if you don't want to go , I'll go .
ruth_fisher It's not as if I don't have enough to do already .
nathaniel_fisher I'm kidding .
nathaniel_fisher I'll get some , but it has to be after I pick up Nate at the airport .
nathaniel_fisher I'm already running late .
ruth_fisher Nathaniel , are you smoking ?
nathaniel_fisher /
nathaniel_fisher Nope .
ruth_fisher Yes , you are .
ruth_fisher I heard you .
nathaniel_fisher I'm not .
nathaniel_fisher No , I'm not .
ruth_fisher / Look .
ruth_fisher Forget you'll give yourself cancer and die a slow and horrible death .
ruth_fisher You should not be stinking up that new hearse .
david_fisher I told you not to let him take it .
ruth_fisher Like I could have stopped him .
ruth_fisher He's every bit as proud of that thing as your fool brother was of that damn motorcycle he had in high school .
ruth_fisher And who still has a pin in his foot ?
ruth_fisher Nathaniel , people want things to be nice when there's a funeral .
ruth_fisher They don't want their loved ones riding around in something that smells like an ashtray .
nathaniel_fisher Alright , alright .
nathaniel_fisher Look , I'm quitting right now , I promise .
nathaniel_fisher Okay ?
nathaniel_fisher I'll see you tonight .
david_fisher That new hearse was a total waste of money .
david_fisher There was nothing wrong with the old one .
ruth_fisher I think your father is having some sort of midlife crisis .
david_fisher It would have made so much more sense to invest in re paneling for the chapel or adding coffee bars to the slumber rooms .
ruth_fisher Well , I'd much rather he buy himself a fancy new hearse than leave me for a younger woman , or a woman my age for that matter , or , heaven forbid , a man , like my cousin
ruth_fisher Hannah's husband did .
ruth_fisher God sure has dealt that woman some blows in this life .
david_fisher Mom , can I do anything to help ?
ruth_fisher No , no , honey .
ruth_fisher I'm fine .
ruth_fisher Besides , don't you have a viewing tonight ?
ruth_fisher You should probably be getting ready .
david_fisher Right .
nate_fisher So I enjoyed talking to you about that whole shiatsu thing .
nate_fisher I hope that pans out for you .
brenda_chenowith You should let me work on you sometime .
nate_fisher Well , here's my cell number .
nate_fisher I'll be here until the 29th .
nate_fisher Here ya go .
nate_fisher Huh , my dad is supposed to meet me here .
brenda_chenowith I could give you a ride .
nate_fisher That's alright .
nate_fisher I'm sure he'll be here soon enough .
brenda_chenowith I wasn't talking about that kind of ride .
elderly_man You've done a nice job .
elderly_man She looks so peaceful .
david_fisher Well , she is at peace now .
elderly_man If there's any justice in the universe , she's shoveling shit in hell .
david_fisher Excuse me .
david_fisher David Fisher . /
claire_fisher David Claire .
claire_fisher Is Nate there yet ? /
not_available Nope .

claire_fisher forced Christmas eve family thing .

nate_fisher Oh , yeah .
nate_fisher Me
nate_fisher neither .
nate_fisher So are you ever gonna tell me your name ?
brenda_chenowith Probably not .

nate_fisher That's my father looking for me .
nate_fisher Hey , Dad .
nate_fisher Oh , Dave .
nate_fisher Hey .
nate_fisher Merry Christmas .
nate_fisher Of course I'm OK Couldn't be better , in fact

david_fisher I'm so sorry , Nate .
david_fisher I hate to have to be the one to tell you .
claire_fisher This is just speed , right ?
claire_fisher Promise me this isn't crack .
claire_fisher Because I gotta spend tonight having Christmas Eve dinner with my demented family
claire_fisher and it's gonna be weird enough without me being high on crack .
gabe_dimas No .
gabe_dimas It's just crystal meth .
gabe_dimas It just makes everything burn a little bit brighter .
gabe_dimas And it makes sex like totally primal .
gabe_dimas Here .
gabe_dimas It's alright .
claire_fisher Oh , well .
claire_fisher It's too late now .
claire_fisher It's mine .
claire_fisher Hello ?

gabe_dimas Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
gabe_dimas You're coming back , right ?
claire_fisher Uh , I don't think so .
claire_fisher My dad just got hit by a bus , and it broke his neck , and he's dead .
claire_fisher I gotta go pick up my mom and take her to the morgue so she can identify his body .
claire_fisher No , I'm not kidding .
claire_fisher This is actually happening .
claire_fisher And now I'm high on crack !
gabe_dimas Crystal . /
claire_fisher Whatever !
claire_fisher So I guess this whole hellish experience I'm about to go through
claire_fisher is just gonna burn a little brighter now , right ?
claire_fisher Great !
claire_fisher Thank you !
claire_fisher Fuck !
nate_fisher You really didn't have to do this .
nate_fisher I could have just rented a car .
brenda_chenowith It's OK .
brenda_chenowith You're in no shape to drive , and frankly , I'm in no hurry to get home to my family's annual Christmas Eve massacre .
brenda_chenowith Parents who stayed together for the children , but really because they got off on tormenting each other so much .
brenda_chenowith Manic depressive brother who always chooses the holidays to go off his medication .
brenda_chenowith Oh , and an ancient Springer Spaniel who's completely blind , deaf , and incontinent .
brenda_chenowith What about you ?
nate_fisher Uh , actually , we're pretty normal .
nate_fisher My mom's a control freak .
nate_fisher My brother , well , he's a control freak , too .
nate_fisher And my sister , well , I left home right before she was born , so
nate_fisher I never really knew her that well , but she's kind of wild
nate_fisher like I was .
brenda_chenowith Was ?
nate_fisher My dad really rode my ass when I was a kid .
nate_fisher He'd just buried this girl who drowned , and buried this dipshit loser who O.D.ed at a Flock of Seagulls concert , and suddenly I'm not allowed to go to concerts for a year .
brenda_chenowith Your dad worked in a cemetery ?
nate_fisher How could a man who's so fucking scared of everything , who never had an accident , or even a speeding ticket in his entire fucking life how could he have a car wreck ?
brenda_chenowith Are you mad at him or the fact that we're all gonna die ?
nate_fisher Are you a shrink ?
brenda_chenowith No , God !
brenda_chenowith No !
not_available No !
brenda_chenowith Both my parents are .
brenda_chenowith So what else do you wanna talk about ?
brenda_chenowith The weather ?
brenda_chenowith Or the fact that we both just fucked a perfect stranger and that we both lied when we said we never did that ?
mr_bloomberg Wonderful service .
crying_sicilian_daughter Yes , it was very nice .
mr_bloomberg Should we ? /
crying_sicilian_mother Yes , dear .
crying_sicilian_daughter She looked so peaceful .
david_fisher You're welcome .
not_available /
crying_sicilian_daughter Wonderful job .
ruth_fisher Did you know that before you were born , funeral homes ran the ambulance business ?
ruth_fisher Hearses were the only vehicles that could transport people lying down .
not_available No .
claire_fisher Wow .
ruth_fisher Your father used to joke about that .
ruth_fisher Just drive him around the block a few more times .
ruth_fisher We won?t need to stop at the hospital .
claire_fisher You're kind of freaking me out right now .
ruth_fisher Claire , are you having sex ?
not_available What ?
ruth_fisher Doing drugs ?
claire_fisher Why are you asking me this right now ?
not_available Your father is dead .
ruth_fisher I can't even remember the last time you and I talked about anything important .
ruth_fisher I need to know you're OK .
claire_fisher Yeah .
claire_fisher Believe me ,
claire_fisher I'm OK , considering .
tracy_montrose_blair Do you work here ?
not_available Yes .
tracy_montrose_blair I wanted to compliment you on the music .
tracy_montrose_blair I've been to three other funerals this year cancer , stroke , pediatric leukemia and the music is always that same , sad organ music .
tracy_montrose_blair It reminds me of those soap operas my mom used to watch before I started kindergarten .
tracy_montrose_blair Oh , God .
tracy_montrose_blair You're probably too young to remember that .
tracy_montrose_blair Anyway , I so prefer this light , classical , you know , chamber orchestra stuff .
tracy_montrose_blair It's so spiritual , but doesn't seem so dated , or depressing .
tracy_montrose_blair I studied musical appreciation. .
tracy_montrose_blair You think I'm really boring , don't you ?
tracy_montrose_blair Well , get used to it !
tracy_montrose_blair Because now that your father is dead , you can forget about ever going to law school .
tracy_montrose_blair It's just you and dead people and freaks like me for the rest of your life !
nate_fisher Mom , I'm so sorry .
ruth_fisher Who's she ?
brenda_chenowith Brenda Chenowith .
nate_fisher / Brenda Chenowith .
ruth_fisher Oh .
nate_fisher Brenda , this is my mom , Ruth Fisher , and my sister , Claire .
claire_fisher Nate , can I talk to you for a second ?
nate_fisher Yeah ,
nate_fisher yeah , just give me a minute .
nate_fisher Mom you already do the
ruth_fisher I can't .
ruth_fisher I've seen too many dead people in my life .
not_available They're work .
not_available I won't see your father that way .
not_available I need you to do it .
not_available Nate , I need to talk to you now , please , it's urgent .
not_available /
not_available So how did you and my son meet ?
not_available In cooking class .
not_available I have to tell somebody .
not_available I am tweaking .
not_available Yeah .
not_available We're all upset .
not_available /
not_available No , I'm high on crystal .
not_available I smoked some with some friends before David called me .
not_available You did what ? /
not_available Don't worry .
not_available It's the first time , but I think I'm having a meltdown
not_available and I can't tell if it's Dad being dead or the crystal ,
not_available but I'm really scared .
not_available You cannot do this to me right now .
not_available Don't be such a narc .
not_available We smoked pot at Thanksgiving .
not_available Look , I have to go identify our dead father's body .
not_available I'm sorry you're having a bad drug experience , but deal with it !
not_available Well ?
not_available Well , well , the prodigal returns .
not_available This is what you've been running away from your whole life , buddy boy .
not_available Scared the crap out of you when you were growing up , didn't it ?
not_available And you thought you'd escape .
not_available Well , guess what ?
not_available Nobody escapes !
not_available Well ?
not_available Yeah , it's him .
not_available OK , let's get out of here .
not_available How'd he look ?
not_available Dead .
not_available Will there need to be a lot of reconstruction ?
not_available David's not that skilled at the really hard stuff .
not_available Federico usually does that .
not_available He's quite gifted .
not_available You don't think we'll have to have a closed casket , do you ?
not_available I would hate to send that message .
not_available What message ? /
not_available That we're not equipped to handle a major restoration or that we're not proud of our work .
not_available /
not_available Mom .
not_available Can we talk about this later ?
not_available We should really get Nate home .
not_available He's probably exhausted .
not_available Let's go .
not_available Um .
not_available Thanks for driving me here .
not_available Please .
not_available Just avoiding my own hell .
not_available I'm a big coward .
not_available Me , too .
not_available I don't know if I can handle this .
not_available Well , you're about to find out .
not_available I wish you the best , Nate .
not_available Goodbye .
not_available Claire , you're driving too fast .
not_available This isn't fast .
not_available You wanna see fast ?
not_available PULL OVER !
not_available Listen , do you do a lot of drugs ?
not_available What ?
not_available No .
not_available And it's none of your business .
not_available Yes , it is my business .
not_available Look , you were driving like a maniac back there .
not_available You could have gotten us all killed .
not_available What the hell is this ?
not_available You're not my father !
not_available Look , you split as soon as you could .
not_available You don't even know me , so don't start thinking you can tell me what to do , OK ?
not_available So , where's Dad ?
not_available Downstairs already ?
not_available He's still in the morgue .
not_available You didn't bring him back with you ?
not_available Oh , dear .
not_available It didn't even cross my mind .
not_available We should have taken the van so we could bring him home .
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available That was very stupid of me .
not_available Nice going , Dave .
not_available Like she doesn't have enough to feel bad about right now .
not_available Things have to be done .
not_available Federico's downstairs ready to start .
not_available Every second that we wait will only make Dad?s restoration more difficult .
not_available But you wouldn't know about that , would you , bag boy ?
not_available Bag boy ?
not_available I am assistant manager of organic produce at the highest buying food co op in Seattle .
not_available Jesus , pull your dicks out and measure them , and let?s get this over with !
not_available What were we supposed to do ?
not_available Throw Dad in the back of Claire's car ?
not_available It is a hearse !
not_available Yeah , hi .
not_available It's David Fisher .
not_available Yes .
not_available I'll come pick up the body .
not_available I made you some dinner .
not_available I'm so not hungry .
not_available We have to eat , Claire .
not_available We didn't die !
not_available Ready ?
not_available One .
not_available Two .
not_available Three .
not_available I'm really sorry , man .
not_available Thanks .
not_available For a body that's firm , yet flexible .
not_available For skin that begs to be touched .
not_available For the velvety appearance of actual living tissue , top morticians rely on Living Splendor Enbalming Fluid .
not_available Living Splendor
not_available Only real life is better ?
not_available Hey , buddy boy .
not_available Come on in .
not_available It's okay .
not_available Say hello to Mr .
not_available Bloomberg .
not_available There isn't anything to be afraid of , Nate .
not_available Mr .
not_available Bloomberg is dead .
not_available I'm getting him ready so his family can see him for the last time and say goodbye to him .
not_available It'll make them feel better .
not_available That's what Daddy does .
not_available Bang !
not_available You got me !
not_available You can touch him , if you wear one of these .
not_available Believe me , he won't mind .
not_available He won't care .
not_available Nate !
not_available What's up ?
not_available Hey , Rico .
not_available /
not_available It's good to see you .
not_available Oh , really sorry about your dad , man , but , you know , when your time is up , it's up , right ?
not_available How's he doing ?
not_available So far , so good .
not_available I really appreciate you coming in on Christmas Eve , Federico .
not_available It's the least I can do for Mr .
not_available F. Everything he did for me .
not_available I'd be up all night , anyway , putting together all this useless shit Santa Claus is bringing my kid , you know ?
not_available We don't use that kind of language in here .
not_available Show some respect .
not_available You need something ?
not_available No , I just , um David Fisher .
not_available Hey , listen , I just want to remind you .
not_available Don't eat too much with your family tonight , alright ?
not_available Because I am making you something totally decadent and fatty for dessert .
not_available Hold just a second , please .
not_available Hi , Keith .
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available I can't make it .
not_available Why not ?
not_available Because my father was just killed in a car accident .
not_available Oh , shit , David , I'm so sorry .
not_available What can I do ?
not_available Nothing .
not_available Thanks .
not_available I have to stay here .
not_available Listen .
not_available If you need anything , don't hesitate to call me .
not_available Sure .
not_available I mean it , David .
not_available You don't have to go through this alone .
not_available I've gotta go .
not_available OK , here it goes .
not_available This is the one I'm most proud of .
not_available The husband , OK , got fired , flipped out , shot his wife point blank in the head , right ?
not_available And then turned it around and shot himself in the mouth .
not_available Some seriously closed casket shit , right ?
not_available Now look at this .
not_available Huh ?
not_available Hah !
not_available Hah !
not_available Like the bride and groom on top of cake !
not_available And then we cremated them .
not_available What a fricking waste .
not_available Actually , this right here is my best work .
not_available Wait a minute .
not_available This kid was just born like last month .
not_available Be four fucking years old in April .
not_available Can you believe it ?
not_available Shit !
not_available Oh Vanessa's pregnant again !
not_available Hey , you stud !
not_available Hey , it wasn't planned .
not_available But , you know what , neither was this one , and he's the best thing that ever happened to me .
not_available Keep an eye on those chemicals , Federico .
not_available We don't want him to burn .
not_available Hey .
not_available Where's Mom ? /
not_available She went to bed .
not_available Was she feeling any better ?
not_available Yeah , Nate .
not_available She was on top of the goddamned world .
not_available Where's David ?
not_available He's downstairs working .
not_available On Dad ?
not_available Yeah , well , him and Rico .
not_available Said not to wait up for him .
not_available We should just try and get some sleep .
not_available Yeah .
not_available As if that were a viable option .
not_available Do you wanna go to the grocery store ?
not_available Yes .
not_available Anything to get out of here .
not_available Hello ?
not_available Well , it's about to start raining frogs here .
not_available How are things on your end ?
not_available God , I'm glad you called .
not_available Really ?
not_available Why ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available Because you have a calming effect on me .
not_available Uh huh .
not_available Are you familiar with the psychological term , " projection " ?
not_available Are you familiar with the psychological term , " blow me " ?
not_available Come on .
not_available You're up with all that psychobabble .
not_available Rebelled against it every chance you got , still do , and that includes having sex with strangers in closets at airports .
not_available And you think you're not easy to read ?
not_available Coasting by on your looks and charm isn't working like it used to , but you have no idea what else to do , because you've never had to learn .
not_available Any woman with half a brain looks at a guy like you and thinks , " Good for a hot fuck , but , believe me , that's it .
not_available / I Nate , can we go home ?
not_available "
not_available I've really got to take a shower .
not_available Oh , God , Jesus Christ , am I not allowed to have even a single moment to myself ?
not_available OK .
not_available It's OK .
not_available What can I do ?
not_available No one can do anything .
not_available Nothing .
not_available You'll have to pay for that canteloupe .
not_available WILL YOU FUCK OFF?! ?
not_available She looked her best every day of her life .
not_available Don't let one horribly disfiguring accident change that .
not_available Use new Wound Filler Cosmetic Molding Putty .
not_available Now fastersetting and self sealing .
not_available To help make masking unsightly wounds a breeze ?
not_available Ma , you remember that stuffed dog I used to have and dragged it around till its ears fells off , and then you made new ears out of a dishtowel ?
not_available I hated that dog after that , and I threw it up on the roof .
not_available No .
not_available Then I wanted it back , and I begged Dad to go get it , but he said " No .
not_available " If I'd really wanted it , I never would have thrown it up there in the first place .
not_available Your father did so many wonderful things for you , and that's all you can think of right now ?
not_available I just remembered . /
not_available He was a good man !
not_available I'm going running .
not_available Oh , no .
not_available You're doing me ?
not_available You're the worst one we've got .
not_available Thanks , Dad .
not_available Where's Federico ?
not_available It's Christmas morning .
not_available He's with his wife and kid .
not_available He'll be in later .
not_available Oh , couldn't this wait ?
not_available I don't want you ruining my face .
not_available It's a little late for that .
not_available /
not_available Not funny .
not_available I need to stay busy right now .
not_available So go reorganize some files , or develop a new bookkeeping system .
not_available That's what you're good at .
not_available You never really had an aptitude for this stuff .
not_available I know .
not_available What did I do with my life ?
not_available I went to school to learn exactly how to do this stuff .
not_available Other kids my age were going to frat parties .
not_available I was draining corpses and refashioning severed ears out of wax .
not_available Thank God I didn't lose an ear .
not_available I can only imagine what you'd do with that .
not_available I did it all for you .
not_available I did it to make you happy , you ungrateful son of a bitch .
not_available Um , Dave , yeah , I just wanted to let you know I was here .
not_available We'll deal you in next hand .
not_available Well , I'm about to jump out of my skin .
not_available Don't .
not_available I'm just barely holding it together .
not_available Are you still high ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available Am I sweating ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available I am .
not_available This is too fucking weird .
not_available It's been like three days .
not_available I'm still stuck in Zombie World .
not_available This is all happening to you .
not_available Fuck off .
not_available Sorry , but you're not the only one who wasn't prepared for this .
not_available I came home expecting to sleep late and chow down on Mom's cooking for six days , and now I find myself feeling like I'm not even a part of this family .
not_available Well , I'd trade places with you in a heartbeat .
not_available What ?
not_available At least you got out of here .
not_available I live in a shitty apartment , which was supposed to be temporary .
not_available I work at a job , which was also supposed to be temporary until I figured out what I really wanted to do with my life , which apparently is nothing .
not_available I have lots of sex , but I haven't had a relationship last more than a couple of months .
not_available I don't even have the self discipline to floss daily .
not_available I've had four root canals .
not_available Four .
not_available I am 35 .
not_available I've had four root canals .
not_available I'm gonna be one of those losers who ends up on his deathbed , saying " Where'd my life go?
not_available No , you won't .
not_available "
not_available You'll be saying , " Where the hell's the morphine?
not_available " I'm just trying to cheer you up .
not_available I've spent my whole fucking life being cheerful .
not_available I am sorry about your father , but he's in a much better place now .
not_available You are so right about that .
not_available Who the hell is that?! ?
not_available I know , Ruth .
not_available I know everything .
not_available I've known the Fishers for years from church .
not_available Mm hmm .
not_available You know them too ?
not_available Yes , yes , I work here .
not_available /
not_available Oh , you work here .
not_available Mm hmm .
not_available What are you doing here ?
not_available Just got off duty .
not_available I came to pay my respects to your father .
not_available You never even met my father .
not_available Exactly .
not_available And you've met my parents how many times now ?
not_available Christ , we just spent the weekend at their house .
not_available Don't do this to me , Keith .
not_available This is not your high school reunion .
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available /
not_available This is not the time for you to be political .
not_available You think that's why I'm here ?
not_available To be political ?
not_available Would you keep your voice down ?
not_available /
not_available What is this ?
not_available We can fuck each other , but I can't be a shoulder for you to cry on ?
not_available I'm not crying .
not_available /
not_available So what am I ?
not_available Am I just sex to you ? /
not_available Jesus !
not_available Do we really have to have this conversation now ?
not_available Oh , shit !
not_available Here comes my mother .
not_available I'm so tired .
not_available I know , Mom .
not_available It's exhausting .
not_available Is something wrong ?
not_available No , nothing's wrong .
not_available This is Keith Charles .
not_available He's a friend of mine .
not_available He came to pay his respects to Dad .
not_available It's nice to meet you , Mrs .
not_available Fisher .
not_available I'm really sorry about your husband .
not_available You're friends with a cop ?
not_available We play racquetball together .
not_available Oh .
not_available Nice to meet you .
not_available I'd like to see your father now .
not_available Who's that cop ?
not_available My aunt Shirley was laid out here .
not_available Aunt Shirley , huh ?
not_available /
not_available Mm hmm .
not_available Shirley Hamilton .
not_available Terrible accident .
not_available Lost her ear .
not_available Oh , yeah !
not_available Yeah !
not_available I know Shirley !
not_available I remember Shirley ! /
not_available Really?! ?
not_available Yes , yes .
not_available I was the person who sewed her ear back on .
not_available That was me . /
not_available Really ?
not_available /
not_available That's my work .
not_available What , she's sad , so he has to get her out of sight ?
not_available They always do that the second someone starts to lose it .
not_available They take them off into that room .
not_available It makes all the other people uncomfortable , I guess .
not_available This is not about the other people .
not_available Volume ?
not_available When I went backpacking through Europe after I quit school , I went to this island off the coast of Sicily .
not_available This volcanic island .
not_available And on the boat over , there was this pine box .
not_available Somebody from the island who was being returned to be buried there , and there were all these old Sicilians dressed up all in black , waiting , just lined up on the beach .
not_available And when they got that coffin to the beach , these old Sicilian women just went apeshit , screaming , throwing themselves on it , beating their chests , tearing at their hair , making animal noises .
not_available It was just so so real .
not_available I mean , I'd been around funerals my entire life , but I had never seen such grief .
not_available And at the time , it gave me the creeps , but. .
not_available now I think it's probably so much more healthy than this .
not_available That cop is hot .
not_available Oh , David .
not_available David .
not_available I know , Mom .
not_available It's gonna be OK .
not_available It just takes time .
not_available I've done a terrible , terrible thing .
not_available What ?
not_available I've done a terrible thing .
not_available /
not_available What's she doing ?
not_available She's fine .
not_available I'm not fine .
not_available I'm a whore !
not_available I was unfaithful to your father for years , and now he knows , he knows !
not_available Uh I met a man at church once when your father didn't come with me .
not_available Mom
not_available /
not_available And he invited me for coffee .
not_available He said he liked my hair .
not_available He's a hairdresser , a widower .
not_available Well , they divorced before she died , so , technically , I guess , he's divorced .
not_available He invited me to accompany him on a hike .
not_available This is really not the time .
not_available I didn't even have the right shoes .
not_available I wore sandals .
not_available Maybe she needs to just get this out .
not_available Well , I don't want to hear it .
not_available I used to love hiking when I was younger , and being outdoors .
not_available I always wanted to take you kids camping , but your father would never leave the business .
not_available Well , I can tell you , I went camping with this man from church several times !
not_available Told your father I was visiting my sister , whom he never thought to call !
not_available Can you even begin to fathom the impropriety of this ?
not_available Your husband is lying in a casket out there .
not_available David , she's grief stricken , OK ?
not_available Fuck propriety !
not_available /
not_available We don't say that word !
not_available Did you know him ?
not_available No .
not_available Did you ?
not_available He was my father .
not_available You're Claire ?
not_available Yeah .
not_available Keith Charles .
not_available I'm a friend of your brother's .
not_available Of Nate's ?
not_available /
not_available No , David's .
not_available David's friends with a cop?! ?
not_available We play racquetball together .
not_available David plays racquetball?! ?
not_available / Excuse us .
not_available Do you want me to cry on your shoulder ? /
not_available Fine .
not_available My mother just confessed she was having an affair .
not_available Wow .
not_available /
not_available Yeah .
not_available With some hairdresser .
not_available Who likes to hike .
not_available Now fucking Nate is in there , playing Mr .
not_available Sensitive with her , while her dead husband lies in the next room .
not_available It's disgusting .
not_available Hey , breathe .
not_available Alright ?
not_available You're gonna get through this .
not_available Oh , I know .
not_available I'll be the strong one .
not_available The strong one .
not_available The dependable one .
not_available Because that's what I do .
not_available Everyone around me will fall apart , because that's what they do .
not_available Don't you get exhausted being so hard on everyone and yourself ?
not_available Oh , shut up .
not_available She met him at church .
not_available You met me at church .
not_available Hands .
not_available I didn't even realize how lonely I was , or how long it had been since a man touched me like that .
not_available Well , loneliness is a terrible thing .
not_available I'm still a woman , you know .
not_available Yes , I know .
not_available And now your father sees me , and God sees me .
not_available He knows everything .
not_available I'm so ashamed .
not_available You didn't do it to hurt anybody .
not_available You were lonely .
not_available I'm sure Dad forgives you .
not_available And God doesn't?! ?
not_available Oh ,
not_available yeah .
not_available Yeah .
not_available I'm sure He does , too .
not_available Look , it's OK .
not_available Everybody forgives everybody for everything .
not_available Looking for the olives , honey ?
not_available They're right here .
not_available Ashes to ashes and dust to dust is easy as pie with Franklin's New Leak Proof Earth Dispenser .
not_available Say goodbye to soiled fingers forever !
not_available Only from Franklin Funeral Supplies .
not_available We put the " fun " back in funeral ?
not_available In the midst of life , we are in death .
not_available Of whom may we seek for succor , but of thee , O Lord , who for our sins are justly displeased ?
not_available Thou knowest , Lord , the secrets of our hearts .
not_available Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer , but spare us , Lord most holy ,
not_available O God most mighty , O Holy and Merciful Savior , thou most worthy Judge Eternal .
not_available Suffer us not at our last hour through any pains of death to fall from thee .
not_available To the sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life , to Almighty God we commend our brother , Nathaniel Samuel Fisher , and we commit his body to the ground .
not_available It's like he's selling popcorn .
not_available Earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust .
not_available The Lord bless him and keep him , the Lord make his face to shine upon Him and be gracious unto Him .
not_available The Lord lift up his countenance upon him and give him peace .
not_available Nate . /
not_available No !
not_available I refuse to sanitize this anymore .
not_available This is how it's done .
not_available Yeah ?
not_available Well , it's whacked .
not_available What is this stupid saltshaker ?
not_available Huh ?
not_available What is this hermetically sealed box ?
not_available This phony Astroturf around the grave ?
not_available Jesus , David , it's like surgery .
not_available Clean , antiseptic , business .
not_available He was our father !
not_available /
not_available Please don't do this .
not_available You can pump him full of chemicals .
not_available You can put makeup on him , and you can prop him up for a nap in the slumber room , but the fact remains , David , that the only father we're ever going to have is gone .
not_available Forever .
not_available And that sucks , but it's a goddamned part of life , and you can't really accept it without getting your hands dirty .
not_available Well , I do accept it , and I intend to honor the old bastard by letting the whole world see just how fucked up and shitty
not_available I feel that he's dead !
not_available God damn it !
not_available Um ?
not_available Amen .
not_available Wait .
not_available Let her .
not_available Let us pray .
not_available Our Father who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name
not_available Amen ! /
not_available Amen !
not_available Amen !
not_available The Lord be with you .
not_available Mom , Federico is gonna drive you back , OK ?
not_available I just need to go over a few details with Nate .
not_available We'll be right behind you .
not_available There , there , Mrs . F. You have such delicate hands , Federico .
not_available Like a statue or an illustration in an antique book or one of those little ceramic hands they use to display gloves .
not_available You wanna be the Alpha dog , is that it ?
not_available You're coasting towards midlife with nothing to show for it , and now you wanna come back and be the rock for this family to lean on ?
not_available Fuck you . /
not_available That is not what I'm
not_available You want to get your hands dirty ?
not_available You sanctimonious prick .
not_available Talk to me when you've had to stuff
not_available formaldehyde soaked cotton up your father's ass
not_available so he doesn't leak .
not_available Jesus ! /
not_available Yeah ,
not_available well I'm sure you just would have tossed him out with the garbage .
not_available It may seem weird to you , but there is a reason behind everything that we do here .
not_available We provide people with a very important and sacred service at the darkest time in their lives , because maybe they don't want to make a spectacle of themselves .
not_available Because maybe they'd prefer to grieve in private .
not_available Why ?
not_available Why does it have to be such a secret ?
not_available It's nothing to be ashamed of .
not_available Dave , please .
not_available /
not_available You know nothing !
not_available Nothing !
not_available You had a responsibility towards this family , and you ran away from it , and you left it all for me .
not_available Whoa .
not_available Don't blame me if you're not living the life you want .
not_available That is nobody's fault but your own .
not_available OK .
not_available Fine .
not_available Just do me a favor , OK ?
not_available You got out .
not_available Stay out .
not_available Excuse me , excuse me , Mr .
not_available Fisher , sir , if I could just get a moment of your time .
not_available /
not_available What ?
not_available I'm from Kroehner Service International .
not_available I need to talk to you about the advantages of joining our family of death care facilities .
not_available I don't believe this .
not_available Sir , if you could just hear me out We're not selling .
not_available Now get the fuck out of here !
not_available We wouldn't change the name of the business , and , of course , we would retain you as a salaried manager .
not_available Look , I really want to hit somebody right now , and it might as well be you .
not_available I'll call you , when you've had some time to recover from your loss .
not_available You're really lucky , you know that ?
not_available You kidding ?
not_available It was over in a second .
not_available I didn't have to be afraid of it .
not_available I didn't even have to think about it .
not_available No more bullshit .
not_available No more responsibility
not_available No more having to care .
not_available /
not_available No more boredom .
not_available No more waiting to die .

not_available Well , here's my number , if you ever want to , I don't know , go out on a real date .
not_available You know , where you buy me dinner before I put out .
not_available Ah hah .
not_available Maybe I'm one of those women that meets a man who seems emotionally conflicted , no relationship skills , and I figure ,
not_available hey , it's for me .
not_available You know , I don't even live here
not_available , right ?
not_available I live in Seattle .
not_available See , that just makes you more attractive .
not_available /

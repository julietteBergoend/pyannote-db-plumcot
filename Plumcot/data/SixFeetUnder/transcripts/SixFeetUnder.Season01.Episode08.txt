kurt And I hate the way they treat older men .
not_available Tired old queen , fossil , troll .
not_available As if we're not gonna end up there ourselves one day .
not_available I'm getting my master's in social work with a concentration on services for seniors , so it's a pet peeve of mine .

not_available You'll just be a part of their assembly line .
not_available Yeah .
not_available We'll see .
federico_diaz A word of advice , guys .
not_available Don't turn your back on Gilardi .
not_available Well , so much for loyalty .
not_available Nate , he's given us five years .
not_available He doesn't owe us anything .
not_available Nobody owes us .

not_available Now it's your turn .
not_available You want me to apologize ?
not_available Yes .
not_available For trying to use Billy's meltdown and Connor's visit to push me away .
not_available For being impatient with my very valid emotional response to each one .
not_available And for always asking me to adjust my behavior and feelings but never being willing to do that yourself .
not_available Okay , that's fair .
not_available I apologize .
not_available Part of you wants me to bail .
not_available Yeah , you're probably right .
brenda_chenowith Why ?
brenda_chenowith Because we've already gone further than I have with anybody since Since a long time ago .

not_available Sorry .
not_available Well , do me a favor .
nate_fisher Promise me from here on out
not_available I am the only naked man in your bed and in your life .
not_available I'm serious , Bren .
not_available Promise me .
nate_fisher I promise .
not_available I love you and I want to be with you for the long haul .
not_available But there's a limit to the amount of shit I will put up with .
not_available Did you just make me a lifetime commitment right before the thinly veiled threat of abandonment ?
not_available Well , I don't remember using the word " lifetime .
brenda_chenowith "
not_available Oh , well , I won't hold you to it .
brenda_chenowith Sorry
not_available I'm so weird about intimacy .
not_available I guess spending your childhood being picked apart by behavioral psychologists will do that .
not_available Yeah , well , not being able to sleep at night because you know your basement's full of dead people takes its toll too .
not_available Sorry .
david_fisher Nate Fisher .
not_available Remember that chartered bus that overturned last night ?
not_available They were all locals .
not_available We're getting three .
not_available The first family will be here in an hour .

not_available Don't ask .
not_available So did Mom freak when you told her I got busted ?
not_available I didn't tell her .
not_available Okay , why ?
not_available I don't know , other stuff came up .
claire_fisher It seemed like a low priority .
not_available Are you going to ?
david_fisher Probably not .
not_available I'm sorry the Crossroads thing didn't work out like you had hoped .
not_available Actually , it was kind of amazing .
not_available I think I really learned something valuable .
not_available Everything I think I know is wrong .
not_available Hey , what happened to that guy Keith ?
not_available It just didn't work out .
not_available That's too bad .
not_available Life goes on .

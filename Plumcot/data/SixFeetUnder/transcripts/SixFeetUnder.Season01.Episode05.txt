father_jack Thanks .
not_available You know , your father was a deacon here , and we still haven't replaced him .

tracy_montrose_blair We're engaged .
tracy_montrose_blair Oh , well , good for you !
not_available Most men your age are so commitment phobic it's pathetic .
not_available Yes , men are pigs .
not_available Or they're gay .
david_fisher Well , I'm certainly glad to find out you're not gay .
not_available I have to go .
not_available My mother's waiting .
not_available She seems nice .
not_available She seems nuts .
not_available Hello !
nate_fisher Out here !
brenda_chenowith Hey .
not_available This is the life , huh ?
not_available Apparently .
not_available So how often do Mommy and Daddy go away ?
not_available Oh , constantly .
brenda_chenowith They're very important people .
not_available Very important places to go .
not_available Lucky for them , I have absolutely nowhere to go .
not_available How are you ?
not_available I'm good .
not_available It's chilly today .
not_available Aren't you cold ?
not_available Nope .
brenda_chenowith Jeez , it's like a hot tub in here .
not_available Mommy and Daddy keep it this hot all the time , even in summer .
not_available They're very wasteful .
not_available That's just wrong .
not_available Man , you
not_available areWhat ?
not_available You're unlike any woman I've ever met .
not_available Good .
not_available You scare me a little .
not_available Why ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available There's just so much
brenda_chenowith I don't know about you .
not_available Me ?
margaret_chenowith I am an open book .
margaret_chenowith I'm so glad you're bringing your friends home .
brenda_chenowith You know , you haven't done that in years .
not_available What are you doing here ?
not_available You said you'd be gone through the weekend .
not_available Yes , it's Sunday .
brenda_chenowith It's the end of the weekend .
brenda_chenowith Nate , these are my parents , Margaret and Bernard Chenowith .
not_available Margaret and Bernard , this is Nate Fisher , the man I am having sex with .
not_available Hello .
nate_fisher Brenda has told us absolutely nothing about you .
not_available Well , you know what ?
nate_fisher I'm not surprised .
not_available I'm not sure there's that much to tell .
not_available Oh , don't be so modest .
not_available Nate's studying for his funeral director's license .
not_available Well , Nate , you'll have to tell us all about that .
not_available Won't you stay for lunch ?
nate_fisher At least a drink or two ?
not_available I'd like to , but I really have to study .
not_available Well , then you'll have to join us for dinner some time .
not_available Uh that sounds great .
not_available Great .
gary_deitman OK , Mrs . Fisher , I've asked you here today
not_available so we could talk about your relationship with Claire .
not_available I told her it wasn't my idea .
not_available Uh , now , Claire feels that being the youngest child , perhaps , she might have missed out on a time when the family was happier .
not_available No .
not_available That's what you said .
not_available I told you .
not_available I don't think there was a time that this family was ever happy .
ruth_fisher That is not true .
not_available There was lots of happiness .
not_available When the boys were young .
ruth_fisher When you were young , Claire .
not_available You were a very happy little girl , and you know it .
not_available Just because I was too young to realize what freaks we were .
claire_fisher Why would you come into this man's office and tell him we were never happy ?
claire_fisher I don't know .
not_available Because I grew up in a house that was usually filled with total strangers who were crying all the time .
ruth_fisher Oh , boo hoo !
not_available I grew up in a two room apartment over a barber shop , and I spent my teenage years taking care of my grandmother after one , and then both , of her legs were amputated .
not_available Life's hard ! /
not_available Mrs .
not_available Fisher
not_available You had a roof over you head .
not_available You didn't go hungry .
not_available You see , she gets up on this cross , and then there's just no talking to her .
not_available You did not have to go begging for food on the streets of Calcutta .
not_available What ?
not_available Because I wasn't dropped in a dumpster somewhere , I'm not supposed to want things to be better ?
not_available This is good .
not_available This is good for you to talk like this .
not_available These are obviously things you need to say .
claire_fisher So what ?
not_available Are we just supposed to fight and get on each other's nerves ?
gary_deitman I prefer the not talking thing .
not_available I think you should try to have more of a dialogue .
gary_deitman Make time for it .
gary_deitman Schedule it .
not_available Remember , any relationship is work .
not_available OK ?
not_available Excellent session .
not_available That's it ?
not_available Now that's up to you , isn't it ?
not_available He does this for like five different schools .
not_available She should look spectacular .
david_fisher You know , that's the most important thing .
larry_wadd We'll make sure that she looks her best .
not_available She was the real deal , you know ?
larry_wadd She was a star .
not_available And I can assure you we will give her a funeral that befits the star that she was and always will be .
not_available You know who she was ?
not_available Absolutely , and I'm a big fan of hers .
not_available Hey , Rico .
federico_diaz Holy moley !
not_available Feel .
nate_fisher They're really hard .
nate_fisher Uh .
federico_diaz No , thanks .
not_available Like a rock .
not_available You see how they're all cockeyed ?
not_available They've got this low cut flimsy thing they want her in , and they said absolutely no bra .
not_available Shit .
not_available I don't know what the heck
federico_diaz I'm gonna do .
not_available Maybe I could like tape 'em together somehow .
not_available Do you know where this stuff goes ?
federico_diaz If I put it in the wrong place , David will bitch at me for a week .
david_fisher Top left , above the purple stuff .
not_available Well , boys , this might just be our highest profit margin funeral this year .
not_available She's rich , huh ?
not_available The guy who's paying for it is .
david_fisher Huh , she looks so familiar to me .
not_available She was an actress .
not_available Viveca St .
not_available John .
nate_fisher Oh my God , you're right !
not_available That's her ?
not_available Oh , fuck !
not_available And apparently she was quite talented .
not_available She was a porno star .
not_available What? ! ?
not_available David , she was huge like back in the mid to late 80s .
not_available Come on , you never saw any of her videos ?
nate_fisher No , Nate , I missed those .
not_available Oh , man !
nate_fisher This chick fucked a snake .
not_available This chick fucked like 30 guys at one time .
not_available I saw that !
not_available I saw that !
federico_diaz My cousin Ramone showed me when I was like 12 .
not_available On the diving board , OK ?
not_available They were like wrapped around the pool .
not_available Did you see the one where the guy's riding this motorcycle that she's strapped to , so he's fucking her while he's riding around in circles ?
david_fisher Oh , shit !
david_fisher Nate , can I speak to you outside for a minute ?
not_available Dammit , Nate !
not_available The woman on that table is just as deserving of dignity as anyone else we prepare , and Federico is an employee .
not_available It's up to you and me to set an example for him , alright ?
david_fisher Alright , I'm sorry .
not_available Show some respect .
david_fisher These are human lives we're dealing with here .
nate_fisher These are not organic blackberries or granola in bulk .
david_fisher I said I'm sorry .
not_available I don't want you to be sorry .
not_available I want you to remember that what we do here is serious .
not_available Because it really sucks for me always having to be the spoilsport .
not_available OK .
nate_fisher Thank you .
not_available Hello .
not_available Hey , Bernard Chenowith .
not_available Hi .
not_available Margaret and I were wondering if you would join us for dinner .
margaret_chenowith Tomorrow night .
not_available Tell him we're not gonna take no for an answer .
nate_fisher You hear that ?
not_available Well , actually , I have a lot of studying to do for this exam .
margaret_chenowith I'd really like toNate , we'd really love to be able to get a sense of who you are , and I'm sure you're curious about us as well , right ?
not_available Uh Good .
nate_fisher Shall we say seven ish ?
not_available Can I bring anything ?
not_available Hello ?
not_available Suck on that , you little fuck !
not_available Hi , there's this thing called knocking .
not_available It's like protected in the first amendment .
not_available I rented some videos .
not_available I thought you and I could watch them tonight .
ruth_fisher Remember when you were in middle school ?
not_available You and I used to go to the movies every Monday night .
claire_fisher Remember how much fun we had ?
not_available I remember seeing a lot of really bad movies .
not_available What'd you get ?
not_available Runaway Bride and The Nutty Professor .
not_available Cool .
not_available It'll be good for business , too .
not_available Dad was a deacon there , and it's a big congregation .
not_available People die , families don't know where to go , and the church sends them our way .
not_available They know you're gay ?
not_available I think Father Jack has a pretty good idea .
not_available You think he likes you ?
keith_charles Keith
not_available Does this mean that you're not going to be going to church with me anymore ?
not_available Well , if they make me a deacon , I'd have to go there all the time ,
not_available yeah .
not_available I'm sorry .
david_fisher I know .
keith_charles Sunday's sort of been our day .
not_available I think it's great .
keith_charles I really do .
not_available The things I love about you , it's the fact that your religion means so much to you .
not_available Besides , I think it could be kind of hot , you know ?
not_available Dating a man of the cloth .
david_fisher I need you to do something for me .
not_available What is it , my son ?
not_available You know the Gay Firemen and Police Officers Club
not_available I belong to ?
not_available Well , we're having a party in the Laguna this weekend .
not_available I want you to be my date .
not_available Your date ?
keith_charles Will I get a corsage ?
not_available I want you to start meeting some of my friends , David .
keith_charles I'd like that .
not_available Oh , forgive me , Father , for I am about to sin .
claire_fisher This is an entire movie about expelling gas .
not_available I think that's why people like it .
not_available I don't want to watch this .
ruth_fisher Good , because neither do I. Claire , look .
not_available I know you probably think I'm old and stupid .
not_available No , Mom , I don't .
not_available But I love you just as much as I ever did , and I'm worried about you , and I don't know how to help .
not_available I don't need help !
not_available Why is everyone acting like I'm in the Trenchcoat Mafia ?
not_available You stole a foot !
claire_fisher A human foot !
not_available OK , you wanna know why ?
not_available Because some guy who totally scammed me into having sex with him because I thought he actually cared about me he told the entire school that I sucked his toes , and then when I confronted him about it , he showed entirely no remorse , so when I saw Nate drop the foot on the floor , I just grabbed it , just to get back at that asshole , OK ?
claire_fisher It wasn't premeditated .
claire_fisher I'm not Jeffrey Dahmer .
not_available I don't get off on hacked up body parts .
not_available You're having sex? ! ?
claire_fisher Oh , Jesus .
not_available No , I'm sorry , I cannot have this conversation with you .
not_available And I'm really sorry , but I don't think we're ever gonna have one of these touchyfeely mother daughter relationships like you see on TV and the movies ,
not_available because , you know why ?
dr_bernard_chenowith They don't exist !
not_available Ah , here's our guest !
margaret_chenowith And he brought us a bottle of .
margaret_chenowith OK , a man who knows his wine .
not_available My , I'm liking you more and more , Nate .
not_available Well , I worked at a food co op in Seattle for a long time , learned a little bit .
margaret_chenowith A co op ?
margaret_chenowith So there's a little hippie in there , huh ?
not_available That makes sense .
not_available Brenda would find that attractive .
margaret_chenowith She likes to think of herself as being wildly countercultural , but I think she's actually just jealous that Bern and I really were hippies briefly .
not_available Now , can I offer you a drink ?
not_available Sure .
margaret_chenowith You have any beer ?
margaret_chenowith No .
nate_fisher We have vodka , scotch , bourbon
margaret_chenowith Uh , I'll have a little bourbon .
not_available Manly but not elitist .
not_available Just her type .
not_available Down , girl .
not_available So where is Brenda ?
not_available Brenda ?
not_available Oh , Brenda's not coming tonight .
margaret_chenowith Really ?
not_available Well , she felt , and I really have to agree with her , that we'd have a much better chance of getting to know each other if she weren't here .
not_available You know , she does tend to take center stage , so to speak .
nate_fisher Huh .
not_available I kind of wish somebody'd thought to tell me about this .
margaret_chenowith I'm sorry .
not_available I assumed she did .
not_available There you are .
not_available David was raised in this church .
father_jack He was christened and confirmed here .
father_jack He served as an altar boy , and he was president of the Youth Ministry in high school .
not_available How old are you , David ?
not_available I'm 31 .
david_fisher What do you do for a living ?
larry_wadd I'm a funeral director .
father_jack Ah .
not_available His father served as a deacon for over a decade .
not_available He just recently passed away .
david_fisher So , you see this as a sort of passing the torch ?
not_available No , sir , I see it as a chance to serve God .
not_available Well , I'm glad to hear you say that .
father_jack Because that's what it is .
not_available Being a deacon here is more than just having access to the church mailing list and passing out your business cards after Mass .
david_fisher Sir , I won't deny that I run a business providing service to people in times of need , but I would never exploit my relationship to the church for marketing purposes .
not_available Frankly , I would consider that to be a pretty grave sin .
father_jack No pun intended .
not_available St .
not_available Bartholomew is an old church , a conservative church , a church that doesn't need to have its boat rocked .
not_available Which is precisely why I feel that David is such a good candidate .
not_available How many men his age have values as strong as his ?
not_available I think he would be an excellent role model .
father_jack Are you married ?
not_available Uh , no , sir .
not_available I was engaged briefly .
david_fisher Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about yourself before I consider this ?
not_available No , sir .
not_available Is there anything specific about me
#unknown#SixFeetUnder.Season01.Episode05 you'd like to ask ?
not_available I'll let you know my decision in a few days .
not_available You impressed him .
not_available You think ?
not_available Yes .
not_available Oh , by the way , one of our parishioners recently lost her father to liver cancer Sharon Murdoch .
not_available I gave her your name .
not_available You may be getting a call .
not_available Thank you .
not_available Again , with the not knocking .
not_available Pack some things .
claire_fisher We're going to San Bernadino .
hannah What ?
not_available We're spending the night at my cousin ,
claire_fisher Hannah's .
not_available Mom , I'm doing homework .
claire_fisher Well , stop .
not_available I have school tomorrow .
not_available I'll write a note !
not_available You know , it's been such a long time since Brenda's wanted us to meet any of the men in her life .
gary_deitman What was that last one ?
not_available A chiropractor ?
not_available Oh , he was a rolfer .
not_available He was an idiot .
nate_fisher Well , to be perfectly honest , I'm not sure Brenda ever meant for us to meet .
margaret_chenowith I don't think she really expected you guys to come home that day .
nate_fisher Oh , Nate , where Brenda's concerned,there are no coincidences .
not_available You think she planned all this ?
not_available Of course .
not_available She is a master manipulator .
not_available I mean , I love her dearly , but you really oughtta
not_available know what you're getting into .
not_available Now , would you like another bourbon ?
not_available Uh
not_available No , thanks .
dr_bernard_chenowith Can I ask you guys something ?
not_available As long as it doesn't involve asking us for money .
not_available Uh , no , it doesn't .
not_available Does the name , " Nathaniel , " have any significance to you ?
not_available Well , sure .
not_available Nathaniel and Isabel .
not_available Brenda adored these books as a little girl .
not_available She could read by the time she was three .
margaret_chenowith What are they about ?
not_available Two orphans who had adventures .
not_available They ran away from an orphanage .
not_available There was a malevolent nurse who was always hunting them down , but they always managed to outsmart her .
nate_fisher Typical infantile wish fulfillment .
nate_fisher Hmm .
not_available I've never heard of them .
not_available They're British .
not_available Quite dark .
not_available People die in them all the time .
not_available When Brenda's brother was born , we expected serious displacement anxiety from her , but there was none .
m She would sit next to his crib , and read him these stories for hours .
not_available She was what then , Bern , 4 ? 5 at the most .
nate_fisher It's all in the book .
not_available This book ?
not_available You mean she didn't tell you about that either ?
not_available Ruthie , I am so glad you called .
not_available Ginnie and I would never allow ourselves this kind of food unless it were a really special occasion .
not_available We are definitely gonna have to do another spinning class this week .
ginnie Tomorrow morning .
not_available Who's teaching ?
ginnie Derrick .
not_available Oooh , I am so there !
ginnie Mom and I have the biggest crush onthis spinning director at the " Y . "
not_available He is hot , hot , hot .
not_available So , Claire , have you thought about college ?
not_available Yeah , I'd love to go to , like , NYU or Columbia , but I don't know if I'd ever get in ,
not_available so Well , there are some great schools in LA .
not_available Well , yeah ,
not_available but why would you wanna go to school in the same town you grew up in ?
not_available I go to Cal State , right here in San Berdo .
ruth_fisher Well , whatever rocks your boat .
not_available Claire
ginnie Hey , I love it .
not_available By living at home , I'm saving a ton of money for grad school .
ginnie I'm not stuck in some crappy dorm where everyone's smoking pot and playing loud music all the time .
not_available And I don't have to call campus police every time I wanna walk home from the library
ginnie so I don't get raped .
not_available And I like to stay close to my mom .
not_available She probably just stays
ginnie so I get to do her laundry .
not_available Oh , that's not true !
not_available I love my mom , and I'm not ashamed of it .
not_available Thank you , honey , and I love you too .
not_available OK , anybody want more ?
nate_fisher So how was it ?
nate_fisher Oh , it was quite informative .
nate_fisher I know what " Nathaniel " means now
nate_fisher , I know you have an IQ of 185
brenda_chenowith , I know you had a book written about you .
not_available Here , I signed it for you .
not_available Why didn't you just tell me about this ?
brenda_chenowith People always change towards me after they read it .
not_available I was just trying to make the fun part last .
not_available Oh , God .
not_available So you're kind of scarily brilliant .
not_available I can handle that .
not_available What I can't handle is the way you keep mindfucking me for your own personal entertainment , and it's really starting to piss me off .
brenda_chenowith Well , I'm sorry
nate_fisher I'm not some well behaved little nothing that never challenges you , but if that's what you're looking for , you might as well just leave right now .
not_available So , what , are you trying to drive me away ?
brenda_chenowith Oh , yeah , I'm trying to drive you away , Nate .
brenda_chenowith It was my mother's idea that I not be there , which is fine by me .
not_available I don't really enjoy their company .
not_available She said it was your idea .
brenda_chenowith Yeah , she would .
not_available She probably believes it .
not_available She's out of her fucking mind !
not_available You could have warned me what I was walking into .
not_available You wouldn't have gone .
brenda_chenowith I just wanted to get it all out of the way .
not_available Them .
not_available The Book .
not_available Everything .
not_available Yeah , well , I felt like a fuckin' lab rat over there .
not_available Yeah , that's what they do !
not_available I'm 6 years old .
brenda_chenowith I score through the roof on some standardized , culturally biased test , and it all becomes about them .
not_available They hand me over to strangers , experts , a bunch of academic fucks who scrutinize everything I did or said or thought even .
not_available It is a fucking law of physics that the very act of observation changes that which is being observed .
not_available And now you're gonna read that book and think that you know me .
not_available Well , you know what ?
nate_fisher You don't .
not_available Yeah , because you won't let me .
brenda_chenowith OK .
brenda_chenowith Fine .
not_available What do you wanna know ?
not_available Ask me anything .
not_available Did you burn down that house that we made love in ?
not_available You think I burned down the house ?
brenda_chenowith Really ?
not_available That is so weird !
not_available Well , what am I supposed to think ?
not_available You put my brother and me in the bus that killed our father , you get weird phone calls from screaming people that you won't explain , and now , oh , you want to make me feel stupid for being suspicious .
not_available Well , give me a fuckin' reason not to be !
not_available I just wanna know what this is .
not_available Why you Am I just another step along your way ?
not_available OK , look .
not_available We obviously have an intense sexual connection , and , yes , I would like for there to be something more than that , but that can't ever happen until you trust me , which , apparently , you don't .
nate_fisher Should I trust you ?
not_available Yes .
not_available Come here .
ginnie R RA RAK RAK E. Woo !
not_available Triple letter score for " K . "
not_available Good one , Mom !

not_available Use it in a sentence . "
not_available He deftly juggled his responsibilities .

not_available So how are you both doing ?
not_available You know , with Nathaniel's passing ?
not_available Better every day .
hannah Yeah , you know , shit happens .
not_available You know , it's such an awful thing losing someone you love .
not_available In terms of stress , it's right up there with moving and getting fired .
hannah Mm hmm .
not_available I know when Ed and I split up , I was just devastated .
hannah I didn't even want to get out of bed .
hannah I just wanted to curl up and die .
not_available And all I can say is thank God for my precious daughter .
not_available Well , I just wouldn't let her mope .
not_available Just wouldn't let her .
hannah Dragged her ass , pardon my French , out of bed and took her to spinning class with me .
not_available And I hated her for it at the time , but it really got me back on track .
not_available You know , endorphins really are nature's anti depressants .
hannah Mm hmm .
ruth_fisher Life goes on .
not_available It doesn't go on by itself .
not_available Sometimes you just gotta kick it in the butt .
not_available But Ed didn't die .
not_available He's still alive .
not_available You can still see him .
ruth_fisher When Ginnie gets married , you'll both be there .
not_available When she has children , they'll be able to know him .
hannah He's not gone forever .
ginnie Oh , well sure , but in terms of the impact it had on both of our lives , it's similar .
ginnie I had the greatest idea !
not_available You guys are coming to spinning class with us tomorrow morning , bright and early .
ginnie No offense , but I'd rather drive a rusty railroad spike through my skull .
not_available Oh , just try it once .
claire_fisher You might be surprised how it changes the way that you feel .
not_available I feel fine .
hannah You know what , Ginnie ?
not_available That is an absolutely inspired idea !
jean_louise_mcarthur OK , ladies , let's get to bed , because if your butt isn't on that bike by 6 AM , Derrick doesn't let us in .
not_available So these tits do nothin' for ya , huh ?
not_available Well , I can appreciate that they are beautiful .
not_available In their own completely artificial way .
not_available Men loved them .
jean_louise_mcarthur Well , real men .
not_available Do you think God cares that you're gay ?
jean_louise_mcarthur Do you think God cares that you fucked 30 guys at once ?
not_available Oh , so you equate being a fag with being a whore !
not_available No .
not_available One's OK
david_fisher but one isn't ?
not_available I think God appreciates it when there's love involved .
jean_louise_mcarthur Oh , honey , I loved every man I ever fucked while I was fuckin'
not_available him

ruth_fisher Watching you .
not_available Claire , wake up !

not_available I'm just a little surprised , that's all .
david_fisher I'm too nervous to eat .
not_available I'll just drink coffee until I start twitching and sweating .
not_available Why does being a deacon mean so much to you now ?
david_fisher It wasn't even a consideration for you a week ago .
keith_charles Look , I know you think it's naive , but I see it as a chance to make a difference , make the world just a little more tolerant .
not_available David , we have our own church in West Hollywood , which means the other churches and dioceses don't have to tolerate us .
not_available Frankly , I resent the notion that we need to be tolerated .
not_available So what ?
not_available We should just allow ourselves to be ghettoized ?
not_available Why do you embrace an organization that doesn't embrace you ?
not_available The church embraces everyone .
not_available Oh , yeah , right .
keith_charles Hate the sin , love the sinner ?
not_available The operative word being " hate . "
david_fisher What is it with you ?
not_available The other night you said you liked the idea .
brenda_chenowith I had a chance to think .
david_fisher Isn't that your brother ?
not_available Hey , can we just have breakfast without feeling like I'm George Will
keith_charles and you're Cokie Roberts with PMS ?
not_available You'd probably like George Will .
not_available Dave .
not_available Uh , hi .
david_fisher Hey .
keith_charles Keith , you remember my brother , Nate , don't you ?
not_available Yeah , how's it going ?
not_available Hey .

brenda_chenowith I think David is lucky .
not_available Did you get a look at that guy ?
ruth_fisher Claire ?
not_available I had an affair .
ruth_fisher For the last two years , I was seeing someone .
not_available Your father never knew about it , at least I hope he didn't .
not_available And I called it off after he died .
not_available It's not something I'm proud of .
not_available Why are you telling me this ?
not_available Because it's the truth , and whatever relationship you
not_available and I have
not_available , I want it to be honest , even if you hate me .
not_available Mom , I don't hate you .
not_available I remember going to the movies on Monday nights .
claire_fisher But I'm 17 years old now , and I have my own life , and there's things I have to figure out on my own,and
not_available that's , like , normal .
not_available And I know stealing a foot is weird , but , hello , living in a house where a foot is available to be stolen is weird .
not_available I've gotta get to school .
not_available Did you see his face ?
david_fisher Oh , man , I know I shouldn't be laughing,but he just looked so stupefied !
not_available The way he was all , " Great , great .
keith_charles I'm hip , I'm cool .
keith_charles " I'm proud of you , man .
not_available So , listen , this thing we're doing Saturday night .
keith_charles I got us a room at the Surfin' Center .
not_available You ever been there ?
not_available No .
keith_charles Oh , man , it's gonna be great !
not_available It's got a fireplace overlooking the ocean .
not_available Keith , I don't think I can make it after all .
not_available I shouldn't miss church , not while they're considering me for deaconship .
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available Fine .
david_fisher We'll come back Saturday night .
keith_charles That'll work .
david_fisher I can go to church with you on Sunday .
not_available It's not a good idea .
not_available This hasn't been a good idea from the beginning , has it ?
keith_charles Fine .
not_available Why don't we cut our losses and call it quits right now ?
keith_charles What?Look
not_available , as long as you feel the need to keep our relationship a secret David , you're ashamed of it , man .
not_available I'm not having any of that .
david_fisher Not anymore .
keith_charles I just came out to my brother !
david_fisher One step forward , now you wanna take a giant leap backwards right into the arms of the enemy !
not_available So now I'm a Nazi collaborator ?
not_available You know , a lot of African Americans might saythe same thing about you being a member of the LAPD .
not_available You're a fucking coward !
nate_fisher Keith , please dont
not_available It works !
not_available I must have left the stereo on again .
nate_fisher So , you are not too freaked out ?
nate_fisher A little , maybe .
not_available It certainly makes David more interesting .
not_available No , I mean about me giving you a key to my apartment .
not_available Oh , come on , what do you think I am ?
not_available Some sort of aging Peter Pan who's gonna disappear at the first sign of something a little more permanent ?
not_available Well , yeah .
not_available Yeah , well , you're one to talk .
not_available You wouldn't even allow me to refer to you as my girlfriend .
not_available Don't mind me .
not_available I thought we agreed that you would call before you came over .
not_available I did .
not_available The hot water's out at my building .
not_available I needed to take a shower .
billy_chenowith Oh , don't be mad at me .
not_available You know , I hate it when you're mad at me .
not_available Satisfied ?
not_available I am going to make a cup of tea .
not_available Hey , I'll take one of those .

not_available Well , I guess I'd better go put some clothes on .
not_available How'd you get her breasts synchronized ?
not_available By some industrial epoxy ?
nate_fisher Would you ask Colonel Sanders for his secret recipe ?
not_available Oh , come on , who am I gonna tell ?
not_available I stuck a can of cat food under each one .
not_available My sisterin law did a cat food commercial .
not_available I've got like ten cases .
not_available Hey , I'm Larry Wadd .
not_available You know , I met Viveca St .
not_available John before she even did her first video .
not_available She was , uh , she was the fluffer on the set of " Dirty Larry III .
larry_wadd "
not_available She was , uh , friendly , she was eager , and
not_available I could honestly say I never received a better blowjob in my life .
not_available Nobody was even filming it !
porn_starlet When I first met Viveca , I met her on " Deep Diving . "
porn_starlet Thank you .
not_available And I had never gone down on a girl before ,
porn_starlet so , naturally , I was nervous , but Viveca was so warm and relaxed about it .
not_available She really put me at ease .
porn_starlet Well , her and the two Zanex she gave me .
porn_starlet And when I first had to do a double penetration , I was like a total wreck .
porn_starlet But Viveca came through like , you know , like such the pro
not_available she is
ruth_fisher I mean was .
not_available Nate , what the hell is going on in there ?
not_available Uh Funeral .
ruth_fisher For whom ?
nate_fisher Prostitute ?

nate_fisher Mom , we're gonna clear like 8 grand from this .
not_available We can finally pay for that air conditioning work .
not_available I'm just glad your sister is at school .
claire_fisher It was awful .
not_available They're like best friends .
not_available And they're both like cheerleaders , this totally plastic way of life .
not_available Like spinning class solves everything .
not_available And they're both like hot for the same guy .
claire_fisher It was creepy .
not_available My mom's My mom's just so fucking sad .
not_available I wish I could help her .
david_fisher So help her .
david_fisher Now , Mrs . Murdoch , some people prefer the solemnity of a church , and St .
david_fisher Bartholomew is a beautiful setting .
not_available Here , however , one is more free to customize the service .
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt , but I just had to tell somebody
not_available Viveca looked so great .
not_available Her tits have never looked better .
david_fisher She was like a sister to me .
porn_starlet I'm so glad that you're pleased .

not_available OK .
david_fisher I think we'll have Dad's service at the church .
not_available Fine .
larry_wadd I'm not a religious man , but I do believe in God .
larry_wadd If I were to make a list of the things I thank God for the most , fucking Viv would be at the top of the list .
not_available She was a goddamned force of nature .
larry_wadd And I loved her .
not_available And I know God loved her , too , and I know that he knew just what he was doing , and how much joy she would bring to the world .

brenda_chenowith All that pageantry .

not_available It's like a Fellini movie .
not_available Well , it was kinda cool being with you here , in front of God and everybody .
not_available You don't really believe in God , do you ?
not_available Well , yeah .
nate_fisher I mean , I don't believe in some bearded old white man up on a cloud .
not_available But I believe in something .
not_available Some sort of undefinable creative force .
not_available I think it's just all totally random .
not_available Really ?
brenda_chenowith Yeah .
not_available We live , we die .
not_available Ultimately , nothing means anything .
not_available How can you live like that ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available Sometimes I wake up
not_available so fuckin'
not_available empty
not_available , I wish I'd never been born , but what choice do I have ?

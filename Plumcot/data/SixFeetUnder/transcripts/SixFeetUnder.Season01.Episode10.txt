
not_available So I say to this guy, "I can't do anything unless you give me an order number.
not_available And I don't appreciate your taking that tone of voice with me." He says he doesn't have an order number.
not_available And I say, "Well, you should always write down the order number." Then he gets all pissy.
not_available Says he wants to speak to the person he ordered the Astoria floor lamp from.
not_available And I say, "Well, do you remember his or her" Right, you know? "name?" And he says, "Of course not." And I say, "Then I'm sorry, I can't help you." He says this isn't the first time he had a problem ordering from us.
not_available Last Christmas he bought a CD holder, and it arrived all broken.
not_available When we told him, "Send it back" he couldn't because he'd thrown away the box it came in.
not_available So I say I say, "Boo
not_available hoo, mister.
not_available Ain't you got it bad." And he says, "I wanna talk to your supervisor." And I say, "Of course you can talk to him but unfortunately, his hours are only 8:30" So now the wife's in jail, according to the cousin who arranged the funeral.
not_available I bet he was abusing her.
not_available Maybe he had some sick sexual thing he made her do.
not_available Please, stop.
not_available And you're wrong.
not_available All she told the police was that he was boring.
not_available That's it? That's all she said? 
not_available The sick part is, I understand it.
not_available I do too.
not_available Sometimes I'm boring.
not_available I am too.
not_available I should be at both intakes with you this morning but you'll have to do the casket meeting because I'm really backed up down here.
not_available David, maybe we need to think about finding a replacement for Rico.
not_available Why? We're doing just fine without him.
not_available It's saving money, thank you very much.
not_available Is there something you'd like to say about my work? Look, you do a great job when it comes to people who had peaceful farewells.
not_available But the big reconstructions, you're out of your league.
not_available I see, so those who can't do, criticize? We've got a body that's a page
not_available one rewrite.
not_available We got two more coming in from that nightclub fire in Valencia.
not_available How bad was that fire? 
not_available Well, this is where they ended up.
not_available Maybe the families want Open caskets.
not_available They already put in the requests.
not_available I'll put an ad in the paper today.
not_available It's taken care of.
not_available I've scheduled some interviews for this afternoon.
not_available As you can see from my r'esum'e, I've had the good fortune to study under a variety of gifted restorative artists.
not_available Oh, you worked over at Hope Valley.
not_available I've known P.T.
not_available For years.
not_available Look, that lawsuit about the unembalmed arm was not my fault.
not_available I took the fall for some bitch that was supposed to cover me for leaving early.
not_available Sometimes I wake up with a feeling of panic like my heart's gonna beat right out of my chest.
not_available You know what I'm talking about.
not_available But after I spend a few extra hours in bed and do my chanting, the dark time usually passes.
not_available I know it sounds funny, but the first time I embalmed someone it felt like I was coming home.
not_available I just knew that this is what I was meant to do.
not_available That doesn't sound funny at all.
not_available There's something very intimate about it.
not_available I'm the last person on earth who gets to know these people.
not_available Anyway, I guess I take what I do very seriously.
not_available Well, I have no further questions.
not_available Me neither.
not_available Thanks for coming in, Angela.
not_available We'll be in touch.
not_available Great.
not_available It was very nice to meet you.
not_available It was nice to meet you.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll wait an hour before I call her.
not_available We don't wanna look desperate.
not_available Just find out if she can start tomorrow.
not_available David, David! David! Why are you standing there like that? I was thinking.
not_available Isn't a person allowed to think? You're gonna wish you'd gotten high with me.
not_available I told you, I'm never getting high again.
not_available Oh, doesn't Billy look great? So handsome and confident.
not_available Yo, Billy! Would you excuse me for one moment? Thanks for coming.
not_available I really appreciate it.
not_available Thank God you're here.
not_available My mouth is really dry, and is my breath bad? No, it's fine.
not_available So truth.
not_available Is this show good, or is it just pretentious bullshit? There're so many people, it's hard to see the pictures.
not_available This is Billy's best work ever, very disturbing.
not_available Really? 
not_available I'm so proud of you, God! Why is my mother here? Oh, God.
not_available I invited her as part of my ongoing campaign to get her to like me.
not_available I didn't think she'd actually turn up.
not_available You know that some stranger just rubbed my ass? Isn't this fabulous? Oh, Billy, darling.
not_available Thanks, Mom.
not_available You can't keep him to yourself all the time.
not_available Okay, no offense, but your family is fucked up beyond comprehension.
not_available She's completely tanked.
not_available I brought someone.
not_available I hope that's okay.
not_available Hey, Nikolai.
not_available Hello, Nate, how are you? 
not_available This is Brenda.
not_available Good evening.
not_available Hello, dear.
not_available It's good to see you, Mrs.
not_available Fisher.
not_available Where's Hiram? 
not_available He's visiting his son in Portland.
not_available I'm serious, darling, this new stuff is really visceral.
not_available Not at all left
not_available brained like your father.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, so where is Dad? Oh, honey, Bern sends his regrets.
not_available He's just heartsick.
not_available Unfortunately, he's treating one of his patients who's undergoing a complete psychotic break at the moment.
not_available That always seems to happen whenever there's something important in my life.
not_available I guess that's just typical Bernard I'm sorry, Bernard Chenowith behavior.
not_available Pretentious dick.
not_available Now, you just hush.
not_available I thought this would be paintings.
not_available I could take photographs.
not_available That doesn't mean they'd be any good.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Fisher, I've never seen you having this much fun.
not_available Oh, no, no, no, it's great.
not_available I am having fun just watching you.
not_available Hey, Mr.
not_available Seattle co
not_available op hippie boy.
not_available Oh, Margaret Chenowith.
not_available Who are you? 
not_available Ruth Fisher.
not_available Nate's mother.
not_available That explains why you're looking at me like I just took a giant dump on your lawn.
not_available If I knew you were putting on a show tonight I would've bought tickets for all my friends.
not_available Goody, there's Dr.
not_available Feinberg.
not_available Hi.
not_available What is he doing here? I invited him.
not_available Gareth Feinberg, the guy who wrote the book? Yeah, he wrote Charlottefucking
not_available Light and Dark, He's a fucking evil dead fish of a fucking Nazi fuck.
not_available Darling, try not to act so adolescent.
not_available It only makes you look bad.
not_available As opposed to being drunk and slobbering all over my boyfriend who, by the way, is completely not interested.
not_available Isn't this fun? Billy, Billy, Billy.
not_available It's quite powerful stuff.
not_available It's It's potent.
not_available That's a word Dr.
not_available Feinberg likes to use a lot.
not_available Brenda, I see a lot of you in these photographs.
not_available Hello, Gareth.
not_available Margaret.
not_available Does this have a theme? I know you like your things to have a theme.
not_available Mother, nothing is more tedious than when you look for meaning in my work.
not_available I don't need your fucking approval.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Isn't that beautiful? 
not_available Yeah, it is.
not_available He's good.
not_available Yeah, he is really good.
not_available I only wish he'd believe that.
not_available This one's got real attitude.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available The light's spectacular.
not_available Brenda, that is a picture of me urinating on a wall.
not_available I realize that.
not_available Hey, what do you think? So now you're stalking me? No, I just saw you one day when I was taking pictures so I followed you.
not_available You were just out taking pictures? You live in Venice! There's no reason for you to be in my neighborhood.
not_available You think the world revolves around you.
not_available Bren, would you tell him, please, this isn't about him? It's what Billy does.
not_available He takes pictures of people when they're off guard.
not_available He's got a talent.
not_available It's art.
not_available No, it's fucked! Thanks a lot.
not_available Look.
not_available That's your son pissing against a wall.
not_available So I should let him humiliate me whenever he wants? Oh, God, Nate, don't make this about you.
not_available Why the fuck not? This is about me.
not_available You make enough stuff all about you.
not_available So what? There's a picture of you pissing on a wall.
not_available Who got hurt? Who died? You don't think I have a right to not be spied upon? You're talking to someone who was spied on her whole life.
not_available God, Billy is severely fucked up, Bren.
not_available I don't like being stalked by a psycho.
not_available Billy is not psychotic.
not_available He has a disease.
not_available He's fine when he takes his meds.
not_available Yeah, well, when the fuck is that? Look, has he ever done anything weird? Yeah, he's bipolar.
not_available His whole life he's been weird.
not_available Has he ever done anything dangerous? Oh, God.
not_available Nate, no.
not_available The only person Billy would ever be a threat to is himself.
not_available Has he ever tried to? 
not_available Yes.
not_available When I was 18.
not_available I went to Europe for three months.
not_available It was this big reward for me winning a scholarship to Yale.
not_available When I got back to L.A., my mother was at the airport.
not_available She told me that Billy had committed suicide.
not_available My whole life just collapsed in on itself in that moment.
not_available Of course, she meant to say that Billy had tried to commit suicide.
not_available She was drunk, or else it was a Freudian slip.
not_available You never went to Yale.
not_available Billy was in a hospital in Pasadena.
not_available I took some classes at UCLA in the spring.
not_available Then in the fall, he was diagnosed manic
not_available depressive which kicks in in adolescence so it probably had nothing to do with me getting the scholarship.
not_available I can't believe they pressured you into sacrificing your life for your brother.
not_available Nobody pressured me.
not_available I wanted to stay.
not_available Morning.
not_available Morning.
not_available Pee on any walls lately? Shut up.
not_available So, Mom, what's with you and Nikolai? I don't know what you're talking about.
not_available And Dave, what'd you do last night? Nothing.
not_available Saturday night, what happened to that? Person you're seeing? That person is no longer in the picture.
not_available Sorry to hear it.
not_available What about you? You dating anybody? 
not_available No.
not_available If you are, you don't need to hide him from us like we're lepers.
not_available I'm not dating anyone.
not_available I've just been hanging out a lot with somebody.
not_available Who is this person? Nobody.
not_available David, I'm ready to go to church.
not_available Thanks, guys.
not_available Hey, Joey, the kid's ready, 
not_available So am I, This is the most terrifying shower scene since Psycho.
not_available That football game used to make this obnoxious noise when you scored a touchdown.
not_available Do you wanna show me how to play it? No.
not_available You know, there's this There's this little kid next door and the only toy he's got is this stupid Mousetrap game from when his mom was a kid.
not_available Maybe, you know, he'd want some of these.
not_available It's a beautiful day.
not_available Why would you waste your Sunday in here watching TV? What are you doing? I thought that Tony Rechner next door might want some of these.
not_available Just keep your hands off them.
not_available She doesn't even look me in the eyes anymore.
not_available Come on, I wanna show you something funny.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available We're going on a field trip? This is like the first day of school.
not_available I am so excited.
not_available Oh, and I just wanna apologize in advance because I had calamari last night for dinner.
not_available What do you mean? 
not_available Let's just say this is one time where the strong smell of formaldehyde really comes in handy.
not_available So then I said, "I don't care if you have a low sperm count.
not_available I mean, I'll just shove a turkey baster up there if I have to." I mean, I wanna have a child before I turn 40.
not_available That's fair, right? Hello, everyone.
not_available Hi.
not_available How was church? Nate told me you're a deacon.
not_available That's adorable.
not_available I see you've made yourself at home.
not_available Angela doesn't like to feel constrained.
not_available Well, you know, my glands go double
not_available time.
not_available I find if I wear too much while I work, I get all pitted.
not_available Angela, we're sort of used to a more professional appearance around here.
not_available Give me a break, David, they're just nipples.
not_available I mean, we've all seen them.
not_available We've all touched them.
not_available We've all sucked on them.
not_available It's not like this guy will be lying in the casket and people will be saying, "Oh, my God, the embalmer's nipples were hard." They'll be saying, "How did they put his face back together after he went through the goddamn windshield?" I told Father Jack I'd help with the food distribution downtown.
not_available I just wanted to make sure that your first day was going okay.
not_available Well, thanks.
not_available I'm all gassy, but that's not your fault.
not_available Angela had calamari last night.
not_available Boy, he's a barrel of laughs.
not_available It's hard when a new person comes into a situation, It throws everything off balance.
not_available Bren, I am not threatened by your boyfriend.
not_available Oh, yeah? Your behavior consistently communicates otherwise.
not_available You want the picture out of the show, fine.
not_available But don't spout psychobabble at me like fucking Margaret and Bernard.
not_available You're, like, becoming them.
not_available Fuck you! You know what you did was wrong.
not_available That's why you didn't show it to me.
not_available Why are you making it such a big deal? 
not_available Because I love him! You're fucking with my life, Billy, and it's not fair.
not_available You have to stop.
not_available Or what? Goddamn it, Billy, what is it with you? You like fucking with my brain like Feinberg? 
not_available Thank you.
not_available You're welcome.
not_available Can I get you anything else? I can always use a good blowjob.
not_available Hey, do I get my fucking lunch or not? 
not_available I'm going to get a drink of water.
not_available Yeah, sure.
not_available Melinda Daner, Mark Whitman Darryl Heinz, Keith Charles.
not_available Okay, well, just tell them we'll meet them at the usual corner on Tuesday.
not_available Okay.
not_available Hi, Tracy.
not_available Oh, hi, David.
not_available How have you been? 
not_available Fine.
not_available I love your new hair.
not_available What are you working on? St.
not_available Stephen's is sending over some volunteers to help out next week.
not_available Someone told me that you used to go to St.
not_available Stephen's.
not_available Not that I've been asking around about you.
not_available It just came up naturally.
not_available So did you? Go there, I mean.
not_available Yeah, just for a few months last year.
not_available They're a very progressive church.
not_available Yes, they are.
not_available The guy who took these is a total psycho.
not_available It's good.
not_available Well, we should probably get going if we wanna see that movie.
not_available I should probably get home and check on my mom.
not_available I'm sure she's doing fine.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available It's not like I was dying to see a movie.
not_available That's not what I'm talking about.
not_available I'm sorry about what happened between us.
not_available I never meant for those assholes to write shit on your car.
not_available I shouldn't have told Andy about us.
not_available I was just being stupid.
not_available That was me being really, really, really stupid and I'm sorry.
not_available Well, thank you.
not_available Look, I don't wanna make a big deal out of this.
not_available All I'm saying is, I sat around last week in that stupid getup you wanted me to wear and had to say all this, you know, "Daddy this" and "Daddy that" bullshit.
not_available When I tell you I keep reading articles about having this one
not_available hour orgasm well, the least you could do is try to help me have one.
not_available I'm sorry men can't have it.
not_available Since you guys get everything else on the planet it seems like a fair tradeoff.
not_available Fine.
not_available Goodbye.
not_available You know, Angela, my brother likes a certain decorum when you're working with someone's loved one.
not_available Yeah? Well, the personal calls are probably a little uncool.
not_available Oh, right, got it.
not_available I won't do it when he's around.
not_available Hello.
not_available Hey.
not_available Really? Why don't you want me to come over? Damn it, Brenda, you always do this.
not_available You're shutting me out.
not_available Look, the pissing thing is no longer an issue, I swear.
not_available Look, maybe you'd feel better if I came over.
not_available All right, fine, whatever.
not_available Fine.
not_available Girlfriend trouble? 
not_available Not really trouble.
not_available Tell me what the fight was about, and I'll tell you what to say to fix it.
not_available I mean, trust me, this is my thing.
not_available We didn't have a fight.
not_available She just pulls away from me at the weirdest times.
not_available Well, maybe she senses that you're pulling away so she just does it first.
not_available Maybe you should mind your own business.
not_available Shoot.
not_available I guess this means I can't ask about the pissing? Because I had an ex who wanted to pee on me, and I wasn't grossed out.
not_available I mean, I just thought it was kind of silly.
not_available But that's me.
not_available Thank you for taking me to the art gallery last night.
not_available I thought you hated those pictures.
not_available No, no, it's just that I don't like them, that's all.
not_available But it was nice to be spending time with you.
not_available I mean, outside of working together.
not_available Would you like to go to dinner sometime? Is that like a date? 
not_available Of course not.
not_available Good, I pick you up tomorrow night, 8:00.
not_available I don't wanna go, okay? Just stop asking me.
not_available Okay, fine.
not_available I was only inviting you to be nice.
not_available Nobody even wants you there because you've been acting so weird lately.
not_available Gabe? 
not_available We have to be someplace.
not_available Get lost, Morticia.
not_available Shut up, peanut
not_available testicle.
not_available Fuck off, the both of you.
not_available What's his problem? Nothing.
not_available He wants me to go to this party tomorrow.
not_available I'm just not in the mood.
not_available We can do something if you want.
not_available Actually, I gotta go to Barstow tomorrow and spend the night at my dad's.
not_available I gotta ask him for money for my mom.
not_available Not that he's gonna give it to me, but Well, do you want company? Claire, you don't have to keep taking care of me.
not_available I'm not.
not_available I just like hanging out.
not_available We could just go for the drive.
not_available Then you go see your dad and I'll stay in some, like, creepy motel and read a Stephen King book.
not_available Okay.
not_available Meet me after fifth period tomorrow by the gym.
not_available Oh, this is just what I need today.
not_available I see this is payback time for my missing your opening.
not_available Just shut up! Both of you, for once, just shut your fucking mouths.
not_available All that comes out of you is garbage, garbage, garbage! Okay.
not_available Good, we have a dialogue.
not_available Where did you get this? 
not_available From his office.
not_available It's all the data Feinberg has on Brenda.
not_available It's all destroyed.
not_available He can go to where he came from before he fucked her up.
not_available You're off the hook.
not_available Obviously, this has nothing to do with you missing his show.
not_available Don't fucking talk about me like I'm not here! Even though I'm not and never have been.
not_available Son, what's wrong? Just tell us.
not_available There's nothing wrong with me.
not_available I didn't sell my daughter to some smug, starfucking psychiatrist so he could pick her apart like a goddamn cadaver and turn her into shit and garbage just like everything you touch! Billy, sweetheart 
not_available You bitch! You're the fucking nurse.
not_available You wanna tie us up, lock us in a room, leave us to die.
not_available Well, you're the one that should die, you and him! You don't get to touch the children.
not_available I refuse to be an audience for this.
not_available Oh, boy.
not_available You can juice her, but you better let me take care of that skin.
not_available This guy has a really sinewy neck.
not_available Sinewy.
not_available I love saying that word, don't you? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available I went out with this guy once he had a really sinewy neck.
not_available He was a total animal in bed.
not_available I mean, the things he could do with his tongue.
not_available He thought he was God's gift to women.
not_available I guess in that one respect he was.
not_available So do you like sinewy necks, David? 
not_available I never really thought about it.
not_available Hey, I'm just trying to figure out your type.
not_available Believe me, I can tell you're single.
not_available And I know about a million people I can set you up with.
not_available So, what kind of guys do you like? What makes you think that I like men? Oh, please, let's not play that game.
not_available I think we should fire her.
not_available I'm thinking the same thing.
not_available Has she made a lot of mistakes? 
not_available No.
not_available She's a little hard to take.
not_available She's a lot hard to take.
not_available Sometimes people are hard to take but only because the first side they present is annoying or aggressive because they're nervous.
not_available After you spend some time with them you realize maybe there's another side to them that's worth knowing.
not_available Or not.
not_available I have no idea what I'm talking about.
not_available Sorry I'm late.
not_available By the way, I won't be here for dinner tomorrow, so everyone's on their own.
not_available Actually, I'm going to be volunteering with the food distribution.
not_available Well, that leaves you and me, Claire.
not_available You wanna go to the Apple Pan? Can't.
not_available I have to do this astronomy overnight thing at the observatory for school.
not_available I didn't hear about this.
not_available I told you.
not_available You probably weren't listening.
not_available That's the type of thing I would listen to.
not_available David and Nate did it when they went to Bonaventure.
not_available David, you did this? 
not_available Yeah, I had to.
not_available You too, Nate? Back then we thought Pluto was a planet.
not_available When did Pluto stop being a planet? 
not_available A few months ago.
not_available Well, I suppose it's okay for you to go.
not_available Luckily, Gareth isn't going to press charges.
not_available But I did promise him that steps would be taken to remedy the situation.
not_available I wish I'd been there to see the look on Feinberg's face.
not_available I'm sure he started with his whole blinking thing.
not_available Brenda, we have a serious problem.
not_available Okay, I'll talk to Billy's doctor, see if he needs to be on different medication.
not_available We were thinking of something a little more involved.
not_available Your mother and I feel that he needs to go away for intensive therapy.
not_available There's a very good facility in Colorado.
not_available You wanna put Billy in an institution? Oh, please, let's not turn this into a 1950s B
not_available movie.
not_available This place is run by excellent psychiatric specialists who may have some creative solution to help Billy.
not_available You wanna give him shock treatment.
not_available Darling, really, this dramatic streak, aren't you a little old for it? And just for the record, electroconvulsive therapy's had a real resurgence in the last 10 years with very impressive results.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available We think it's best.
not_available It certainly makes your lives easier.
not_available God forbid Billy should embarrass you in front of your stupid celebrity friends.
not_available Unfortunately, he's an adult which means you can't have him committed unless he does something dangerous.
not_available Darling? We were thinking if you talked to him, explained how it would help him Fuck you both.
not_available You're out of your minds.
not_available Hi, I'm Angela.
not_available You must be Ruth.
not_available Yes.
not_available I spilled some beet salad on someone's wig so David said I should eat up here.
not_available I got the stains out.
not_available Everyone in my family gets cancer, so I know tons about taking care of wigs.
not_available Is that yours? The hair, I mean.
not_available As far as I know.
not_available It's beautiful.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I don't wanna be one of those menopausal women that goes all dykey with the butch haircut.
not_available So Nate says that you're dating a hairdresser.
not_available That is so lucky.
not_available If he's good, I'd love to know if he can do anything with this mop.
not_available Does your boyfriend come around? He's not exactly my boyfriend.
not_available Oh, come on, you're blushing.
not_available Must be pretty serious.
not_available Is it? Is it serious, or is it just hot sex? I'm really not in the mood to discuss my personal life.
not_available You have one new message, Hey, it's me, Look, it's better if I just go by myself, You should probably just not worry about it, okay? Thank you for trying to To,,,, Look, just Thank you, So that's That's it, I guess, Goodbye, Claire, This is disgusting.
not_available You have crap in here from the '80s.
not_available Billy, I'll get a plumber, somebody who actually knows what they're doing.
not_available Would you look at me? I'd really like to talk to you.
not_available I take it you spoke to Mom and Dad.
not_available Look, I don't know what happened that day.
not_available You know, I was on new meds.
not_available They weren't working.
not_available It wasn't my fault.
not_available But don't worry.
not_available I've already been to my doctor and changed my dosage.
not_available And I already feel more even.
not_available Billy, I need to know if I should be worried about you.
not_available You shouldn't.
not_available I swear.
not_available Yeah? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available My God, you could eat off this skin.
not_available Angela does her job perfectly.
not_available What about the hairs in her mole? Rico would've never left those there.
not_available Angela had a long philosophical debate about it and decided the nieces would wanna remember her exactly how she was.
not_available I'd like to know the meaning of this.
not_available Nikolai is picking me up to go to dinner and I was planning to serve him sherry beforehand.
not_available I wanted to use the goblets I got from my cousin Hannah's trip to Dresden.
not_available Now I can't because someone broke this and hoped I wouldn't notice it.
not_available Which one of you did this?

not_available Okay.
not_available I thought you were gonna help.
not_available So how've you been? 
not_available Good.
not_available You? I'm okay.
not_available I've driven by hundreds of times, but I never knew this place existed.
not_available Is best restaurant in all of Los Angeles, and not outrageous prices too.
not_available Lotte, Irina.
not_available What a surprise this is.
not_available You usually do not come in on Tuesday night.
not_available Well, l 
not_available Can we join you? Please.
not_available Maybe another time.
not_available No, no, she says it's okay.
not_available So you must be Nicky's special friend we all keep hearing about.
not_available You must be thinking of someone else.
not_available No.
not_available You lost your husband.
not_available You work for Nicky.
not_available You used to fix dead people.
not_available Oh, I suppose that is me.
not_available This is Ruth.
not_available So that guy I saw you with at the club, is that a serious thing? Eddie? Not really.
not_available Not yet.
not_available Those drugs I saw you taking, is that a serious thing? No, no.
not_available I just tried them once.
not_available I don't think I'll be trying them again.
not_available I'm glad to hear you say that.
not_available You know what that shit has done to my sister.
not_available It can seriously fuck up your life, David.
not_available I'd hate to see that happen.
not_available It was stupid, I know.
not_available I was just You know, Rico left.
not_available It was just Nate and me.
not_available Not that it's an excuse.
not_available What's up with that kid I saw you with at the club? Let's just say it was a learning experience.
not_available Everyone else has gone home.
not_available I don't know what you two are waiting for.
not_available David, this isn't one of your regular shifts.
not_available Is there any special reason you showed up here tonight? No.
not_available Oh, well Well, good night, you two.
not_available Good night.
not_available You hungry? I'm always hungry.
not_available You fucking bitch! I would like to tear your heart out like you have torn out mine.
not_available There's supposed to be a picture of Nate peeing on a wall.
not_available I see it.
not_available I don't.
not_available Four from the left.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available What'd your mom say when she saw that? She was kind of horrified, I think.
not_available How is your mom? She's dating.
not_available It's weird.
not_available Why? 
not_available Because she's my mother.
not_available She's not supposed to date.
not_available People should be with people.
not_available Yeah, sometimes people are just too stupid to know it.
not_available How's your taco? Disgusting.
not_available I had no idea about you and Nikolai.
not_available For six years, every Saturday night, I cook for him dinner.
not_available And then he take me to a $2.50 movie on Fairfax.
not_available Then you come along, and he stop calling.
not_available I have to see every goddamn film this Freddie Prinze Jr.
not_available Does and what do I have to show for it? I'm sorry.
not_available Do you want to marry Nicky or not? Marriage is the last thing I would ever want again.
not_available Maybe I have an amusing flirtation with Nikolai but he scares me.
not_available Best of all, I have this job something I never would have predicted for myself.
not_available And I love it because it's mine.
not_available And I would never do anything to jeopardize that which means I should probably just finish dinner with Nikolai and go home.
not_available Thank you.
not_available I've had the best time coming to this funny restaurant and having you yell at me in the bathroom.
not_available Do you realize the whole time we were going out I was never in your bedroom at night? 
not_available Well you're here now, aren't you? Whoa, this is not the David I know.
not_available Maybe this is the real me.
not_available I'm not sure we should 
not_available Why not? Well, I'm kind of seeing somebody right now.
not_available I don't care.
not_available Well, I do.
not_available Come on, David! Why'd you come up here, if you weren't into something happening? To talk to you, to see how you were doing, to be friends.
not_available I don't wanna be friends.
not_available I wanna fuck.
not_available Well, I'm not into that.
not_available Can't we just have sex? It doesn't have to mean anything.
not_available It's getting late.
not_available I should just go.
not_available You take care of yourself.
not_available Claire, what are you doing here? I thought David and I covered for you, so you could be out having fun.
not_available What's wrong? Shit, there's this really big hole in my sock.
not_available Maybe Gabe just wanted to be alone.
not_available I know.
not_available Is he your boyfriend? 
not_available No.
not_available It's just he needs me.
not_available For the first time in my life, I felt important, like someone needed me you know, like, not just like some annoying extra person just lumped in with everyone else.
not_available No one's ever needed me.
not_available I need you.
not_available Right.
not_available I felt this really intense connection.
not_available Now it's just gone.
not_available And I want it back.
not_available I want him back.
not_available Is there something wrong with me? Is there something about me that makes me deserve something like this? Deserve what? Just feeling really close to someone then having them just disappear like I mean nothing.
not_available Claire, Gabe just went to visit his father for a day.
not_available I think you're talking about Dad.
not_available Look, we never talk about him.
not_available And that's okay, if that's what you want.
not_available But at some point you're gonna have to deal with how you feel.
not_available Oh, God, can't I just get upset without having to focus on what's really making me upset? Well, it worked for me for 34 years.
not_available Hey.
not_available Hey, who 's this? Jim.
not_available Who's this? Steve, So, what do you look like? I'm 6'2", 190 pounds.
not_available I'm a professional boxer.
not_available Yeah? What's your dick like? 
not_available Nine and a half inches, uncut.
not_available So, what are you looking for? 
not_available A nasty top to fuck my brains out, Found him.
not_available Now, get on your knees and suck my cock, boy.
not_available Oh, fuck, Yes, sir, Oh, yes, I don 't care what time it is, I need to be with someone, Someone, that's comforting.
not_available Okay, I wanna talk to you.
not_available If this is about Billy, I can't.
not_available I've done nothing but talk about Billy for two days.
not_available Well, what's happening with him? Look I know this is really hard for you.
not_available I've had some time to calm down about the picture so you can just spill your guts to me, okay? I promise not to make it about me.
not_available I'm too tired.
not_available You know what? I love you, and I need you.
not_available And it's okay for you to need me too.
not_available I want you to need me.
not_available I'm doing the best I can.
not_available Rough night, stud? You're fired.
not_available Fuck.
not_available Yoo
not_available hoo, Brenda! Brenda, I know you're home.
not_available Your car's out front.
not_available I don't know what's so strange about a spontaneous brunch.
not_available I think it's fun.
not_available It's weird.
not_available You don't do things like this.
not_available You pay people to do things like this.
not_available Oh, hello, Nate.
not_available Hey.
not_available Now I see why you're so upset that I'm here.
not_available My mother's come over to see if I talked Billy into committing himself.
not_available She just loves saying that.
not_available It makes her father and I sound more like monsters.
not_available Well, I didn't do it, and I'm not going to.
not_available Goddamn it! I asked for chives, and they give me this veggie crap.
not_available Brenda there's something you don't know about Billy.
not_available Oh, here we go.
not_available You know when you were in Europe that summer? Billy didn't try to kill himself.
not_available What? Your father and I had gotten back from a conference to find our house on fire.
not_available It started right below the family room.
not_available Remember, we had it redone when you were away? Yeah, but Billy was I went to visit him in the hospital.
not_available He was there all summer.
not_available Your father and I put him there.
not_available We had no choice.
not_available That fire wasn't accidental, Brenda.
not_available He was making a bomb.
not_available This is getting really fucking desperate.
not_available What, now Billy's the Unabomber? He had written things.
not_available Ugly, violent things about your father and me about you.
not_available He was dangerous.
not_available You let me believe for all these years that Billy tried to kill himself.
not_available We were only trying to protect you, honey.
not_available Get out of my house.
not_available Get out of my house, you fucking lunatic! 
not_available It's a wonder I'm even alive.
not_available Hello? You're like fucking Medea! 
not_available Dave, this is a really bad time.
not_available You know what the really sick thing is, Mother? You have no idea what you've done to me.
not_available Brenda.
not_available Brenda, hang on.
not_available I'll call you later, Nate when that asshole's out of my house.
not_available Dave, I gotta go.
not_available What, you fired her already? Oh, for chrissake.
not_available You should've lined up somebody.
not_available Why are you whispering? I'm hiding up here until she finishes Mrs.
not_available Sarno.
not_available So which of those other people did you like best? Look, let's not make any quick decisions.
not_available I guess I could probably live with the panic
not_available attack guy.
not_available I've got a better idea, Hey, Rico.
not_available Bad time? No, everyone's at lunch except me and Pam.
not_available You're one of the Fishers, aren't you? Cigarette break.
not_available But I gotta be back in 10 because I told Gilardi I'd have this one done when he got back.
not_available The subscriber you've called is outside the service Oh, great.
not_available Fucking hell.
not_available Here, let me help you.
not_available Shit.
not_available I don't know why I brought so much stuff here.
not_available I guess I'm just a nester.
not_available I should've told you that I broke the goblet.
not_available It was a gift from my cousin.
not_available Yeah, trip to Dresden.
not_available I heard.
not_available I don't know why I didn't just tell you.
not_available It's totally unlike me.
not_available I usually just say whatever I'm thinking.
not_available I noticed.
not_available But I saw that broken glass and I just was overcome with this feeling that it was better to just ignore it just pretend that it didn't happen.
not_available I get that feeling from all of you here.
not_available Everyone is so fragile and can't bear to hear anything.
not_available Is that everything? I mean, all I did was try to fix David up with this guy and I thought he was gonna kill me.
not_available I never met anyone who was so uptight about being gay.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You know something? I never worked in a funeral home that was this depressing.
not_available Tell me you're happier here, and I'll go.
not_available It's not perfect.
not_available These body farms are a fucking assembly line.
not_available And I've got like 12 idiots breathing down my neck.
not_available At Fisher &amp; Sons you only get two of those at the most.
not_available And Gilardi lied to me.
not_available My hours are nothing like he said they'd be.
not_available And the work here is not even as challenging, you know? Nate it was Kroehner who burned down the house across the street.
not_available Gilardi's told people that he's not done trying to drive you guys out of business.
not_available Does that mean it doesn't make sense for you to come back? No, but if I do, you have to match what I'm making here plus guarantee me flexible hours for picking up Julio and helping when the baby comes.
not_available Done.
not_available And if I do decide to come back it's not for good.
not_available I'm never gonna become a partner, am I? I can't offer you that unless you wanna marry Claire.
not_available No, thank you.
not_available Okay, I can start in a couple of days.
not_available Thank you.
not_available That makes me very happy, and it will make David very happy.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Hey, I heard there's some picture of you in a gallery peeing.
not_available Is that true? I just wanted to get Gabe's father's number, so I could talk to him.
not_available Well, why would Gabe's stepfather know where Gabe was? No, his father, the one who lives in Barstow.
not_available Yeah, Gabe's father died when he was 4.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Oh, if you should run into Gabe would you tell him I really don't appreciate his staying out all night? So that's That's it, I guess, Goodbye, Claire, Mrs.
not_available Dimas? Mrs.
not_available Dimas? Mrs.
not_available Dimas?

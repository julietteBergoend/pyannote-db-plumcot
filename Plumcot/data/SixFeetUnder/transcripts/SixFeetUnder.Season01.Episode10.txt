not_available So I say to this guy , " I can't do anything unless you give me an order number .
not_available And I don't appreciate your taking that tone of voice with me . "
not_available He says he doesn't have an order number .
not_available And I say , " Well , you should always write down the order number .
boring_man " Then he gets all pissy .
not_available Says he wants to speak to the person he ordered the Astoria floor lamp from .
not_available And I say , " Well , do you remember
not_available his or her " Right
not_available , you know ?
not_available " name? "
not_available And he says , " Of course not .
not_available "
not_available And I say , " Then I'm sorry , I can't help you . "
not_available He says this isn't the first time he had a problem ordering from us .
not_available Last Christmas he bought a CD holder , and it arrived all broken .
boring_man When we told him , " Send it back " he couldn't because he'd thrown away the box it came in .
not_available So I say I say , "
not_available Boo hoo , mister .
not_available Ain't you got it bad . "
not_available And he says , " I wanna talk to your supervisor .
not_available " And I say , " Of course you can talk to him but unfortunately , his hours are only 8:30 "
not_available So now the wife's in jail , according to the cousin who arranged the funeral .
nate_fisher I bet he was abusing her .
not_available Maybe he had some sick sexual thing he made her do .
not_available Please , stop .
not_available And you're wrong .
not_available All she told the police was that he was boring .
not_available That's it ?
not_available That's all she said ?
not_available The sick part is , I understand it .
not_available I do too .
not_available Sometimes I'm boring .
not_available I am too .
david_fisher I should be at both intakes with you this morning
nate_fisher but you'll have to do the casket meeting because I'm really backed up down here .
not_available David , maybe we need to think about finding a replacement for Rico .
not_available Why ?
not_available We're doing just fine without him .
not_available It's saving money , thank you very much .
nate_fisher Is there something you'd like to say about my work ?
not_available Look , you do a great job when it comes to people who had peaceful farewells .
not_available But the big reconstructions , you're out of your league .
not_available I see , so those who can't do , criticize ?
not_available We've got a body that's a page one rewrite .
not_available We got two more coming in from that nightclub fire in Valencia .
not_available How bad was that fire ?
david_fisher Well , this is where they ended up .
not_available Maybe the families want Open caskets .
not_available They already put in the requests .
not_available I'll put an ad in the paper today .
not_available It's taken care of .
job_applicant_1 I've scheduled some interviews for this afternoon .
not_available As you can see from my r'esum'e , I've had the good fortune to study under a variety of gifted restorative artists .
not_available Oh , you worked over at Hope Valley .
not_available I've known P.T .
job_applicant_1 For years .
not_available Look , that lawsuit about the unembalmed arm was not my fault .
not_available I took the fall for some bitch that was supposed to cover me for leaving early .
not_available Sometimes I wake up with a feeling of panic like my heart's gonna beat right out of my chest .
job_applicant_2 You know what I'm talking about .
not_available But after I spend a few extra hours in bed and do my chanting , the dark time usually passes .
not_available I know it sounds funny , but the first time I embalmed someone it felt like I was coming home .
not_available I just knew that this is what I was meant to do .
not_available That doesn't sound funny at all .
not_available There's something very intimate about it .
not_available I'm the last person on earth who gets to know these people .
david_fisher Anyway , I guess I take what I do very seriously .
not_available Well , I have no further questions .
not_available Me neither .
not_available Thanks for coming in , Angela .
not_available We'll be in touch .
not_available Great .
angela It was very nice to meet you .
not_available It was nice to meet you .
not_available Yeah .
nate_fisher Okay .
not_available I'll wait an hour before I call her .
not_available We don't wanna look desperate .
not_available Just find out if she can start tomorrow .
not_available David , David !
not_available David !
not_available Why are you standing there like that ?
david_fisher I was thinking .
not_available Isn't a person allowed to think ?
nate_fisher You're gonna wish you'd gotten high with me .
not_available I told you , I'm never getting high again .
brenda_chenowith Oh , doesn't Billy look great ?
not_available So handsome and confident .
david_fisher Yo , Billy !
not_available Would you excuse me for one moment ?
david_fisher Thanks for coming .
not_available I really appreciate it .
not_available Thank God you're here .
not_available My mouth is really dry , and is my breath bad ?
not_available No , it's fine .
billy_chenowith So truth .
not_available Is this show good , or is it just pretentious bullshit ?
not_available There're so many people , it's hard to see the pictures .
not_available This is Billy's best work ever , very disturbing .
not_available Really ?
not_available I'm so proud of you , God !
not_available Why is my mother here ?
not_available Oh , God .
not_available I invited her as part of my ongoing campaign to get her to like me .
not_available I didn't think she'd actually turn up .
not_available You know that some stranger just rubbed my ass ?
not_available Isn't this fabulous ?
not_available Oh , Billy , darling .
not_available Thanks , Mom .
not_available You can't keep him to yourself all the time .
not_available Okay , no offense , but your family is fucked up beyond comprehension .
not_available She's completely tanked .
not_available I brought someone .
not_available I hope that's okay .
not_available Hey , Nikolai .
not_available Hello , Nate , how are you ?
not_available This is Brenda .
not_available Good evening .
not_available Hello , dear .
not_available It's good to see you , Mrs .
not_available Fisher .
not_available Where's Hiram ?
margaret_chenowith He's visiting his son in Portland .
margaret_chenowith I'm serious , darling , this new stuff is really visceral .
not_available Not at all left brained like your father .
not_available Yeah .
not_available Hey , so where is Dad ?
not_available Oh , honey , Bern sends his regrets .
not_available He's just heartsick .
not_available Unfortunately , he's treating one of his patients who's undergoing a complete psychotic break at the moment .
billy_chenowith That always seems to happen whenever there's something important in my life .
not_available I guess that's just typical Bernard
not_available I'm sorry ,
not_available Bernard Chenowith behavior .
not_available Pretentious dick .
not_available Now , you just hush .
not_available I thought this would be paintings .
not_available I could take photographs .
not_available That doesn't mean they'd be any good .
not_available Mrs .
not_available Fisher , I've never seen you having this much fun .
not_available Oh , no , no , no , it's great .
not_available I am having fun just watching you .
not_available Hey , Mr . Seattle co op hippie boy .
not_available Oh , Margaret Chenowith .
not_available Who are you ?
not_available Ruth Fisher .
not_available Nate's mother .
margaret_chenowith That explains why you're looking at me
not_available like I just took a giant dump on your lawn .
not_available If I knew you were putting on a show tonight I would've bought tickets for all my friends .
not_available Goody , there's Dr . Feinberg .
brenda_chenowith Hi .
not_available What is he doing here ?
not_available I invited him .
not_available Gareth Feinberg , the guy who wrote the book ?
not_available Yeah , he wrote Charlottefucking Light and Dark ,
not_available He's a fucking evil dead fish of a fucking Nazi fuck .
margaret_chenowith Darling , try not to act so adolescent .
not_available It only makes you look bad .
not_available As opposed to being drunk and slobbering all over my boyfriend who , by the way , is completely not interested .
not_available Isn't this fun ?
not_available Billy , Billy , Billy .
not_available It's quite powerful stuff .
not_available It's It's potent .
not_available That's a word Dr .
not_available Feinberg likes to use a lot .
not_available Brenda , I see a lot of you in these photographs .
not_available Hello , Gareth .
not_available Margaret .
not_available Does this have a theme ?
not_available I know you like your things to have a theme .
not_available Mother , nothing is more tedious than when you look for meaning in my work .
not_available I don't need your fucking approval .
not_available Excuse me .
not_available Isn't that beautiful ?
not_available Yeah , it is .
not_available He's good .
brenda_chenowith Yeah , he is really good .
brenda_chenowith I only wish he'd believe that .
not_available This one's got real attitude .
not_available Oh , my God .
not_available The light's spectacular .
not_available Brenda , that is a picture of me urinating on a wall .
not_available I realize that .
not_available Hey , what do you think ?
not_available So now you're stalking me ?
not_available No , I just saw you one day when I was taking pictures
nate_fisher so I followed you .
not_available You were just out taking pictures ?
not_available You live in Venice !
not_available There's no reason for you to be in my neighborhood .
not_available You think the world revolves around you .
not_available Bren , would you tell him , please , this isn't about him ?
brenda_chenowith It's what Billy does .
not_available He takes pictures of people when they're off guard .
not_available He's got a talent .
not_available It's art .
not_available No , it's fucked !
not_available Thanks a lot .
not_available Look .
not_available That's your son pissing against a wall .
not_available So I should let him humiliate me whenever he wants ?
not_available Oh , God , Nate , don't make this about you .
not_available Why the fuck not ?
nate_fisher This is about me .
not_available You make enough stuff all about you .
not_available So what ?
not_available There's a picture of you pissing on a wall .
not_available Who got hurt ?
not_available Who died ?
not_available You don't think I have a right to not be spied upon ?
not_available You're talking to someone who was spied on her whole life .
not_available God , Billy is severely fucked up , Bren .
not_available I don't like being stalked by a psycho .
not_available Billy is not psychotic .
not_available He has a disease .
not_available He's fine when he takes his meds .
not_available Yeah ,
not_available well , when the fuck is that ?
not_available Look , has he ever done anything weird ?
brenda_chenowith Yeah , he's bipolar .
not_available His whole life he's been weird .
not_available Has he ever done anything dangerous ?
not_available Oh , God .
brenda_chenowith Nate , no .
not_available The only person Billy would ever be a threat to is himself .
not_available Has he ever tried to ?
not_available Yes .
not_available When I was 18 .
brenda_chenowith I went to Europe for three months .
not_available It was this big reward for me winning a scholarship to Yale .
brenda_chenowith When I got back to L.A. , my mother was at the airport .
brenda_chenowith She told me that Billy had committed suicide .
not_available My whole life just collapsed in on itself in that moment .
not_available Of course , she meant to say that Billy had tried to commit suicide .
nate_fisher She was drunk , or else it was a Freudian slip .
not_available You never went to Yale .
not_available Billy was in a hospital in Pasadena .
not_available I took some classes at UCLA in the spring .
not_available Then in the fall , he was diagnosed manic depressive which kicks in in adolescence
nate_fisher so it probably had nothing to do with me getting the scholarship .
not_available I can't believe they pressured you into sacrificing your life for your brother .
brenda_chenowith Nobody pressured me .
not_available I wanted to stay .
not_available Morning .
not_available Morning .
not_available Pee on any walls lately ?
not_available Shut up .
not_available So , Mom , what's with you and Nikolai ?
not_available I don't know what you're talking about .
not_available And Dave , what'd you do last night ?
not_available Nothing .
not_available Saturday night , what happened to that ?
not_available Person you're seeing ?
not_available That person is no longer in the picture .
not_available Sorry to hear it .
not_available What about you ?
not_available You dating anybody ?
not_available No .
claire_fisher If you are , you don't need to hide him from us like we're lepers .
not_available I'm not dating anyone .
not_available I've just been hanging out a lot with somebody .
not_available Who is this person ?
not_available Nobody .
not_available David , I'm ready to go to church .
not_available Thanks , guys .
not_available Hey , Joey , the kid's ready , So am I
not_available , This is the most terrifying shower scene since Psycho .
not_available That football game used to make this obnoxious noise when you scored a touchdown .
not_available Do you wanna
not_available show me how to play it ?
not_available No .
not_available You know , there's this
not_available There's this little kid next door and the only toy he's got
not_available is this stupid Mousetrap game from when his mom was a kid .
not_available Maybe , you know , he'd want some of these .
not_available It's a beautiful day .
not_available Why would you waste your Sunday in here watching TV ?
not_available What are you doing ?
not_available I thought that Tony Rechner next door might want some of these .
not_available Just keep your hands off them .
not_available She doesn't even look me in the eyes anymore .
not_available Come on
not_available , I wanna show you something funny .
not_available Come on .
not_available Come on .
angela We're going on a field trip ?
not_available This is like the first day of school .
not_available I am so excited .
not_available Oh , and I just wanna apologize in advance because I had calamari last night for dinner .
not_available What do you mean ?
not_available Let's just say this is one time where the strong smell of formaldehyde really comes in handy .
angela So then I said , " I don't care if you have a low sperm count .
angela I mean , I'll just shove a turkey baster up there if I have to .
not_available " I mean , I wanna have a child before I turn 40 .
not_available That's fair , right ?
not_available Hello , everyone .
not_available Hi .
not_available How was church ?
not_available Nate told me you're a deacon .
not_available That's adorable .
nate_fisher I see you've made yourself at home .
angela Angela doesn't like to feel constrained .
not_available Well , you know , my glands go double time .
david_fisher I find if I wear too much while I work , I get all pitted .
not_available Angela , we're sort of used to a more professional appearance around here .
not_available Give me a break , David , they're just nipples .
not_available I mean , we've all seen them .
not_available We've all touched them .
not_available We've all sucked on them .
not_available It's not like this guy will be lying in the casket and people will be saying , " Oh , my God , the embalmer's nipples were hard .
not_available " They'll be saying , " How did they put his face back together after he went through the goddamn windshield? " I told Father Jack
not_available I'd help with the food distribution downtown .
not_available I just wanted to make sure that your first day was going
not_available okay .
not_available Well , thanks .
not_available I'm all gassy , but that's not your fault .
not_available Angela had calamari last night .
not_available Boy , he's a barrel of laughs .
not_available It's hard when a new person comes into a situation , It throws everything off balance .
not_available Bren , I am not threatened by your boyfriend .
brenda_chenowith Oh , yeah ?
not_available Your behavior consistently communicates otherwise .
not_available You want the picture out of the show , fine .
not_available But don't spout psychobabble at me like fucking Margaret and Bernard .
not_available You're , like , becoming them .
not_available Fuck you !
not_available You know what you did was wrong .
not_available That's why you didn't show it to me .
not_available Why are you making it such a big deal ?
not_available Because I love him !
not_available You're fucking with my life , Billy , and it's not fair .
not_available You have to stop .
not_available Or what ?
not_available Goddamn it , Billy , what is it with you ?
not_available You like fucking with my brain like Feinberg ?
not_available Thank you .
not_available You're welcome .
not_available Can I get you anything else ?
not_available I can always use a good blowjob .
not_available Hey , do I get my fucking lunch or not ?
not_available I'm going to get a drink of water .
not_available Yeah , sure .
not_available Melinda Daner , Mark Whitman Darryl Heinz , Keith Charles .
not_available Okay , well , just tell them we'll meet them at the usual corner on Tuesday .
not_available Okay .
not_available Hi , Tracy .
not_available Oh , hi , David .
not_available How have you been ?
not_available Fine .
not_available I love your new hair .
not_available What are you working on ?
not_available St .
not_available Stephen's is sending over some volunteers to help out next week .
not_available Someone told me that you used to go to St .
not_available Stephen's .
tracy_montrose_blair Not that I've been asking around about you .
not_available It just came up naturally .
not_available So did you ?
david_fisher Go there , I mean .
not_available Yeah , just for a few months last year .
not_available They're a very progressive church .
not_available Yes , they are .
not_available The guy who took these is a total psycho .
not_available It's good .
not_available Well , we should probably get going if we wanna see that movie .
not_available I should probably get home and check on my mom .
not_available I'm sure she's doing fine .
not_available I'm sorry .
not_available It's not like I was dying to see a movie .
not_available That's not what I'm talking about .
not_available I'm sorry about what happened between us .
gabe_dimas I never meant for those assholes to write shit on your car .
gabe_dimas I shouldn't have told Andy about us .
not_available I was just being stupid .
not_available That was me being really , really , really stupid
not_available and I'm sorry .
not_available Well , thank you .
not_available Look , I don't wanna make a big deal out of this .
not_available All I'm saying is , I sat around last week in that stupid getup
not_available you wanted me to wear and had to say all this , you know , " Daddy this " and " Daddy that " bullshit .
not_available When I tell you I keep reading articles about having this one hour orgasm
not_available well , the least you could do is try to help me have one .
not_available I'm sorry men can't have it .
not_available Since you guys get everything else on the planet it seems like a fair tradeoff .
not_available Fine .
nate_fisher Goodbye .
not_available You know , Angela , my brother likes a certain decorum when you're working with someone's loved one .
not_available Yeah ?
not_available Well , the personal calls are probably a little uncool .
not_available Oh , right , got it .
not_available I won't do it when he's around .
not_available Hello .
not_available Hey .
not_available Really ?
not_available Why don't you want me to come over ?
not_available Damn it , Brenda , you always do this .
nate_fisher You're shutting me out .
not_available Look , the pissing thing is no longer an issue , I swear .
not_available Look , maybe you'd feel better if I came over .
not_available All right , fine , whatever .
not_available Fine .
not_available Girlfriend trouble ?
angela Not really trouble .
angela Tell me what the fight was about , and I'll tell you what to say to fix it .
not_available I mean , trust me , this is my thing .
nate_fisher We didn't have a fight .
not_available She just pulls away from me at the weirdest times .
not_available Well , maybe she senses that you're pulling away
not_available so she just does it first .
not_available Maybe you should mind your own business .
angela Shoot .
not_available I guess this means I can't ask about the pissing ?
not_available Because I had an ex who wanted to pee on me , and I wasn't grossed out .
not_available I mean , I just thought it was kind of silly .
not_available But that's me .
not_available Thank you for taking me to the art gallery last night .
not_available I thought you hated those pictures .
not_available No , no , it's just that I don't like them , that's all .
not_available But it was nice to be spending time with you .
not_available I mean , outside of working together .
not_available Would you like to go to dinner sometime ?
not_available Is that like a date ?
nikolai Of course not .
not_available Good , I pick you up tomorrow night , 8:00 .
not_available I don't wanna go ,
not_available okay ?
not_available Just stop asking me .
not_available Okay , fine .
gabe_dimas I was only inviting you to be nice .
not_available Nobody even wants you there because you've been acting so weird lately .
not_available Gabe ?
not_available We have to be someplace .
not_available Get lost , Morticia .
not_available Shut up , peanut testicle .
not_available Fuck off , the both of you .
not_available What's his problem ?
not_available Nothing .
gabe_dimas He wants me to go to this party tomorrow .
not_available I'm just not in the mood .
not_available We can do something if you want .
not_available Actually , I gotta go to Barstow tomorrow and spend the night at my dad's .
not_available I gotta ask him for money for my mom .
not_available Not that he's gonna give it to me , but
gabe_dimas Well , do you want company ?
not_available Claire , you don't have to keep taking care of me .
not_available I'm not .
not_available I just like hanging out .
not_available We could just go for the drive .
not_available Then you go see your dad
not_available and I'll stay in some , like , creepy motel and read a Stephen King book .
not_available Okay .
not_available Meet me after fifth period tomorrow by the gym .
dr_bernard_chenowith Oh , this is just what I need today .
not_available I see this is payback time for my missing your opening .
not_available Just shut up !
not_available Both of you , for once , just shut your fucking mouths .
not_available All that comes out of you is garbage , garbage , garbage !
not_available Okay .
not_available Good , we have a dialogue .
not_available Where did you get this ?
not_available From his office .
not_available It's all the data Feinberg has on Brenda .
not_available It's all destroyed .
not_available He can go to where he came from before he fucked her up .
not_available You're off the hook .
not_available Obviously , this has nothing to do with you missing his show .
not_available Don't fucking talk about me
not_available like I'm not here !
not_available Even though I'm not and never have been .
not_available Son , what's wrong ?
not_available Just tell us .
billy_chenowith There's nothing wrong with me .
not_available I didn't sell my daughter to some smug , starfucking psychiatrist so he could pick her apart like a goddamn cadaver and turn her into shit and garbage just like everything you touch !
not_available Billy , sweetheart You bitch !
billy_chenowith You're the fucking nurse .
not_available You wanna tie us up , lock us in a room , leave us to die .
not_available Well , you're the one that should die , you and him !
not_available You don't get to touch the children .
not_available I refuse to be an audience for this .
not_available Oh , boy .
angela You can juice her , but you better let me take care of that skin .
not_available This guy has a really sinewy neck .
angela Sinewy .
not_available I love saying that word , don't you ?
not_available I don't know .
not_available I went out with this guy once he had a really sinewy neck .
not_available He was a total animal in bed .
not_available I mean , the things he could do with his tongue .
not_available He thought he was God's gift to women .
angela I guess in that one respect he was .
not_available So do you like sinewy necks , David ?
not_available I never really thought about it .
angela Hey , I'm just trying to figure out your type .
not_available Believe me , I can tell you're single .
angela And I know about a million people I can set you up with .
david_fisher So , what kind of guys do you like ?
not_available What makes you think that I like men ?
not_available Oh , please , let's not play that game .
not_available I think we should fire her .
not_available I'm thinking the same thing .
not_available Has she made a lot of mistakes ?
nate_fisher No .
david_fisher She's a little hard to take .
not_available She's a lot hard to take .
ruth_fisher Sometimes people are hard to take but only because the first side they present is annoying or aggressive because they're nervous .
not_available After you spend some time with them you realize maybe there's another side to them
not_available that's worth knowing .
not_available Or not .
not_available I have no idea what I'm talking about .
ruth_fisher Sorry I'm late .
not_available By the way , I won't be here for dinner tomorrow , so everyone's on their own .
not_available Actually , I'm going to be volunteering with the food distribution .
not_available Well , that leaves you and me , Claire .
not_available You wanna go to the Apple Pan ?
not_available Can't .
not_available I have to do this astronomy overnight thing at the observatory for school .
not_available I didn't hear about this .
not_available I told you .
not_available You probably weren't listening .
claire_fisher That's the type of thing I would listen to .
not_available David and Nate did it when they went to Bonaventure .
david_fisher David , you did this ?
not_available Yeah , I had to .
not_available You too , Nate ?
not_available Back then we thought Pluto was a planet .
not_available When did Pluto stop being a planet ?
not_available A few months ago .
dr_bernard_chenowith Well , I suppose it's okay for you to go .
not_available Luckily , Gareth isn't going to press charges .
not_available But I did promise him that steps would be taken to remedy the situation .
brenda_chenowith I wish I'd been there to see the look on Feinberg's face .
not_available I'm sure he started with his whole blinking thing .
not_available Brenda , we have a serious problem .
not_available Okay , I'll talk to Billy's doctor , see if he needs to be on different medication .
not_available We were thinking of something a little more involved .
not_available Your mother and I feel that he needs to go away for intensive therapy .
not_available There's a very good facility in Colorado .
not_available You wanna put Billy in an institution ?
not_available Oh , please , let's not turn this into a 1950s B movie .
not_available This place is run by excellent psychiatric specialists who may have some creative solution to help Billy .
not_available You wanna give him shock treatment .
dr_bernard_chenowith Darling , really , this dramatic streak , aren't you a little old for it ?
not_available And just for the record , electroconvulsive therapy's had a real resurgence in the last 10 years with very impressive results .
not_available You can't do this .
not_available We think it's best .
not_available It certainly makes your lives easier .
brenda_chenowith God forbid Billy
not_available should embarrass you in front of your stupid celebrity friends .
not_available Unfortunately , he's an adult which means you can't have him committed unless he does something dangerous .
not_available Darling ?
not_available We were thinking if you talked to him , explained how it would help him
not_available Fuck you both .
not_available You're out of your minds .
angela Hi , I'm Angela .
not_available You must be Ruth .
not_available Yes .
not_available I spilled some beet salad on someone's wig
not_available so David said I should eat up here .
not_available I got the stains out .
not_available Everyone in my family gets cancer , so I know tons about taking care of wigs .
not_available Is that yours ?
ruth_fisher The hair , I mean .
not_available As far as I know .
not_available It's beautiful .
angela Thank you .
not_available I don't wanna be one of those menopausal women that goes all dykey with the butch haircut .

not_available but he scares me .
not_available Best of all , I have this job something I never would have predicted for myself .
ruth_fisher And I love it because it's mine .
not_available And I would never do anything to jeopardize that which means I should probably just finish dinner with Nikolai and go home .
not_available Thank you .

not_available You pay people to do things like this .
not_available Oh , hello , Nate .
not_available Hey .
not_available Now I see why you're so upset that I'm here .
not_available My mother's come over to see if I talked Billy into committing himself .
not_available She just loves saying that .

not_available He was there all summer .
not_available Your father and I put him there .
not_available We had no choice .
not_available That fire wasn't accidental , Brenda .

not_available This is getting really fucking desperate .
not_available What , now Billy's the Unabomber ?
not_available He had written things .
not_available Ugly , violent things about your father and me about you .
not_available He was dangerous .
not_available You let me believe for all these years that Billy tried to kill himself .
not_available We were only trying to protect you , honey .

not_available Oh , for chrissake .
not_available You should've lined up somebody .
david_fisher Why are you whispering ?
david_fisher I'm hiding up here until she finishes Mrs . Sarno .
not_available So which of those other people did you like best ?
not_available Look , let's not make any quick decisions .
not_available I guess I could probably live with the panic attack guy .
not_available I've got a better idea , Hey , Rico .
not_available Bad time ?
not_available No , everyone's at lunch except me and Pam .
not_available You're one of the Fishers , aren't you ?

not_available The subscriber you've called is outside the service
not_available Oh , great .
ruth_fisher Fucking hell .
not_available Here , let me help you .
not_available Shit .
not_available I don't know why I brought so much stuff here .
not_available I guess I'm just a nester .
not_available I should've told you that I broke the goblet .
angela It was a gift from my cousin .
not_available Yeah , trip to Dresden .
not_available I heard .
not_available I don't know why I didn't just tell you .
angela It's totally unlike me .
not_available I usually just say whatever I'm thinking .
not_available I noticed .
angela But I saw that broken glass
angela and I just was overcome with this feeling that it was better to just ignore
angela it just pretend that it didn't happen .
not_available I get that feeling from all of you here .
not_available Everyone is so fragile and can't bear to hear anything .
not_available Is that everything ?
not_available I mean , all I did was try to fix David up with this guy
not_available and I thought he was gonna kill me .
not_available I never met anyone who was so uptight about being gay .
not_available Thanks .
angela You know something ?
not_available I never worked in a funeral home that was this depressing .
not_available Tell me you're happier here , and I'll go .
not_available It's not perfect .
not_available These body farms are a fucking assembly line .
not_available And I've got like 12 idiots breathing down my neck .
not_available At Fisher &amp ; Sons you only get two of those at the most .
federico_diaz And Gilardi lied to me .
not_available My hours are nothing like he said they'd be .
not_available And the work here is not even as challenging , you know ?
federico_diaz Nate it was Kroehner who burned down the house across the street .
not_available Gilardi's told people that he's not done trying to drive you guys out of business .
not_available Does that mean it doesn't make sense for you to come back ?
not_available No ,
not_available but if I do , you have to match what I'm making here plus guarantee me flexible hours for picking up Julio and helping when the baby comes .
not_available Done .
not_available And if I do decide to come back
not_available it's not for good .
not_available I'm never gonna become a partner , am I ?
not_available I can't offer you that unless you wanna marry Claire .
not_available No , thank you .
not_available Okay , I can start in a couple of days .
not_available Thank you .
not_available That makes me very happy , and it will make David very happy .
not_available Yeah .
not_available Hey , I heard there's some picture of you in a gallery peeing .
not_available Is that true ?
not_available I just wanted to get Gabe's father's number , so I could talk to him .
not_available Well , why would Gabe's stepfather know where Gabe was ?
not_available No , his father , the one who lives in Barstow .
not_available Yeah , Gabe's father died when he was 4 .
vickie_dimas Yeah .
not_available Oh , if you should run into Gabe would you tell him I really don't appreciate his staying out all night ?
not_available So that's
not_available That's it
not_available , I guess , Goodbye , Claire , Mrs . Dimas ?
not_available Mrs .
not_available Dimas ?
not_available Mrs .
not_available Dimas ?

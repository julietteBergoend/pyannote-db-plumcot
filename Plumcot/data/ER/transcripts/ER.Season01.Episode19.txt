not_available Find the deepest pockets of fluid without fetal parts or umbilical cord.
not_available You mark each corner of the quadrant.
not_available Measure and then add up.
not_available ls that what this number is over here? That's the baby's heart rate.
not_available That should be between 1 20 and 1 60.

not_available l just spoke with Dr.
not_available Coburn, our OB attending.
not_available And she agrees that we need to deliver you soon.
not_available Will you have to do a Csection? 
not_available l want to deliver naturally.
not_available Your eclampsia's under control, the baby's good and the cervix is favorable.
not_available l'd say we do a trial of labor.
not_available And if it doesn't work? l think it will work.
not_available l want to give it a try.
not_available Let's do it! Excuse me.
not_available Do you feel competent to handle this without me? 
not_available l think l can muddle through.
not_available l'll check back with you at 2300? Roger.

not_available Sounds like the cast of Finian's Rainbow.
not_available Sorry.
not_available Hunter? Hunter O'Brian? You agree with my assessment? Your labor's progressing along nicely and quickly.
not_available The baby's great.
not_available ls it normal for the heart rate to be going down like that? As long as it's only briefly, and it stays over 1 20.
not_available Jared's on both lists.
not_available lt's not my favorite.
not_available Compromise is the soul of marriage.
not_available Jared, it is.
not_available Jared.
not_available Hope you feel better.

not_available How are we doing? 
not_available l'll have an epidural.
not_available Contractions are three minutes apart.
not_available No kidding! 
not_available Tracing showing decreased activity.
not_available What's that? The baby's heart rate is reacting less than it should.

not_available He was just sleeping.

not_available And I'm sorry.
not_available How is she? Fine.
not_available In and out, 20 minutes.
not_available Peter, listen.
not_available That was a difficult diagnosis.
not_available Lots of surgeons would've missed it.
not_available Because a lot of them don't take the time to listen to their patients.
not_available The good ones do.
not_available I'm doing a Whipple procedure.
not_available Care to assist? A Whipple? Are you kidding? Patient's a 62year

not_available Where's the gall bladder? What do you know? Someone took it out.
not_available Must've been diseased.
not_available You still got yours though, don't you? It's down there somewhere.
not_available Where are you taking me this time? A social worker is going to take you to the Presbyterian Home.
not_available I can't stay with my mom? The truth is that your mother's very sick.
not_available It's not her fault.
not_available She hasn't done anything wrong.
not_available But to help her get better, she's being sent to the psychiatric hospital.
not_available I hate her.
not_available I don't think that's true.
not_available Listen, your mama loves you very much.
not_available Then why is this happening? I wish I could tell you.

not_available Who performed it? I did.
not_available Walt, I'm sorry 
not_available Our 10th anniversary.
not_available I know, I got held up in O.R.
not_available No, no, no! Don't hand me that ''O.R.'' crap.
not_available I know how important your work is compared to the small events of my life.
not_available Walt, I'm sorry.
not_available We don't ask much.
not_available Practically nothing.
not_available Just that once in a while you come and sit with your mother so your sister and I can be together.
not_available And you act like you're doing us a favor! Okay.
not_available All right, Walt My next three nights off I'll come and sit with her.
not_available I promise.
not_available I forgot, man.
not_available I swear I'm sorry.
not_available Funny how that happens when it comes to your family.
not_available You off? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me too.
not_available Twelve whole hours.
not_available When you back on? Tomorrow.
not_available If I come back.
not_available You serious? I can't remember even why I'm doing this.
not_available You wanna be a doctor, right? Benton told my adviser I was doing a generally adequate job.
not_available And that was before today.
not_available I don't belong here.
not_available What kind of drugs is that guy on? Help! Help! My wife is having a baby! It's coming.
not_available I can feel it! 
not_available That's the head.
not_available What do I do? You take it.
not_available I'll get help.
not_available You're gonna be fine.
not_available Your baby's coming.
not_available All you have to do is lie back and push.
not_available Okay? Whenever you're ready.
not_available That's it, just push.
not_available Push! Push.
not_available That's it, push.
not_available Okay.
not_available One final push now.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on.
not_available That's it.
not_available You're doing great.

not_available Okay, one final push.
not_available Come on, just push.
not_available That's it, okay.

not_available Move the cord out of the way.
not_available That's it.
not_available That's it.
not_available That's it.
not_available It's a girl! You all right? You got her? Over there.
not_available Get the lock.
not_available Yes! Yes! 
not_available Hey, Doug.
not_available Hey, John.
not_available This is a bad idea.
not_available Who is it? Doug Ross.
not_available What are you doing? Nothing.
not_available My car broke down and the tow truck was taking so long I thought I would use your phone.
not_available I'm late for my date.
not_available You know, I see the tow truck right there.
not_available I'm really sorry.
not_available What were you thinking? What could you possibly have thought would happen tonight? That you would come to my doorstep at midnight, drunk and I would find that as some sort of grand gesture of love? Is that what you were thinking? That you can just show up? I'll invite you back in my life? In my bed? Is that what you imagined? 
not_available I don't know.
not_available You have no right to do this! I'm sorry.
not_available Do you think that you love me? For how long, Doug? How long till you start wondering if there isn't someone better in the next room? How long till you're reminded of all the 22year
not_available olds you could be screwing tomorrow or the next day? I will not let you do this to me again.
not_available I'm sorry.

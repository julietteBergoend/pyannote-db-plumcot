not_available We treated this older couple today.
not_available They were married 48 years.
not_available They seemed pretty happy about it.

not_available How do you know? How did they know? Because if it were us, we wouldn't be doing this.
not_available We'd both be married have daughters in Girl Scouts be renting The Lion King.
not_available We'd never have met, because we'd already be committed to somebody else.
not_available Don't you want that? Not now.
not_available Not with me? Same thing.
not_available Then why don't l want it? Because you are afraid.

not_available Mr.
not_available Carter.
not_available Have you ever noticed the piano showroom on the Eisenhower Expressway? And so then she blurts out, ''He's infertile.'' Susan, that's my best story of the new year.
not_available Sorry, it's just been another incredibly hateful day with Kayson.
not_available Well, you buy into it.
not_available You can't let him ride you like that.
not_available l put salt on them.
not_available Shouldn't eat salt.
not_available What are you doing? 
not_available l need more Tabasco.
not_available You haven't tasted them yet.
not_available Don't need to.
not_available But if you haven't tasted them
not_available You have a problem with this? No.
not_available Absolutely not.
not_available Saw Chloe wandering around the halls today.
not_available She was so calm l hardly recognized her.
not_available Thanks, Mark.
not_available Sorry, that was stupid.
not_available They're moving to Texas.
not_available Ronnie will dig for oil, and she'll have his baby.
not_available Assuming it is his baby.
not_available Why don't they stay here? 
not_available l told her to get an abortion.
not_available Why'd you do that? 
not_available Because l think she should.
not_available That's not very supportive.
not_available Supportive of what? My sister's fantasy of having a child? She thinks it's like having a pet.
not_available A little puppy who will follow her and love her forever who won't care that she's an alcoholic and abuses drugs that she gets diseases from sleeping with every guy on the corner.
not_available This baby may turn her around.
not_available You don't know.
not_available Like the one we delivered this afternoon? 
not_available Maybe.
not_available l don't know.
not_available Well, l do.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available That's the point.
not_available None of us do.
not_available Chloe and the baby will have a chance.
not_available Who are you to decide? l'm her sister.
not_available l pick up the pieces.
not_available lt's still her choice.
not_available l would support it if she'd ever taken any responsibility for her life before taking on another.
not_available l love her, but she can't even part her hair.
not_available So do l think she should bring a child into this world? No, l do not.
not_available Kayson? Vennerbeck is dead, Dr.
not_available Lewis.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available l've reviewed his file.
not_available He shouldn't have been released.
not_available You approved it.
not_available l didn't have all the information.
not_available What information? Two months ago he had back pain.
not_available The diagnosis was musculoskeletal.
not_available lt was atypical angina, and you should've told me.
not_available You didn't ask for his medical history.
not_available Do l have to ask for everything? What are you suggesting? l am suggesting this case was more complicated than you thought.
not_available That your experience was not sufficient to either determine that or to present it to those who could.
not_available l presented what you asked for.
not_available But not the entire picture! And because of that, a man is dead.
not_available And his wife is consulting their attorney.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morgenstern is aware of this situation.
not_available And l have requested a full case review.
not_available Susan, EMT's pulling up.
not_available Woman in respiratory arrest.

not_available l asked you to take that boy with the laceration.
not_available Haleh, what are you doing here? 
not_available Why didn't you? Carter could handle it.
not_available What's the problem? The problem is l asked you to treat him and hoped maybe you'd talk to him.
not_available l had a patient to see in Recovery.
not_available The hell you did.
not_available You just didn't want to be involved.
not_available Okay.
not_available Whoa, wait a minute.
not_available Am l supposed to be the Big Brothers program? l'm supposed to turn every gang kid in here into Nelson Mandela? l know you'd never do that, Peter.
not_available That's why l never asked you before.
not_available l've known Mookie since he was four years old and he was a sweet kid.
not_available And maybe someone will get through to him and he will be that again someday.
not_available Probably wouldn't be half as tough as getting through to you.
not_available What about metabolic causes? Hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis? Blood tests rule that out.
not_available We know it can't be arrhythmia or an Ml.
not_available Negative CT rules out mass lesion and trauma.
not_available Benton gave him narcan? And an amp of D
not_available 50.
not_available The blood was normal except for the elevated white count.
not_available Up to 1 4,500.

not_available Who's in there now? 
not_available Dalton.
not_available George Dalton? The guy can't close a door, much less an incision.
not_available Yeah, who are you telling? l once saw him try to connect a ureter to a sigmoid colon.
not_available You think that's bad? l watched him do a beautiful right fem
not_available pop bypass on a femoral artery.
not_available The left femoral artery.
not_available What'd he say to the patient? ''There's some good news and, well, there's some bad news.'' ''Well, sir, the operation was a success.'' ''But it was the wrong leg.'' That was terrific.
not_available Thank you, Dr.
not_available Dalton.
not_available lt was good.
not_available lt really was.
not_available Thanks a lot.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, you don't mind if we take Dr.

not_available Thanks, Jerry.
not_available Couldn't wait till tonight? l wish.
not_available Judge Franklin called.

not_available The guy's nuts.
not_available He's an appellate judge.
not_available So what? lt's the first thing you've written.
not_available What do you expect? Something better which he'll personally lead me in at tonight's meeting.
not_available l called my mom.

not_available l just wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
not_available So you showed up drunk with a guy you met an hour ago? Oh, l did not! Billy cares about me so just leave him out of it.
not_available l think he is already out of it.
not_available ls he staying at my place too? Did he help you steal the TV? Oh, you shut up.
not_available You just shut up, Susie.
not_available You are just like Mom.
not_available You're just like Dad.
not_available You just always hate everything that l do.
not_available That is not true and you know it.
not_available Nothing was any different at home for me than it was for you.
not_available Sure! 
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available l don't know why l'm having this conversation.
not_available They never thought l could do anything, you know? Do you think they thought l could become a doctor? l had to prove it to them.
not_available Sometimes l still have to, every day.
not_available You don't know anything about every day! You don't know.
not_available You don't have to worry about paying the rent.
not_available You don't have to worry about where you'll sleep.
not_available You don't have to worry about getting a job! Calm down.
not_available lt's gonna be okay.
not_available You're safe here, Chloe.
not_available Do you understand? Dr.
not_available Benton's going to fix your hand.
not_available And then, if you want, you and l can talk through all this.
not_available Okay? You are pathetic.
not_available What are you doing back? l thought Jennifer was in town.
not_available So did l.
not_available l thought you had a date with the drug lady.
not_available She went to a lecture on cardiomyopathy instead.
not_available Wow.
not_available That stings.
not_available Actually, l'm glad.
not_available She might be a little perky for me.
not_available Perky? l thought you liked perky.
not_available Well, this is true.
not_available But lately l've found myself attracted to sullen and withdrawn and confused.
not_available You ought to go out with me.
not_available l am out with you.
not_available Oh, my.
not_available Oh, my.
not_available Come on! l'm the short guy out here.
not_available There's nothing, you know, wrong with a little infantile schoolyard competition to kind of boost the spirits.
not_available Here we go.
not_available A little game of oneon
not_available one, to 21 .
not_available A buck a point.
not_available You're on.
not_available All right, you ready? Through the legs.
not_available They're stitching her up now.
not_available She can sleep it off tonight in Room 3 and Benton will find somewhere to throw Billy.
not_available He ought to find somewhere to lock him up.
not_available Told you, l don't like surprises.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available lt's all right.
not_available l'm used to it.
not_available Come on, let me get you out of here.
not_available We can still grab some dinner.
not_available No, l don't really feel like it.
not_available l think l'll go up top, grab some air.
not_available You want some company? Can l come over later? Maybe.
not_available l don't know, Div.
not_available l'll call you.
not_available So you and Doug were great today.
not_available What? The 1 2year
not_available old, boating accident.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Another 1 0 minutes, we would've lost him.
not_available l'll see you later.
not_available Hey.
not_available Come on in.
not_available Word came down from the O.R.
not_available The kid from the boating accident came through well.
not_available He'll be fine.
not_available That's great news.
not_available Pretty strange day, huh? You could say that.
not_available l could live the whole thing all over again.
not_available Doug, John asked me to move in with him.
not_available l thought l should tell you that l told him l would.
not_available Did you decide this this afternoon? We talked about it for a while.
not_available But did you decide to tell him today? 
not_available lt doesn't matter.
not_available What happened with us this afternoon, does that matter? What happened was an accident.
not_available There are no accidents.
not_available Look, it's great.
not_available Really, it's great.
not_available Thanks for letting me know.
not_available l can't find anybody to drink this with me.
not_available l don't know that l'm the best candidate.
not_available You are the only one with a birthday.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available However, you're not the only one with a crazy family.
not_available My dad says you should never, ever do this with a bottle of champagne.
not_available Now, if that's not crazy.
not_available Are you ready? l don't think so, but okay.
not_available Here.
not_available Thanks.
not_available You know, Carter, this is a whole side of you l've never seen before.
not_available What do you mean? l come up here a lot.
not_available You do? lf you were Dr.
not_available Benton's student, you'd come up here a lot too.
not_available However, today was an excellent day.
not_available l performed my first lumbar puncture.
not_available How was it? 
not_available Really scary.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene talked me through it.
not_available The patient did have meningitis.
not_available Now he'll be okay.
not_available l guess that's worth a scare.
not_available You know, you can call us by our first names.
not_available You call me Carter.
not_available Yeah, well, that's different somehow.
not_available So your sister, she's really stuck on this guy with the greasy hair? l doubt she knows his last name.
not_available Why? l was gonna ask her out.
not_available Who are you? l'm just kidding Susan.
not_available l get it John.
not_available No, it doesn't sound right.
not_available Okay.
not_available Call me Carter.

not_available Double
not_available glove time.
not_available So is this the perp? His name is Royden B.
not_available l thought you'd want to check him for rabies.
not_available The only way that Royden B.
not_available could have rabies is if he's been bitten by a wild animal.
not_available Given his lifestyle, that's unlikely.
not_available That finger's infected, probably because Lucy's been sucking on it.
not_available We'll clean it, give her antibiotics, and your daughter'll be fine.
not_available Niece.
not_available Niece, sorry.
not_available There was a family resemblance.
not_available You go to the Fifth Street Gym? No.

not_available That was more than an invitation to basketball.
not_available l know.
not_available l've been invited to basketball games.
not_available So what? 
not_available So l want an explanation.
not_available Mark, grow up.
not_available Does this mean you and Linda are serious? Serious? Our longest phone conversation is ''Get over here.'' Yeah.
not_available So what happened in there? 
not_available l've been summoned.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available lt'll be fine.
not_available l'm just curious how you can turn down guaranteed sex with an undeniably attractive woman.
not_available lf that's all there is, l'd rather play tennis.
not_available This is very disappointing coming from you.
not_available Nine times l've been stuck.
not_available Never even caught the flu.
not_available l've been lucky so far.
not_available This makes 5 for me.

not_available Here, sit right here.
not_available What's your name? 
not_available Jorge.
not_available He doesn't speak English.
not_available He's been retaining the evidence for 8 days.
not_available Eight days? Sounds like one for the Guinness Book of Records.
not_available Can't blame him for trying.
not_available He's facing 20 years.
not_available No obvious signs of toxicity.
not_available The condoms must still be intact.
not_available lf you can give him a laxative, it'd make my job easier.
not_available l can't give him any medication without his consent.
not_available Borrow a pen? We'll work him up, x
not_available ray him hope that nature takes its course before a condom breaks.
not_available Where'd you learn Spanish? Here.
not_available We work Benton's hours, sleep when he sleeps.

not_available Angiocath 1 6 needle if they're bleeding.
not_available You can start an lV? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available Actually, no.
not_available l thought you were third year.
not_available A body packer in four.
not_available Work him up.
not_available KUB, drug screen, urinalysis.

not_available This is your lucky day.

not_available He crashed.
not_available From bradycardic at 35 to flatline.
not_available Temp's 1 04.
not_available Blood cultures sent.

not_available Fifty milligrams, lV push.
not_available What's happening? 
not_available His heart is racing.
not_available Why?

not_available Move that.
not_available Move it.
not_available Draw petrillian.
not_available l told Kayson this kind of finger
not_available pointing runs contrary to the spirit of a teaching hospital.
not_available Juice? 
not_available No, thank you.
not_available He failed to see my point.
not_available He's bringing disciplinary charges.
not_available What does that mean, exactly? You'll come before the committee, defend yourself.
not_available We'll make a determination and take steps accordingly.
not_available Dr.
not_available Morgenstern, l tried to present Mr.
not_available Vennerbeck's history.
not_available Dr.
not_available Kayson cut me off and released him.
not_available The specifics don't concern me nearly as much as your inability to assert yourself.
not_available Excuse me? You allowed Kayson to intimidate you.
not_available Not the first time.
not_available l recall a similar incident with Benton about an appendix.
not_available l was right about that.
not_available But you deferred to Benton's judgment.
not_available You lack the authority to put forward your own opinions.
not_available To act as an aggressive advocate for your patients.
not_available l guess l have to work on that.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available Confidence.
not_available Composure under pressure.
not_available Assertiveness.
not_available These are the requisite qualities of a good ER specialist.
not_available l'll give you the chance to develop them.
not_available lf you don't, we'll have a discussion about which specialty might best match your temperament.
not_available Peaked T waves, unstable rhythm.
not_available Gotta be potassium, right? His lytes back? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available Can't wait.
not_available Give him calcium gluconate 1 5 mils.
not_available lt could kill him.
not_available Just do it.
not_available Asystole.
not_available All right, repeat epi and atropine.
not_available Doctor? 
not_available Your son's potassium is too high.
not_available Probably from renal failure.
not_available We'll try to bring it down.
not_available l got a pulse.
not_available Weak, but it's there.
not_available BP 35 palp.
not_available l'll take it.
not_available Lytes are back.

not_available l need to catch up.
not_available Don't tempt the Fates.
not_available You and Tag set a date yet? 
not_available Not yet.
not_available How'd it go? How'd it go? Well, it's hard to describe.
not_available Timmy, where's Petrofsky's chart? Why? What happened? lf l told you right now, l think l'd lose it.
not_available Go down to Exam Two.
not_available You live at the Marymount Home? 
not_available For the emotionally disabled.
not_available That's what society has labeled me.
not_available What's open? 
not_available Trauma.

not_available l can't.
not_available Why not? 
not_available lt's green.
not_available ls that bad? Very.
not_available He asleep? Yeah.
not_available l went and got a few of his things.
not_available Ben's pretty sick.
not_available He's got pneumonia which caused his heart problems earlier.
not_available l hope the antibiotics will help.
not_available Last time they put him on a ventilator.
not_available We may do that if his blood gases don't improve.
not_available When will you know? 
not_available We'll check in an hour or so.
not_available He likes rhythm.
not_available Before the accident, he was taking trumpet lessons.
not_available He used the metronome to practice.
not_available l don't think he remembers.
not_available Kid had a hell of a bat.
not_available Now if that picture isn't there when he wakes up, he gets this look.

not_available You got kids? l have a son.
not_available How old? 
not_available He's eight.
not_available That's a nice age.
not_available Okay, Deb.
not_available As we say around here quite often, ''Glove up and dig in.'' Carter, isn't that your job? Deb's gotta learn.
not_available Exactly what do l look for? Obstructions, masses, anything out of the ordinary.
not_available But l don't have anything to compare it to.
not_available You will soon.
not_available Mr.
not_available Jorge, could you turn on your side, please? Thank you.

not_available l want to run some tests, do a chest x
not_available ray.
not_available All right.
not_available Did you have red hair as a child? l thought l saw a touch of russet in your hair.

not_available You want to cover for him? Sure.
not_available You have to take over the scheduling, risk management, shift reports.
not_available No problem.
not_available lt'll be good training for when l'm chief surgical resident.
not_available That's what l like about you, naked ambition tempered by arrogance.
not_available You have an emergency call.
not_available Your brotherin
not_available law.
not_available l'm scrubbing in for surgery.
not_available He said your mother's missing.
not_available Go.

not_available My charts have your signature.
not_available Why? 
not_available Morgenstern told me to.
not_available You think you need to oversee my decisions? 
not_available No.
not_available You tell Morgenstern that? 
not_available He didn't ask my opinion.
not_available Why didn't you stand up for me? You seem to forget a patient died.
not_available Your patient.
not_available lt could've happened to any of us, but it happened to you.
not_available And now there's a lawsuit and an inquiry.
not_available And because l'm chief resident, it's my problem too.
not_available So if Morgenstern wants me to cosign your charts, l'm gonna do it.
not_available You knew what he was gonna say to me today, didn't you? 
not_available Yes.
not_available You talked about me.
not_available l talk with Morgenstern about every resident.
not_available What'd you say? 
not_available That Kayson gives you a hard time.
not_available And the way he rides you, it's no wonder this happened.
not_available And when you go headto
not_available head with guys like Benton and Kayson you tend to back down.
not_available Son of a bitch.
not_available Hey, Ben.
not_available How are you? l got it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross.
not_available Hey, Wendy, look who's up.
not_available O

not_available You better look at this.
not_available ''Do not resuscitate''? His father did this? Wendy, give Mr.

not_available No.
not_available Have Ubaldo's T cells come back? 
not_available No.
not_available Lab's backed up.

not_available What's wrong with him? Who cares? Carol, can you get a chart going?

not_available Questioned her sexual orientation.
not_available Well, that's rude.
not_available No malice intended.
not_available Did she do this? 
not_available Newsstand guy.
not_available What'd you say to him? Derogatory comments about his heritage.
not_available Didn't take much.
not_available lnjuries anywhere else? 
not_available Think l've got a cracked rib.
not_available Newsstand guy? Florist in Wicker Park, sensitive about his hairweave.
not_available Malik, give me a hand.
not_available Take him to the Suture Room.
not_available What do you do? Go around insulting people until they hit you? l'm a sociologist at Chicago, specializing in violence.
not_available l select a subject, ask two questions to probe for insecurities then l antagonize them until they assault me.
not_available Sounds dangerous.
not_available Tell me about it.
not_available My insurance company charges me the same premiums as NASCAR drivers.
not_available We'll move him to lntensive Care soon.
not_available l see you made a decision.
not_available Mr.
not_available Gaither, Ben's blood gases are not good.
not_available He's not getting enough oxygen.
not_available lf he's not ventilated, he could die.
not_available When? lt could be a matter of hours.
not_available With the proper care he could live a long time.
not_available Are you sure that you want to give up? l can't believe Mrs.
not_available Lukey.
not_available She's too senile to do the job.
not_available Myatt's kid may have seen your mom down at the corner.
not_available She waited two hours to call us.
not_available Not us.
not_available Me.
not_available She made me look like an idiot
not_available Look, Peter.
not_available l left a station full of cars that need service.
not_available All because you had to hire some old woman to take care of your mom 
not_available instead of putting her in a home.
not_available She's not doing that.
not_available Like hell she isn't.
not_available Walt, don't tell me what to do.
not_available l won't let you put us through this anymore.
not_available l'm sorry if it makes you sad, but there's no choice.
not_available She's my mother.
not_available Who are you to tell me
not_available l paid for her food, her clothes and her care for the last six years.
not_available She lets you live in her house.
not_available Who pays the damn mortgage? Who pays the bills? You don't get anything out of it? How many highschool dropouts do you know have a $ 1 00,000 business just dropped in their laps? High
not_available school dropout? l cared for your family for six years.
not_available l carried your family for six years.
not_available l'm responsible for your mother, your sister, the house and the station.
not_available The only one that Peter is responsible for is Peter.
not_available l'm gonna look by the firehouse.
not_available Okay, Mr.
not_available Desmond, l'm going to clean your abrasions.
not_available We'll start with your wrist.
not_available lt may sting a little.
not_available That's a big engagement ring.
not_available lsn't it? Kind of ostentatious, don't you think? No, l don't.
not_available Can l ask you two questions? All right.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available What does your fiancé do? 
not_available He's a doctor.
not_available So, gonna be a doctor's wife.
not_available When's the date? We haven't set one yet.
not_available Why not? Your two questions are up.
not_available What's the matter? Somebody can't commit? Based on the ring, l don't think it's him.
not_available So what is it? Think you're too good for him? Scared of spending your life with someone who doesn't meet your standards? Got a high opinion of yourself, don't you? ''Sure, l'll marry you.
not_available Just don't tie me down to a date.'' That stings! Really? 
not_available Yes, it does.
not_available God! Twenty
not_available one second PAl puts you in the top percentile on the hostility index.
not_available PAl is? Provocationto
not_available assault interval.
not_available You're good.

not_available Alan, the guy with the colors? His films came back.
not_available Radiology had a bunch from a few years ago too.
not_available Susan? l can stay in this room all day.
not_available lt's warm, like flannel.
not_available l wish l could wear it.
not_available When you gave me your history, you didn't say you had cancer.
not_available What's nice about this room is that it's not too bright.
not_available When yellow's too bright, it's not welcoming.
not_available Alan, you have a tumor in your chest encasing your heart and infiltrating your lungs.
not_available On the other hand if yellow's too pale, it feels cold and clammy.
not_available There are 
treatments Chemotherapy, radiation.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis and l think you should see an oncologist.
not_available l'll tell you one 
thing Whoever made this room sure knew his yellow.
not_available Could l be alone, please? Sure.
not_available Ma? Ma, what are you doing up here? Who is that? Peter? 
not_available Yeah, Ma, it's me.
not_available Aren't you supposed to be in school? Ma, l work at a hospital, remember? l'm a doctor.
not_available l know that.
not_available Why do l feel l don't get a chance to see you? Well, because they keep us pretty busy.
not_available But we see each other sometimes.
not_available So serious.
not_available l remember you sitting in that green chair by the window reading your books.
not_available So serious.
not_available You know, Ma with Jackie at work all day and the kids at school we worry about you being alone.
not_available Oh, l don't like it that way either.
not_available l like a full house.
not_available Well, that's why we were thinking maybe you'd be happier in a place where, you know, there's.
not_available Where there's other people your age, people that can take care of you.
not_available l used to bring Jackie to take skating lessons right here.
not_available And your father and l watched you in the Little League right on this field.

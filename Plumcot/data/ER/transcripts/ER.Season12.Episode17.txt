not_available You ever been to a baptism? Yes, I have.
not_available I thought it was weird.

not_available American Academy of Obstetrics says
not_available Please.
not_available Stop changing the subject.

not_available My day pretty much sucked.
not_available Yeah? I pretty much lost it in a code this morning.
not_available Isn't it funny that one minute your whole life everything is in order and then wham splitsecond event and the whole thing just starts to spin around? I know exactly what you're talking about
not_available People at work, I mean, they see this sliver of what you're about and make it all about that one thing.
not_available I know.
not_available They jump to all sorts of conclusions
not_available They don't know what I'm going through.
not_available They're making all these assumptions, but they only see what they wanna see.
not_available Why must men always resort to violence to settle their differences? My son idolizes his sister, but he's never liked this boyfriend of hers.

not_available Is he coming in? He died when Nimet was 5.
not_available He was a reporter for the newspaper.
not_available Kidnapped and shot by the Turkish Hezbollah while I was pregnant with Mahir.
not_available I had to leave.

not_available Very.
not_available And wait Now, why aren't you on it? That's weird.
not_available Too bad.
not_available Ha, ha.
not_available Timothy Weisner.
not_available There's always one ass in the audience determined to look smarter than you.
not_available He's that guy.
not_available You have his paper, right? He's gonna ask you about it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Yeah, not enough love in the sandbox needs to hear his own work cited in other people's talks.
not_available What? Relax, you'll be fine.
not_available I, uh, played a tangerine in a Christmas play in primary school.
not_available Lost my footing and rolled off the stage.
not_available I'm having flashbacks.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available Just relax.
not_available Read your slides, don't go too fast, and Well, memorize table three of the Weisner paper and you'll do just fine.
not_available Oh, I brought you this.

not_available It's a beta
not_available blocker.
not_available It's okay.

not_available I gotta be me, man.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Neela wants you to go to her locker and find the Weisner paper in the February 2005 issue of Trauma Annals and fax it to her at this number.
not_available She said you'd know what it's about.
not_available I do, and I do.
not_available She said if you do this, she'll watch any '70s movie you want even the extended version of Dawn of the Dead.
not_available And this came back on your overdose.
not_available You're sure this is right? 
not_available I even had them repeat it.
not_available How you feeling, Mr.
not_available Sadler? 
not_available About the same.
not_available But I suppose I won't feel much till most of the liver dies.
not_available That's not gonna happen.
not_available Your acetaminophen level is almost undetectable.
not_available That's strange.
not_available I know that's what I took.
not_available Could there have been anything else in the bottle? No.
not_available But, uh, that doesn't change the course of action.
not_available You still have to keep me on a hold.
not_available At least until Psychiatry sees you, yeah.
not_available Yeah, that makes sense.
not_available So, what happened in there? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available That wasn't nothing.
not_available She shouldn't be with someone like that.
not_available He seems like an okay guy to me.
not_available He's a jerk.
not_available He lives in Dorch it's the jock dorm.
not_available Something bad happened there last term.
not_available What do you mean something bad? A girl got gang
not_available raped.

not_available They never figured out who did it.
not_available And you think Frick was involved? They all knew what was going on.
not_available I'll be right back.
not_available Where's the boyfriend? Uh, staying away for now, out of respect for the family.
not_available Her brother doesn't think he's such a good guy.
not_available Well, I'm sure the police are investigating all possibilities.
not_available The phone call before? Oh, it's nothing.
not_available Uh, Surgery's still tied up? Yeah.
not_available Anything I can do?

not_available Sam, call the perfusion team.
not_available What? 
not_available Heart rate's dropping.
not_available What does that mean? Putting her on a cardio
not_available pulmonary bypass.
not_available You need an O.R.
not_available and a surgeon.
not_available We don't have either.
not_available We're gonna cannulate, we'll bypass.
not_available You can't do that.
not_available If we work quick, we'll get her on before she suffers permanent hypoxic damage.
not_available Get a Resident.
not_available I'll find Abby.
not_available Tell me what's happening.
not_available The bleeding is blocking her airway.
not_available We can't get oxygen into her blood.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available We'll get her on a heartlung machine so we can buy more time before we can get her into an O.R., okay? 
not_available Whatever you think is right.
not_available Brady to 45, lost the pulse.
not_available Starting compressions.
not_available Mahir, you should wait outside.
not_available Mom.
not_available Go.
not_available Nimet.
not_available Nimet, you're a strong girl.
not_available You're a brave girl.

not_available Okay, what's this about, kids? I'm a doctor, very busy.
not_available You're Archibald Morris.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What do you need? You better have a seat.
not_available Here's the deal.
not_available We four live with different parents, but we all share the same dad.
not_available We're not supposed to be able to find out the identity of our father.
not_available But the Donor Sibling Registry allows us to find out the identity of each other.
not_available So I got in contact with them via e
not_available mail.
not_available And it actually turns out that little Max here is actually a computer genius.
not_available What's up? 
not_available What's up? He hacked the system at the sperm bank and found our father's name.
not_available Archibald Morris.
not_available So are you donor 140 from the Chicago CryoBank? Did you donate any sperm between 1991 and 1996? Ha.
not_available Did I ever.
not_available Heh.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available I'm
not_available I'm your daddy.
not_available Mr.
not_available Sadler.
not_available Being a sitter for crazy people seems like a really boring job.
not_available Well, guess what, Barry.
not_available You and the sitter can both go home.
not_available What? You convinced the psychiatrist it's safe to discharge you.
not_available No.
not_available You're free to go.
not_available Well, what about these? Mr.
not_available Sadler, you took what? Three, maybe four pills? 
not_available Two.
not_available Two.
not_available Yeah, but a gesture is a gesture.
not_available I was suicidal when I did it.
not_available The psychiatrist is convinced you're not gonna try it again.
not_available What if I'm homicidal? You have to keep me if I wanna kill people.
not_available Barry, ha, what's going on? The thing is I, uh
not_available I need to stay here.
not_available I can't go home this weekend.
not_available Why not? 
not_available I just can't.
not_available You're gonna have to do better than that.
not_available I'm in love with my best friend's girl.
not_available Ha.
not_available It happens.
not_available You'll get over it.
not_available They're getting married tomorrow.
not_available I don't trust myself not to To what? 
not_available Object.
not_available Or worse.
not_available Lock me up till the wedding's over, please.
not_available I'm begging you.
not_available I'll talk to Psych again, see what I can do.

not_available Who? Helen? Yeah.
not_available Have you told her how you feel? God, no.
not_available That would be crazy.

not_available It's okay, Nimet.
not_available It's gonna be all right.
not_available Got a flash.

not_available Nope.
not_available All right, give us some room.
not_available Come on.
not_available I'll be right here.
not_available Just listen to my voice.
not_available It seems a little unconventional.
not_available Okay.
not_available Fine, what's the alternative? 
not_available Somebody call Surgery again.
not_available Still working in an open chest five minutes ago.
not_available Did I tell you Mrs.
not_available Kalter's daughter has 14 bridesmaids in her wedding? We'll oxygenate her blood till Surgery's ready.
not_available It'll be awesome.
not_available If she doesn't bleed out.
not_available Threading easily.
not_available Nine yards of silk organza.
not_available Hook me up, Lockhart.
not_available Does Surgery know we're doing this? 
not_available They're not available.
not_available We can't wait.
not_available Silk flowers all around their neck.
not_available You must get better so you can help me with the embroidery.

not_available Ha, ha! Sat's coming up.
not_available Ninety
not_available two.
not_available Is it working? Her oxygen level is improving, yes.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you for saving my daughter.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Up to 15 percent of all deaths following motor vehicle collisions are caused by injury to the thoracic aorta.
not_available IUh We set out to document the incidence and utility of the seatbelt sign in predicting Is there anyone from audio
not_available visual support here? Unseen they suffer.
not_available Unheard they cry.
not_available In agony they linger.
not_available Alone they die.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available I would like to point out 
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available that our study didn't involve any rats.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Rats have rights.
not_available Ray, meet my kids.
not_available Your what? Yeah, I needed cash in college, donated to a sperm bank.
not_available Best job I ever had.

not_available Stole her mom's car, drove to get everybody here.
not_available Michael is the regional "Dance Dance Revolution" champion.
not_available Melia is a professional jump roper, and my boy Max is a computer whiz.

not_available Uh, these, uh, are the trauma rooms, okay? 
not_available This is where Daddy saves lives.
not_available Cool.
not_available Abby, come meet my children.
not_available Not now, Morris.
not_available Okay, she hates kids.
not_available How's she doing? 
not_available Stable for now.
not_available Where'd the family go? 
not_available I made them get something to eat.
not_available It's gonna be a long night.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Uh, okay, I kind of snapped this morning.
not_available It's okay.
not_available It's hormones.
not_available No, I hate that excuse.
not_available I just I just wanna say that I know you were trying to help, and I apologize.
not_available Apology accepted.
not_available It's just strange being pregnant.
not_available It's so weird having such a personal thing be so public.
not_available Well, for me, being pregnant was something everyone was ashamed of.
not_available My parents didn't want me to leave the house.
not_available I think it's nice that everybody wants to share in this with you.
not_available Luka.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Tell us what's happening.
not_available Seventh unit, platelets, FFP going up.
not_available Wide open at the femoral.
not_available Somebody explain.
not_available What has gone wrong? Heparin's off, right? Heparin's off? 
not_available It's off.
not_available Okay, one gram of protamine.
not_available Please, you have to help her.
not_available Can't get her mean above 30.
not_available She's losing blood faster than we can put in.
not_available In order to put Nimet on this machine we had to give her a medicine that thins her blood.
not_available A side effect is internal bleeding.
not_available That might be what's happening now.
not_available If you stop the medicine, she'll be okay? 
not_available That's what we're hoping, yes.
not_available Whoa, acidotic, 6.8.
not_available Try one amp of bicarb and one gram of calcium.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Go, go, go.
not_available Pupils are fixed and dilated.
not_available No corneal, no gag.
not_available Why? There's no head trauma, and no reason for a spontaneous bleed.
not_available Heparin
not_available induced thrombocytopenia can cause acute intracranial hemorrhage.
not_available She's been on heparin for less than an hour.
not_available It doesn't make sense.
not_available Does it make sense? Check the oxygenator.
not_available Get another ACT.
not_available Volume's too low.
not_available No flow.
not_available She's lost some basic neurologic reflexes.
not_available What does that mean? 
not_available We think that she's bled into her brain.
not_available Stop it, Mahir.
not_available I can't hear the doctors.
not_available Can you fix this? No, we can't.
not_available Her brain is gone and as soon as we turn the machine off, her body's gonna die too.
not_available Come back.
not_available Nimet is strong, she can fight.
not_available Stop, Mahir.
not_available Stop right now! This never would've happened if she stayed at home! 
not_available You should have made her stay.
not_available Enough! Please! There must be another machine or something! I'm sorry.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I'll give my own blood.
not_available It was a good idea, Vic.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah, if it had worked, right? You gave her the only chance she ever had.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I'm sorry about the beta
not_available blocker.
not_available Ten milligrams was probably a bit much.
not_available The fainting part just makes for a better story.
not_available You know I once ate a hash brownie before giving a big talk in Amsterdam.
not_available I mistakenly thought that it would take an hour to kick in.
not_available Suddenly, I was up on a stage, completely out of my head lecturing to a roomful of biochemists in a faux French accent.
not_available Okay.
not_available I feel better.
not_available Today was a complete disaster, but at least I didn't bring it on myself.
not_available No, no, no.
not_available You were the victim of a truly astounding confluence of technical problems miscalculated pharmaceuticals, and rat activists.
not_available As crazy as that sounds, that's totally in sync with my life at the moment.
not_available Well, your life sounds pretty interesting.
not_available Oh, no.
not_available I know I may appear to be this kind of wild spontaneous girl who plans a wedding in a day and sits here getting drunk with her Attending in a hotel bar.
not_available But I'm not.
not_available I'm boring, really boring.
not_available All I wanna do is hang out at home with my roommate.
not_available Your roommate? Dr.
not_available Barnett? 
not_available Yeah, Ray.
not_available Well, that's nice.
not_available It's good the two of you get along so well.
not_available Yeah, we do.
not_available Maybe that's what I need.
not_available You know, I was thinking of getting a dog but a roommate's probably easier to housetrain.
not_available Are you ready for another round? Uh, no.
not_available No.
not_available Thank you, I, uh I should get going.
not_available It was worth a try.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I need to go over organ donation and explain about the coroner.
not_available I don't wanna rush her.
not_available No, of course not.
not_available This might take a while.
not_available Maybe you should go home.
not_available Don't wait for me.
not_available I've been thinking, and if it's that important to your family I'm fine with the baptism.
not_available A little holy water never hurt anybody, right? Well, Archie, this was fun.
not_available I'm glad we came.
not_available Wait.
not_available You're not leaving, are you? I was gonna take you all out for burgers and shakes.
not_available Sorry, can't.
not_available I gotta get everyone home before 8 or our parents will start to worry.
not_available Well
not_available I mean, what's next? Now, I wanna take you guys to ball games, Millennium Park movies your parents won't let you see, there's so much.
not_available Perhaps.
not_available Um, we're all pretty busy.
not_available I don't know when I'll be able to steal my mom's car again, so Somebody hid the digital on the code cart.
not_available Oh, great.
not_available Frank, thank you.
not_available I wanna take a picture.
not_available Really, we gotta run.
not_available Please, two seconds.
not_available Come on, please.
not_available Okay, everybody say freak.
not_available Samantha.
not_available Hey.
not_available I'm glad you called.
not_available Where's all your stuff? Oh, I thought we were gonna conduct an interview first.
not_available I thought we already did.
not_available Hey, how was it? 
not_available Endless.
not_available Well, I'm making a stir
not_available fry.
not_available Beer or wine? Neither.
not_available I'm exhausted and already drunk.
not_available All right.
not_available Here.
not_available Taste this.
not_available Fresh water chestnut.
not_available Crazy, huh? Thought they grew in cans.
not_available All right, well, I rented The Omen, and I was too scared to watch it alone.
not_available Ray
not_available It's better than The Exorcist.
not_available I promise it's a classic.
not_available That's what you said about The Exorcist.
not_available True, but
not_available Ray.
not_available I know, you're tired.
not_available Ray.
not_available Okay, look.
not_available I know you don't like devil movies.
not_available It's the last one, I promise.
not_available I think I should move out.
not_available Why? 
not_available I think we both know why.
not_available Where's Mahir? I don't know.
not_available I'm afraid for him.
not_available He just needs some time.
not_available I'm sorry to bother you with this but, uh, you need to sign for her things.
not_available This is the hardest thing for any parent to experience.
not_available How do you protect them from all the evil in the world? You can't.
not_available No matter what you do, you can't.
not_available Mahir was beaten up at school after 9/11 for being Muslim.
not_available They called him a terrorist.
not_available Ever since then, he became very strict about his prayers.
not_available He cut himself off from everything except his fundamentalist friends.
not_available He wanted the same thing for his sister.
not_available There's a park down the street where we live.
not_available I close my eyes, and they're just little children on the swings.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available It's all right.
not_available It's all right.
not_available I brought them to this country to find justice and freedom.
not_available But I lose two children today.
not_available Two children.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Mahir
not_available Mahir will be all right.
not_available I can't pretend that I don't know what I know in my heart.
not_available He loved his sister.
not_available But he thought she was disgracing the family, disgracing herself.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Doctor, doctor, doctor.
not_available Doctor, tell the police to search my house first.
not_available They should look into Mahir's room for the knife.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available This was an honor killing? Yes.
not_available Yes.
not_available That's what they call it.
not_available But there is no honor here.
not_available What the hell are you still doing here, man? Downloading the picture of my kids from the ER camera.
not_available Really photogenic, aren't they, huh? I'm gonna use this one for my Christmas card.
not_available I don't know.
not_available I hate Christmas cards, man.
not_available Hey, you wanna go grab some dinner together? Uh, no.
not_available My oldest boy, Michael, DJs an online radio show.
not_available I wanna check it out.
not_available Why don't we listen to it here? No, I can't.
not_available After that I gotta brush up on my trig so I can help Melia with her homework.
not_available She's 10 years old, she's smarter at math than I am, huh? Family really keeps you busy, huh? 
not_available Yeah, but it's worth it though, right? So you, uh, heading home? I heard your apartment got pretty messed up.
not_available No, it's fixed.
not_available I mean, that's finally what it took the landlord to paint it.
not_available Okay, then.
not_available Cool.
not_available Welcome back, Vic.
not_available You have a good night.
not_available You too, man.

not_available complaining of abdominal pain.
not_available Where's his chart? 
not_available ln the rack.
not_available At the desk.
not_available Carter, go get his chart.
not_available l'll need a CBC, Chem
not_available 7, coag panel and drop a nasogastric tube.
not_available You gonna write this down? l'm not comfortable taking verbal orders.
not_available l think you better write everything down for us.
not_available Us? 
not_available The nurses.
not_available Here's his chart.
not_available Start writing.
not_available Grace we've added fentanyl to the morphine.
not_available See if that helps.
not_available lf it doesn't work, we have three choices.
not_available We can insert a catheter into your spinal cord to deliver the morphine.
not_available Or we can surgically cut the spinal tracts that carry the pain from your legs and back.
not_available Or we can increase your morphine but your dosage is so high it might depress your breathing.
not_available Can you stop this pain? l'm not sure.
not_available We're trying.
not_available Try harder.
not_available Resps? 
not_available Fourteen.
not_available Let me know if her breathing gets any worse.
not_available Don't even ask.
not_available Mark, keep me company.
not_available Good call on that pulmonary embolism.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Oncology found a small polyp.
not_available lf he hadn't tossed a clot who knows how far that would've gone before rearing its ugly head.
not_available What's all this? 
not_available Some kind of tree snake got loose.
not_available Really? l was impressed about your concern for the students.
not_available Making sure they were involved and learning.
not_available You're a fine teacher.
not_available Given any thought as to what you'll do next year? Start repaying med school loans.
not_available Sent a few letters but l haven't started.
not_available Why don't you think about joining the staff here? As an attending? You won't make as much money as the cowboys at private hospitals but there are other rewards, ephemeral as they may be.
not_available Well, think about it anyway.
not_available No, l'd be honored.
not_available Really.
not_available Here's my bus.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available You earned it.
not_available to the leg and abdomen.

not_available O
not_available neg.
not_available Let's move.
not_available Grab me that dynamap.
not_available That lV infiltrated? Hang the blood Y
not_available tubing.
not_available Ready, lift.
not_available Get an H and H.
not_available l don't get a pulse.
not_available He's still breathing.
not_available Tried to apply pressure but he was a sieve.
not_available Name's Yummy Jackson.
not_available Driveby? 
not_available Drug deal gone bad.
not_available Gang thing.
not_available At 1 2 years old? Kid had a Tech
not_available 9 and a Ruger on him when we found him.
not_available Trauma 1 , get in here now! 
not_available Watch that line.
not_available She's still in a lot of pain.
not_available Okay.
not_available l'm sorry the fentanyl isn't helping much.
not_available lt's helping a little.
not_available Can we do anything to make you more comfortable? You can shoot me.
not_available l'm sorry, l didn't bring my gun to work today.
not_available l don't think it's safe to up the morphine any higher.
not_available Afraid it'll kill me? lt might.
not_available There's not a lot more that the ER can do to help you.
not_available Do you want me to admit you to the hospital? Can l go back to the hospice? Yes, but they're gonna need to bring you back here for a higher dosage.
not_available Can l take a little while to decide? Sure.
not_available Can l help you? Excuse me, can l help you? You can't be back here.
not_available You must go now.
not_available Oh, my God.
not_available Son of a bitch! 
not_available Get out the way.
not_available You're too late.
not_available He's already dead.
not_available lt's madness.
not_available You can clearly see the posterior dislocation of the knee consistent with this sledding injury which occurred when the impact applied direct force to the anterior tibia while the knee was flexed.
not_available lnjury to the.
not_available l'm really nervous.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available l picked too easy a topic.
not_available Relax.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton doesn't expect that much.
not_available lt's your first rotation.
not_available with horizontal traction and realignment of the joint.
not_available Angiography should be considered with attention paid to the five P'
s Pain, pallor, paresthesias pulselessness and paralysis.
not_available All right.
not_available Who's next? Carter.
not_available While attempting a Rollerblading maneuver this 1 2yearold male fell on his outstretched right hand resulting in a Salter
not_available Harris type ll epiphyseal fracture of the proximal humerus.
not_available To avoid damage to the growth plate, the humeral head, in angulation and external rotation, must be reduced by abducting and externally rotating the arm and then slowly bringing the arm down.
not_available lf the reduction is not accomplished, the arm must be maintained in a cast in the Statue of Liberty position.
not_available ls that it? Any questions? Ms.
not_available Chen.
not_available You'll do great.
not_available Here.
not_available Facial fractures.
not_available You'll find an outline and recent research articles.
not_available Would you pass it down? Here we see examples of a depressed fracture of the left frontal bone with disruption to the orbital rim.
not_available Both the result of blunt
not_available force trauma when the patient's face intercepted a tire iron.
not_available John, if you would, please? The projector.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Orbital rim and frontal sinus fractures along with other fractures to these facial bones often result in concomitant CNS injury.
not_available Diagnosis is established with radiographic studies and computerized tomography, preferably using a three
not_available dimensional image of the patient's skull.
not_available As you can see, the frontal sinus and orbital rim fractures here are easily appreciated.
not_available How's her breathing? Depressed but okay.
not_available She's finally out.
not_available Maybe we got the balance right, and she can get some sleep.
not_available Kathy.
not_available Who's Kathy? 
not_available Her little girl.
not_available Does she know she's here? She lives out West somewhere with Grace's ex
not_available husband.
not_available Seattle, l think.
not_available Grace gave up custody when she entered the hospice.
not_available She lost her child? She entered the hospice to die.
not_available Life goes on.
not_available Then again, sometimes it doesn't.
not_available Old hospice joke.
not_available Oh, God! Oh, God! 
not_available God, it hurts.
not_available The fentanyl's wearing off.
not_available Lie down.
not_available Lie down.
not_available lt hurts.
not_available Her resps are too low, l can't give her any more morphine.
not_available l can't stand it.
not_available l can't stand it.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available l'm so sorry.
not_available lt hurts so much, doctor.
not_available There's nothing else l can do.
not_available Please kill me.

not_available You gotta wait in the waiting room.
not_available Will he be okay? 
not_available We don't know yet.
not_available Malik! Can you take them to Waiting? 
not_available ln a minute.
not_available We're gonna do everything we can, okay? Okay, get the ambu
not_available bag.
not_available Lost his pulse.
not_available He's in fib.
not_available Crash cart.
not_available Turn off the O

not_available Where's the cart? 
not_available Here.
not_available No.
not_available Where's the new cart? Watch that line.

not_available l put one in here an hour ago.
not_available Carol, 200.
not_available Somebody already stole my new cart! 
not_available Clear! ls Jake around? He went to get a soda.
not_available Nice digs.
not_available This is how the other half lives? l could do with a little less glass, actually.
not_available There's no blood on the carpet, so it's a step up from the ER.
not_available Mind if l sit? l've had my shots.
not_available Cindy was right.
not_available You are kind of charming.
not_available ls that bad? Depends.
not_available Jake's a great kid.
not_available He is a great kid.
not_available l hope you don't mind if we shoot hoops now and then.
not_available l won't pass along any misogyny with the basketball tips.
not_available lf misogyny's genetic, he's inherited plenty from his father.
not_available Does he see his dad much? 
not_available They communicate by check when it comes.
not_available lf you don't like me, you don't have to hide it.
not_available You can just come out and show it.
not_available l didn't know l was being subtle.
not_available Hey, yourself! Dr.
not_available Ross came to see if you wanna play basketball.

not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available What does this say? 
not_available NG tube.
not_available By that you mean a nasogastric tube? 
not_available Yes.
not_available And this? 
not_available Dextrose 5, normal saline.
not_available An lV? Yes, an lV.
not_available Well, l've examined the patient.
not_available And l believe she needs a fine, surgical hand like yours to get an lV going properly.
not_available l'll have Carter do it.
not_available And the nasogastric tube? You'll notice she has a deviated septum and l don't feel comfortable putting one in.
not_available l'll do it myself.
not_available Tell the lab his coag panel's cooking.
not_available Here are his chest films.
not_available lf you can find those hockey kids, tell them he's gonna be okay.
not_available Susan? Susan.
not_available Susan, come on.
not_available l'm busy, Mark.
not_available l need to talk to you about a patient.
not_available Endstage breast cancer, bone
not_available Mets to her back and legs.
not_available Morphine's not working.
not_available Neither's the fentanyl.
not_available She's in agony.
not_available There's nothing l can do to help her.
not_available Spinal morphine therapy, cordotomy? She refused both of them.
not_available She just wants to die.
not_available Well, it sounds like she's going to, soon.
not_available She wants me to help her.
not_available Her resps are down to 1 2.
not_available lf l give her a little more morphine, her breathing will stop.
not_available What would you do? l don't know.
not_available l gotta go.
not_available How long are you gonna keep this up? 
not_available You weren't there for me.
not_available lt was professional, not personal.
not_available We're not married, we work together.
not_available Professional is personal.
not_available l miss you.
not_available You could have told me you were doing facial fractures.
not_available And that computer thing.
not_available l looked stupid.
not_available No, no.
not_available Keep irrigating that.
not_available l can give you the graphics program.
not_available lt's easy to use.
not_available That's not the point.
not_available l need a good recommendation from Benton if l'm gonna get a surgical residency.
not_available Vertical mattress, 4
not_available 0 nylon.
not_available You're going into surgery? Yeah.
not_available Why do you say it like that? No.
not_available l mean, l think you'd be great.

not_available You just sounded surprised.
not_available You really wanna go into surgery? l don't know.
not_available l might.
not_available Well, look, John, l've seen my mother's surgical residents and the ones around here, and it just doesn't seem like you.
not_available What do you mean, your mother's residents? Your mother's a surgical attending? She's chief of surgery.
not_available Could l get more four by four's? Chief of surgery? Where? What hospital? St.
not_available Bart's.
not_available Why even come to school? You won't have trouble getting a residency.
not_available lt's not like that.
not_available She won't help me at all.
not_available She didn't even want me to go into medicine.
not_available Just don't say anything to anyone.
not_available They jump to conclusions and l end up having to prove myself all over again.
not_available Okay? Please? l found the snake.
not_available Billy.
not_available Billy don't please.

not_available What do we do? Sheri Dunphy? Not a problem.
not_available Sheri? Doug, hi.
not_available How've you been? Good.
not_available You look great.
not_available You lost some weight.
not_available l got married last year, remember? 
not_available l'm still in mourning.

not_available l'm out of here.
not_available l got a patient.
not_available A 6year
not_available old, tetrology of fallot.
not_available Yeah, okay.
not_available All right.
not_available He's unbelievable.
not_available That's why l slept with him on the first date.
not_available First date? No kidding.
not_available He rang the doorbell and we were on the kitchen floor.
not_available Kitchen floor? Jeez, l gotta start dating again.
not_available Kids are having fun.
not_available Yeah.
not_available They're the hockey players from my Ml.
not_available Haven't been picked up yet.
not_available How'd he do? He's not dead, if that's what you mean.
not_available No that's not what l meant.
not_available He's gonna be fine.
not_available How is she? She died a couple minutes ago.
not_available Respiratory failure? l was listening to those kids playing and watching the snow fall.
not_available You know, if you stand right here
not_available Right over here you can see the El from here.
not_available Faces looking out the windows into the darkness.
not_available Life goes on, Mark.
not_available Do you wanna get something to eat? l can't.
not_available Jennifer and Rachel are in town.
not_available Another time, maybe.
not_available Susan.
not_available Thanks.
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available Stop now.
not_available Stop! Where are their parents? 
not_available l'm having problems with Haleh.
not_available So l heard.
not_available Reschedule her so we don't have to work together.
not_available You're the one who needs to be rescheduled.
not_available You won't do it? No.
not_available The nursing schedule is my prerogative.
not_available Even if that situation endangers patient care? You work every day and every third night.
not_available She's got four kids.
not_available When is she supposed to work? 
not_available She refuses to follow my instructions.
not_available Why should she? You're in training.
not_available She graduated.
not_available Don't give me that.
not_available We are not equals.
not_available She may not know how to cross
not_available clamp an aorta but she's worked in emergency for 20 years.
not_available lf you'd ever hop off that pedestal you're on you might see that the nurses make this place work, not you.
not_available l smell food.
not_available l'm actually cooking.
not_available Like, from scratch and everything? Yeah, who knows? lt might become an annual tradition.
not_available l don't know.
not_available l remember you cooking something last summer.
not_available l think it was meatloaf, maybe.
not_available lt was definitely brown.
not_available Semiannual, then.
not_available When did you get home? 
not_available Seven or so.
not_available The traffic was awful.
not_available Where's Rach? She's in the bathtub.
not_available God, what a week! l'm exhausted.
not_available How was your day? 
not_available Great and awful.
not_available Tell me great.
not_available l'm too tired for awful.
not_available Morgenstern offered me a job as attending physician next year.
not_available What'd you say? 
not_available l said yes.
not_available Without discussing it with me first? An attending.
not_available l figured l'd be spending nights and weekends at some community hospital in Winnetka.
not_available ls this a problem? Can you tell him you need time to think about it? l don't need to think about it.
not_available This is a great opportunity! l won't know until March if Judge Franklin needs me to clerk next year.
not_available You're considering spending another year in Milwaukee? lf he wants me to, yes.
not_available But l assumed
not_available Exactly! You assume things would be the way you want.
not_available The last six months haven't exactly been the way l want them
not_available l've been living by myself, without my wife, without my daughter.
not_available ''My wife, my daughter'' ! lt's only been six months.
not_available What about the last six years? What about medical school, rotations and residency? Who was a paralegal so we had food? Who was in night school for years, finishing college? Was that you? No, that was me.
not_available So now l want it to be about me for a change, not you.
not_available How are you doing, Mr.
not_available Conally? You still dead? Oh, yeah, very.
not_available My head feels better, though.
not_available Well, that's good.
not_available You just let us know if we can get you anything else, okay? Night.
not_available Good night.
not_available You're late.
not_available lt's almost 1 0:00.
not_available Yeah.
not_available l got held up at the hospital.
not_available Where's Walt and my sister? Something at your niece's school.
not_available lf you say you'll be here at 8, l need you to be here at 8.
not_available l've got an early shift tomorrow.
not_available Okay.
not_available How was your first day? How long ago was your mom's stroke? 
not_available 8 months.
not_available And it was a right parietal CVA? She's still suffering from left hemiparesis.
not_available Has she had any physical therapy at all? 
not_available Of course she has.
not_available ln the beginning.
not_available My mother doesn't have problems getting around.
not_available That's the problem.
not_available She's always wandering off.
not_available She's masking well, but she has limited use of her left arm and leg.
not_available And she's got bruises all over her left side from running into things.
not_available And you should have warned me about the incontinence.
not_available Yeah, well, that's just a sometime thing.
not_available Not tonight, it wasn't.
not_available Can you help my mother? l can't make her any younger, but l can probably improve her mobility.
not_available She's a great lady.
not_available l wish l'd known her before the stroke.
not_available l heard a lot about you.
not_available She wouldn't stop talking about her Petey.
not_available l'm sorry about that.
not_available You're the baby in the family, right? l'm the youngest in the family, yeah.
not_available My baby sister too.
not_available My mom just loves her to death.
not_available lt still pisses me off.
not_available Good night.

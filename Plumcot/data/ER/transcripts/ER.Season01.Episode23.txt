not_available Tag, come on .
not_available .
not_available .
not_available .
not_available Forget it, it's not worth it.
not_available Do you have a problem with authority? 
not_available Not generally.
not_available When it's enforced arbitrarily and undermines my authority, l resent it.
not_available Do you feel like l'm encroaching on you? Before you got here l ran the board .
not_available l made decisions, and nobody would contradict me in the middle of a trauma.
not_available l've stepped on your entitlements? 
not_available You treat me like a med student.
not_available l've been chief resident for a year.
not_available You don't act like it.
not_available Morgenstern told me you were the most impressive resident he'd seen .
not_available l'm thinking, '' ls this the same guy?'' You come in late, your attitude's bad .
not_available lt's like you don't want to be here.
not_available l don't stand in front of the board all day because l want to.
not_available l do it because, from what l've seen, your head's not in the game.
not_available Hi .
not_available The nurse said he's gonna be okay.
not_available He can carry a conversation .
not_available His memory is intact.
not_available lt looks good .
not_available He's been asking about you .
not_available l'll bet.
not_available l wanna see him, but l don't want to take care of him.
not_available He'll be able to take care of himself.
not_available You don't know Donny.
not_available He's got problems.
not_available He gambles.
not_available l don't even know how much he owes.
not_available He's got this way of sucking you in and getting you to do stuff.
not_available lf he wasn't so sweet l would've killed him myself.
not_available lf you want to see a therapist
not_available l've done it.
not_available That's why l'm getting on a plane in three hours.
not_available This is it.
not_available l'm just so afraid he's gonna do it again .
not_available You know, really do it.
not_available lt's not easy.
not_available Donny's the first guy who really cared about me.
not_available But l can't be responsible.
not_available Will you give him that? Will you? 
not_available Sure.

not_available l didn't exactly volunteer.
not_available Did you settle things with Swift? 
not_available No, but we did share our feelings.
not_available He thinks l need an attitude adjustment, which l probably do.
not_available You don't disagree.
not_available Carter, did you pick up Taylor's film? 
not_available Ready in five.
not_available You can go to lunch after.
not_available Twenty minutes.
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton, you got a call from some loan service.
not_available l have to start repaying next month .
not_available How much do you owe? Eighty
not_available five thousand .
not_available One hundred and ten .
not_available Must be nice not to have to worry about loans, huh, Carter? l'll check on these films.
not_available ls Carter loaded? 
not_available He went to school with Davis' son .
not_available Are we talking millions? Or tens of millions? Peter, got a two
not_available fer.
not_available Let's hear it.
not_available Apparently, this one did it on a dare.

not_available He's a terrific guy, Carol .
not_available Excuse me, Nurse Hathaway.
not_available May l speak with you privately? 
not_available Sure.
not_available l haven't taken these yet.
not_available Why not? lt's possible that l may be pregnant.

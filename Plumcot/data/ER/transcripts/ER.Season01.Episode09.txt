not_available The hours, ludicrous staff meetings the stink of the halls and the patients.
not_available The patients.
not_available You find yourself searching for ways not to hate them.

not_available Thanksgiving.
not_available What a farce! What do we gotta be grateful for, huh? Rwanda? Flesheating bacteria? Entertainment Tonight? 
not_available Mr.
not_available Luck, quiet.
not_available Piss off! That's ironic, coming from a man with no kidneys.
not_available Labs are back.
not_available He's uremic.
not_available Blood alcohol's .25.
not_available And the media.
not_available Brainwashers, all of them filling kids' heads with filth! I love you, you love me We're a happy family Mr.
not_available Luck, how long has it been since you were dialyzed? Those Nazis at the clinic won't let me in the door.
not_available Apparently Mr.
not_available Luck was banned for abusing the staff.
not_available l got a right to my opinion, don't l? Mr.
not_available Luck, you're an end
not_available stage renal failure.
not_available But don't worry.

not_available Excuse me.
not_available We've got a deep lac here.
not_available About 1 0 centimeters.
not_available Don't worry.

not_available Clear the way! He's conscious.
not_available Broken right femur, pressure 90 over 60.
not_available Pulse 1 1 0.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Someone call Ortho.
not_available lt hurts! Where does it hurt? 
not_available My guts.
not_available What happened? Ran a red, hit a 22year
not_available old girl.
not_available He the driver? 
not_available Don't know.
not_available Car belonged to Larry Parks.
not_available Are you Larry Parks? 
not_available No, Andy.
not_available That must be the girl.
not_available They left her there.
not_available Decapitated.
not_available Okay, Andy? Andy, tell me where it hurts.
not_available Here? Here? Everywhere! Carol, we need to hold him down.
not_available You gotta stay still.
not_available lt hurts! Can we give him something? 
not_available 50 mg of Demerol.
not_available Let's prep for lavage.
not_available l need a catheter.
not_available l got it.
not_available Any heart sounds? 
not_available Negative.
not_available Give him more atropine.
not_available A lot of gray matter here.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available ls he salvageable? Call Neuro.
not_available Get the saline and tube ready.
not_available l'm not giving up yet.
not_available Come on.
not_available Wait! What are you doing? Relax.
not_available They gave you an anesthetic so you won't be in pain.
not_available Why are they cutting me? Listen to me.
not_available My name is Carol.
not_available l'll tell you what's happening.
not_available They made a nick in your belly so they can fill your abdomen with fluid.
not_available Once it's full, they'll watch as the fluid drains out.
not_available lf blood comes out, you have injuries and you'll need to have surgery.
not_available What do you think? Call the O.R., tell them we're on our way.
not_available You're going to surgery now.
not_available Oh, God! Larry! Time of death, 9:33.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Let's move.
not_available l'll make sure we got a room.
not_available Carol.
not_available lt was me.
not_available What was you? l was driving Larry's car.
not_available lt's my fault.
not_available l killed him.
not_available Oh, God, l killed him! The space shuttle.
not_available Now there's a bright idea.
not_available Let's spend 50 billion so six guys can sit in a tin can and test the effect of weightlessness on fruit flies.
not_available ls that kid gonna make it? 
not_available l think so.
not_available One out of three.
not_available What a waste.
not_available When l see that, l think, ''There but for the grace of God.'' Tell me about it.
not_available ln high school, we'd race this guy's TR7 on River Road pin the speedometer at 1 20.
not_available We'd climb those giant TV antennas up to the top.
not_available Must've been 200, 300 feet.
not_available You did that? Otto Jevitch.
not_available His dad was a demolitions expert.
not_available We'd steal dynamite and play chicken.
not_available l don't believe you.
not_available The worst thing Howie and l ever did was Chinese fire drills at the Velvet Freeze.
not_available l guess you and Howie were born to be wild.
not_available Did l miss something? Just being publicly ridiculed.
not_available How about some coffee? Sure.
not_available Hey, Doug.
not_available John, glad you showed up.
not_available This kid's elbow's the size of a grapefruit.
not_available Sure, just give me one second.
not_available Yeah.
not_available l'll just go through my mail.
not_available Sorry, Lydia.
not_available Oh, don't be.
not_available That's the best kiss l've experienced in months.
not_available Find someone to cover you? 
not_available No.
not_available Keep trying.
not_available Mom won't start supper till 7.
not_available She's really looking forward to seeing you.
not_available l'll try.
not_available l gotta go, but 
not_available l'll see you.
not_available Bye.
not_available All yours.
not_available So what's your name? My name is John Carter.
not_available You've grown awfully quiet, John Carter.
not_available Oh, l see.
not_available l had a friend once.
not_available We would go to lunch, happy hours shopping.
not_available Over drinks one night, l told her about myself.
not_available She stood up, left the table and never spoke to me again.
not_available l used to feel those things made me stronger more sure of who l was.
not_available These days l spend three hours putting on my face before l dare go outside.
not_available Plucking and waxing.
not_available And even then, someone always notices.
not_available l can see by the look in their eyes.
not_available The disgust.
not_available Maybe they're right.
not_available Maybe l am disgusting.
not_available Turn your head the other way, please.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Hey, Lydia! Hey, Al.
not_available What you got? Guy needs to be cleared for booking.
not_available He's bleeding all over my squad car.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, got a patient.
not_available l'm not a ''grownup'' doctor.
not_available We all know that, but there's no one else available.
not_available What happened? 
not_available He was attacked by a turkey.
not_available A turkey? What's open? 
not_available Trauma One.
not_available Francis is an animal
not_available rights nut.
not_available Activist.
not_available Whatever.
not_available There's this Thanksgiving display in one of the malls.
not_available Dried corn, straw, guys dressed like Pilgrims.
not_available They also got this live, big mother of a turkey
not_available They were exploiting the bird.
not_available lt was disgusting.
not_available So Francis decides to steal the bird.
not_available To rescue it! You grabbed the bird, threw it in your car and took off.
not_available That's stealing.
not_available lt was being abused.
not_available Now comes the good part.
not_available During the getaway, the turkey attacks him.
not_available lt starts clawing and pecking at his head.
not_available So what does Francis do? He breaks the bird's neck! And the upshot of it is, you guys get a fresh bird for your party.
not_available Oh, my God! You better take that outside.
not_available ls that a Narragansett tom? lt sure is! He's a big fella too.
not_available l kind of doubt if Dietary will want to prepare it.
not_available l'll do it.
not_available l used to pluck birds as a kid.
not_available This one's a beaut.
not_available He was listing all the symptoms of a major depression.
not_available That explains a few things.
not_available l know you've never liked Div, but please don't run him down in front of me.
not_available Sorry.
not_available lt just hurts to see him like this.
not_available l don't know what to do.
not_available lf he's depressed, he needs psychiatric help.
not_available l don't want to back him into a corner.
not_available Someone's gotta say something.
not_available lf he's that bad he shouldn't be treating patients.
not_available Your concern for Div is touching.
not_available Thanks for the advice.
not_available l just think he should see someone.
not_available l got that.
not_available You should've seen the condition of his cage.
not_available lt was like a cell.
not_available His water dish was dry.
not_available That's no good.
not_available People forget that we share the same biological heritage as every creature on the planet.
not_available That first lizard who crawled out of the ooze is a distant cousin to us all.
not_available l never thought about it.
not_available You don't keep your cousin in a cage with no water.
not_available You don't eat your family.
not_available Oh, my God! Could you please shut the blind? Sure, Francis.
not_available Are you okay? Doctor, can l tell you something? When l was under attack my most primitive fightor
not_available flight instinct kicked in and l was a beast! When l grabbed the bird's neck and heard it snap there was a part of me that secretly enjoyed it.
not_available ls your father still living? Yes, he is.
not_available l didn't really know my dad until just a few years ago.
not_available l hadn't seen him for ten years, when out of the blue he called.
not_available Said he wanted to see me.
not_available He had no idea.
not_available So l put on a jadegreen short
not_available sleeved silk dress.
not_available And that's how l answered the door.
not_available Know what he said? He said, ''Are you Henry's girlfriend?'' And l said, ''No, Dad.
not_available lt's me.'' And he said ''You look just like your sister.'' Then he said he came to see me because he was dying.
not_available Before he died, he said, ''Henry you may wear a dress but you're still my son.'' l'm done.
not_available You should stay here for about a half
not_available hour to make sure there's no reaction to the antibiotics.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene.
not_available Good morning, ma'am.
not_available What kind of thread you using? 40 absorbable sub
not_available Q.
not_available Nice apposition, well spaced.
not_available Good job.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Bravo.
not_available Thank God.
not_available God? There is no God, lady.
not_available When can l get the hell out of here? Very soon.
not_available lt took some doing but l talked the clinic into taking you back.
not_available Who asked you? Your appointment is Tuesday.
not_available l ain't going.
not_available Mr.
not_available Luck if you don't go you'll come back here, and neither of us wants that.
not_available Shove it! Excuse me? 
not_available Are you deaf too? l said, shove it you little pinheaded puke! Excuse me.
not_available l'm trying to find my son.
not_available What's his name? 
not_available Andrew Bohlmeyer.
not_available Andy.
not_available Yes.
not_available ls he all right? He was taken to surgery.
not_available They're removing his spleen.
not_available Oh, my God! 
not_available l'll take you up.
not_available Please.
not_available Edie! Andrea, l went by the house! 
not_available l was out.
not_available Where are they? Where's the other boy? Larry Parks? Are you Larry's mother? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Where is he? What? Mrs.
not_available Parks your son was brought in with injuries to his head
not_available Are you telling me he's dead? Yes, he is.
not_available l'm sorry.
not_available l am not a baby, for God's sake.
not_available Can't you just put it in my mouth? Hospital policy, Mr.
not_available Luck.
not_available l'll be back in ten minutes.
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available How about a little privacy here? What's so funny? You never seen a guy get his temperature taken before? Andy.
not_available How you doing, honey? Tired.
not_available Numb.
not_available You're not in any pain? No.
not_available The girl, is she okay? No, she's not.
not_available How did it happen, honey? Larry ran a red light.
not_available He was trying to beat it.
not_available l told him to stop, but he said he could make it.
not_available Oh, Andy.
not_available How awful.
not_available Sweetie.
not_available Thank God you're all right.
not_available l never said you were boring.
not_available You implied it.
not_available You're an extremely dynamic individual, especially in those glasses.
not_available What's wrong with them? 
not_available Nothing.
not_available Going to surgery.
not_available ln college, every Friday night l'd go to the Rathskeller and drink lots of beer.
not_available Pitchers! You're right.
not_available l've never done anything irresponsible.
not_available lrresponsible is overrated.
not_available l've never been arrested.
not_available l've never spent money on something that l didn't need.
not_available And l have never been to Bermuda with a horny saleslady.
not_available lt's the Bahamas, and l wouldn't go if she weren't paying.
not_available She's paying? 
not_available She pays for everything.
not_available l feel like a kept man.
not_available l have never been a kept man.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene! She came in with chest pain, collapsed in the waiting room.
not_available How long have you been in pain? An hour.
not_available l was in the kitchen, cooking dinner and the pressure started here.
not_available ls it a heart attack? 
not_available l'm not sure.
not_available Have you been sick? l was diagnosed with lupus last year.
not_available She's been in remission.
not_available Call Cardiology.
not_available We need to get a consult.
not_available Get an EKG, cardiac enzyme and a chest film.
not_available Sir, you'll have to wait outside.
not_available No! l want him here.
not_available All right.
not_available All right.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Sit down.
not_available Lie back.
not_available Just relax, breathe easy.
not_available We're gonna take care of you.
not_available He told you he was driving and you didn't tell anyone? Who am l supposed to tell? The police, for one.
not_available Carol, the kid committed manslaughter.
not_available He killed two people.
not_available l'm not sure it's my place.
not_available Well, you know how it is.
not_available Patients think they're dying and tell us things they wouldn't tell their husbands or wives.
not_available Or their priests.
not_available This kid unburdened his soul to me.
not_available l just don't feel right passing that on.
not_available Mark.
not_available You guys moonlighting as cardiologists? Gurunian and Bell are in surgery, Kayson's on his way.
not_available Until he gets here, we're it.
not_available Patient's 40, history of lupus, treated with prednisone.
not_available Presented with chest pain, heart rate's 1 1 2, pulsus paradoxlus.
not_available EKG shows an ST elevation.
not_available Think there's an effusion? l do.
not_available Sarah? Well, there's the silhouette sign.
not_available Blood pressure's dropping.
not_available She needs a centesis.
not_available Ever done one? 
not_available Lots of times.
not_available She's unconscious.
not_available Move her to Trauma.
not_available We can't wait.
not_available l'll need an 1 8
not_available gauge PC needle and clip.
not_available What's happening? There's a thin sack around the heart called the pericardium.
not_available Your wife's is filling with fluid, so the heart can't beat properly.
not_available We'll insert a needle and drain the fluidStick a needle in her heart? 
not_available Near her heart.
not_available You know, Sarah l've never done one of these procedures and since you've done a lot
not_available You want to do it? Do it.
not_available l'll back you up.
not_available Hey.
not_available That's funny.
not_available l was just thinking about you.
not_available Pleasant thoughts? Very pleasant.
not_available Have a seat.
not_available Actually l feel like l owe you an apology.
not_available l know that lately l've been difficult, to put it mildly.
not_available l'm sorry if l've embarrassed you.
not_available You haven't embarrassed me.
not_available l'm worried about you.
not_available Well, l've been pretty depressed.
not_available Have you thought about talking to someone? A therapist? Things are starting to fall into place.
not_available l wouldn't worry too much.
not_available Are we still on for dinner? With your sister and her new beau? l wouldn't miss it.
not_available Maybe we can talk afterwards.
not_available l'd like that.
not_available Mrs.
not_available Parks? Can l get you anything? Call you a ride? What? No.
not_available lf l 
not_available could just sit down.
not_available Sure.
not_available Sure.
not_available l just saw my son.
not_available He was so cold.
not_available l looked at his face and all l wanted to do was to slap him.
not_available To hit him and to say ''You stupid boy! How could you do this to yourself? That poor girl.
not_available How could you leave me?'' Oh, my God! What's wrong with me? You seen my patient? Middle
not_available aged.
not_available She
not_available male? Must've gone to the ladies room.
not_available lnsert the needle at about 45 degrees, gently aspirating as you go.
not_available When you reach the pericardium, you'll draw fluid.
not_available The EKG will let you know if you touch the heart.
not_available l gotta be getting close.
not_available Anything? No.
not_available Pull back! You've hit heart muscle.
not_available What's going on? Nothing's coming out.
not_available The pericardium must be infected.
not_available The fluid's too thick for the needle.
not_available She's fibrillating.
not_available Charging.
not_available Ready.
not_available Clear! 
not_available Got a pulse.
not_available Let's crack her.
not_available Crack her and morbidity increases greatly.
not_available lf we don't release the pressure, she could die.
not_available Do a window.
not_available Make an 8
not_available centimeter cut at the xiphoid.
not_available Do it now.
not_available Okay.
not_available Open the diaphragm.
not_available Cut out a window of pericardium.
not_available Two inches.
not_available Not too big or her heart will jump out.
not_available You can do it.
not_available Do it.
not_available That's it.
not_available Keep going.
not_available Keep going.
not_available That's it.
not_available Suction.

not_available We got fluid.
not_available We got a beat.
not_available Oh, man.
not_available Pressure's back.
not_available Stitch around the tube.
not_available l think you can take it from here.
not_available Andy? How are you? l'm okay.
not_available Police talk to you yet? They will.
not_available Andy l heard what you told your mother.
not_available And l understand why.
not_available You're in a lot of pain.
not_available You don't want to bring on more.
not_available ls it fair to let Larry's mother believe he killed that girl? l know you feel guilty, but it's only gonna get worse.
not_available l know.
not_available l've kept things from people.
not_available lt makes you hate yourself.
not_available lt makes it hard to live with yourself.
not_available Ever kill anyone before? No.
not_available But l've done things to hurt people.
not_available People close to me.
not_available And you told them? Not everything, no.
not_available lt's not so easy.
not_available ls it? What's going on? 
not_available Jumper on the roof.
not_available Some lady.
not_available Looks like she's gonna go.
not_available Oh, God! Excuse me.
not_available She's my patient.
not_available Miss Carleton! Please.
not_available Please.
not_available Don't come any closer.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay.
not_available Miss Carleton, l know you're feeling terrible right now but there's people in the hospital that can help you.
not_available l can't pass for a woman anymore.
not_available That's all l've ever wanted to be.
not_available Could you just look at me? Just look at me and talk to me.
not_available We could talk about it.
not_available Carter.
not_available Oh, thank God! Like to introduce me to your friend? Miss Carleton there's a doctor here who can help you.
not_available ls it okay if he talks
not_available No! Don't! Oh, God! That looks good.
not_available This is really good
not_available Party time! Hey, Haleh, pass the yams, please.

not_available No.
not_available Can we take a walk? Sure.
not_available Ready? 
not_available Ready as l'll ever be.
not_available Here's your ticket.
not_available Oh, my God! These are coach.
not_available Hold on.
not_available Oh, to be a kept man.
not_available Not one complaint out of you.
not_available ln an hour you'll be at the table with your wife your daughter and your family all around.
not_available And l'm gonna be at 30,000 feet sucking down vodka gimlets with a woman who dresses me.
not_available You have no idea how lucky you are.

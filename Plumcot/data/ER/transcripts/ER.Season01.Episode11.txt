not_available l ran into a problem with the patient's wife.
not_available What? His wife won't sign the consent.
not_available You called the team before you had consent? His driver's license gave us permission.
not_available l told you to contact the family.
not_available lt's his wife's decision, not yours.
not_available lf she doesn't want it, we don't do it.
not_available You've got eight transplant surgeons flying in with patients and families waiting at the other end.
not_available lf we can't harvest, what are you gonna tell these people? You need an antidepressant.
not_available l'll give you the name of a therapist.
not_available My sadness may be connected to something that happened a long time ago.
not_available On Christmas? Forty years ago a young man proposed to me, and l said no.
not_available lt was the biggest mistake of my life.
not_available Why'd you say no? He was Jewish.
not_available My parents didn't approve.
not_available And last year after my mother died, l found his letters.
not_available She'd kept them hidden from me.
not_available He wanted to know why l wouldn't answer his letters why l stopped loving him.
not_available He lived in Tulsa.
not_available So l got his number and l called him.
not_available And a beautiful voice that l hadn't heard in 40 years answered.
not_available lt was his son.
not_available Sammy died three years ago.
not_available Hey, Mark! 
not_available Can l borrow your pen? Great save on that mesenteric rupture.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Listen, l've got a problem.
not_available l've got a gork's wife who won't sign a consent.

not_available l see Malik taught you his trick.
not_available l know sometimes it's scary to tell the truth.
not_available Especially about stuff that happens at home.
not_available When your mom and dad argue, you don't wanna take sides, right? Telling the truth isn't taking sides it's just saying what happened.
not_available And if we knew what really happened to your mom we might be able to help her more.
not_available She didn't fall down the stairs, did she? Here you go.
not_available Don't worry, Frank.
not_available Your mom's gonna be fine, all right? Just fine.

not_available Just hoped she would? Nobody likes being replaced.
not_available Glad l did it first.

not_available ray, right away.
not_available Go find Carter.
not_available He keeps disappearing.
not_available We'll do this on my count and we'll do it right.

not_available That's nothing compared to.
not_available l don't think we have any uneven parallel bars.

not_available l don't think l've ever seen such an old little boy.
not_available So you elected not to cardiovert?

not_available Hypotensive with chest pain? 
not_available The pain was controlled.
not_available Somewhat.
not_available Let's continue, please.

not_available No.
not_available Heart rate dropped.
not_available EKG shows an acute inferior wall Ml.
not_available Why the delay in intubation? You had the bad gases.
not_available l thought bagging would help.
not_available When l got the gases back, l tubed him.
not_available So you recommended drug therapy.
not_available TPA? l do angioplasty with my Mls.
not_available The TPA messed everything up.
not_available He had no contraindications, and time is heart muscle.
not_available l was on my way! 
not_available l didn't know.
not_available People, please.
not_available This is just a teaching session.
not_available What was the outcome? Did the angiocath and it was a mess.
not_available He bled like a stuck pig.
not_available Before l got to the angioplasty his heart rhythm went haywire.
not_available Shocked him and he revived.
not_available EKG became normal.
not_available The artery opened.
not_available So you never did angioplasty? l could hardly
not_available And the TPA worked? Dr.
not_available Benton, what would you do? Angioplasty.
not_available Dr.
not_available Langworthy? Angioplasty.
not_available Dr.
not_available Greene? Angioplasty.
not_available Just because we're friends doesn't mean we'll always agree.
not_available l'm getting dragged over the coals, you stroll in late, don't say a word.
not_available l missed the first half.
not_available How was l supposed to comment? Didn't stop you commenting in the end.
not_available Why do l feel like a traitor? You know, it wasn't personal.
not_available l'm dying out there and you're siding with the slicers and dicers.
not_available Benton and Langworthy are surgeons.
not_available They only want to cut people open.
not_available That may be an exaggeration.
not_available The patient was fine with a dose of TPA versus a $ 1 0,000 surgery.
not_available My decision was valid, you should've backed me up.
not_available You seen the chart on the sliced finger in the Suture Room? Yep.
not_available Did Proserpina find you? Who? Oh, Liz.

not_available Why should they? l'm not going to die on them.
not_available Not today.
not_available l've had a lot of time to think about dying.
not_available Can't say l recommend it.
not_available A nice fat stroke would have suited me better.
not_available But each morning l wake up l think of as a gift.
not_available And there's this feeling l have.
not_available l don't know when it's going to happen.
not_available But l know when it's not.

not_available Listen, l was hoping that
not_available l know that you're seeing Taglieri, but.
not_available l was thinking you and l could see each other again.
not_available l would've tried suicide earlier if it was such a turn on for you.
not_available l'm serious.
not_available No, you're not.
not_available You're standing there like a puppy because you feel guilty.
not_available No, l don't.
not_available l mean l do, but that's not what this is about.
not_available lt is.
not_available You think you had something to do with my swallowing the pills.
not_available Well, you didn't.
not_available There were actually more depressing events in my life than you.
not_available Tell me about them.
not_available l wanna know.
not_available lt's a combination of things, you know.
not_available Too much stuff starts piling up, you feel trapped.
not_available l spend a lot of time talking about all this stuff with my shrink, so.
not_available l have a lot of work to do.
not_available Look, Carol.
not_available You really wanna be with Taglieri? He was there before this happened, and when it happened.
not_available What we had is it worth another chance? You thought what we had didn't work.
not_available l don't suppose we could talk you out of this? l told you l'd be in first thing in the morning for the rest of my transfusion.
not_available l can't miss one minute of one thing.
not_available Not one minute, one hour, one day.
not_available When l was your age l never thought of such things.
not_available l do.
not_available Life might be giving up on me, but l'm not giving up on it.

not_available Come quick! Mark's hurt.
not_available Surprise! We wanted to give something to let you know how glad we are that you're back.
not_available Eight weeks ago, you grabbed our attention.
not_available So if you feel like you need to do that again we'd like you to put this on instead.
not_available Speech! To say l feel lucky would be kind of an understatement.
not_available What you all did to save me was like a gift.
not_available l've promised myself to remember that every day, so thank you.

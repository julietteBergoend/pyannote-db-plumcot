not_available Why Colorado? 
not_available His dad is there.

not_available What about Dad, you let him know Alex might be on his way or calling? He's not that easy to get ahold of.
not_available Why's that? He's in prison.
not_available Alex doesn't know that his dad is in jail.
not_available He's been asking me if he can go live with him
not_available I'm sorry, shouldn't we be calling Amtrak or the airlines? No, they won't board a minor without parental consent.

not_available This happens all the time.
not_available Nine times out of 10, they're back home in 24 hours or less.
not_available Alex doesn't have 24 hours.

not_available Great.
not_available Moving on.
not_available Whoa.
not_available Good teaching case.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Take a minute and tell us all about fomepizole.
not_available Well, it's pretty new.
not_available Yeah? What does it do? Lowers the ethylene glycol level? Tell them how.
not_available Increases renal excretion.
not_available Anyone else? 
not_available Does it inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase? I think it might prevent formation of acidic metabolites.
not_available Get it in early and you avoid dialysis.
not_available I'm gonna read about this and make a handout.
not_available R
not_available 2s have to do the reading before rounds.
not_available How? I just got here.
not_available Get here early.
not_available Teaching should be spontaneous, offthe
not_available cuff.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Is there somewhere private I can go breastfeed? We've been here three hours.
not_available My kid needs to eat.
not_available Yeah, yeah, there's a family room down the hallway.
not_available Mom, I'm starving.

not_available How old is that kid?

not_available Hi, yes.
not_available This is Luka Kovac again.
not_available Hello.
not_available What is it? 
not_available Altered traffic collision.
not_available GCS, eight.
not_available Systolic's 100.
not_available Let's bag her.
not_available What's your plan, Ray? 
not_available All right.
not_available Intubation, FAST exam and a head CT.
not_available Okay.
not_available I'll be in Curtain 2.
not_available Dr.
not_available Lewis? 
not_available Call me if you need me.
not_available I guess she trusts you.
not_available Yeah, 20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.
not_available Portable C
not_available spine and chest to follow.
not_available Get that SonoSite ready.
not_available Come here.
not_available Mind if I intubate? Might wanna observe one first.
not_available Why do we use etomidate? 
not_available We need a sedative with a paralytic.
not_available No, I know that.
not_available But isn't it true that ketamine causes less respiratory depression? Maybe.
not_available Well, does it have a more favorable hemodynamic profile? If you're concerned about interabdominal hemorrhaging, then it
not_available Jane, we use etomidate because it's a good drug.
not_available Okay, let me take a look.
not_available Sats up to 92.
not_available All right, pull the handle at 45 degrees and never rock back against the teeth.
not_available Shouldn't you give a dose of Pavulon? 
not_available Sometimes we do, yeah.
not_available Is sux okay in crush injuries? Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Cricoid pressure.
not_available What about hyperkalemia? Look, never seen it happen.
not_available The 8
not_available 0, it won't pull through.
not_available All right.
not_available We need a smaller tube.
not_available Bag her.
not_available Is sux okay in burn patients? More observation and less conversation.
not_available We tube her and then we can chat, okay? 
not_available Seven and a half.
not_available Okay.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Sergeant Parker wouldn't tell us what this was about.
not_available We haven't found your son yet.
not_available Twelve thousand fliers went out.
not_available Precincts, hospitals, state police.
not_available We notified the folks in Colorado and we're getting some play on local television.
not_available Please, have a seat.
not_available We canvassed the airline ticket counters, Union Station, buses.
not_available Nobody recognized your son.
not_available Hey.
not_available Thanks for coming back down.
not_available Still nothing from Alex? No, no.
not_available You know, I'm sorry.
not_available Why didn't you tell us this over the phone? Why did you want us to come down here? We got a report of an unidentified diabetic kid in a coma.
not_available It matches your son's general description.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available In all likelihood, it's not him.
not_available We're waiting for them to fax a photo, but the
not_available They're still working on him at the hospital.
not_available Where is he? 
not_available Iowa.
not_available Davenport, Iowa.
not_available It's 200 miles.
not_available I'll drive.
not_available They'll know if it's him or not before we get there.
not_available If it's him, we'll be closer.
not_available If not, we'll be farther away.
not_available I can't just sit at the house waiting for someone to call to tell me they've found Alex in a ditch somewhere or a Dumpster.
not_available I can't! Okay? I can't.
not_available Tell Dubenko the second HemoCue was 12.
not_available 1.
not_available Going to the O.
not_available R.? FAST was positive, needs an ex
not_available lap.
not_available How'd it go, Haleh? 
not_available It was a little rough.
not_available Do you wanna give Dr.
not_available Barnett some feedback? There wasn't much teaching.
not_available You seemed distracted by questions from the interns.
not_available Well, they wouldn't shut up.
not_available Ray.
not_available His frustration prevented the team from working together.
not_available There was tension in the room.
not_available Could have caused a delay in diagnosing a splenic lac.
not_available Oh, please.
not_available Thank you, Haleh.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What was that about? Improving your skills.
not_available Making you a better teacher, a better leader.
not_available Since when do nurses evaluate the Residents? Haleh's been here longer.
not_available She knows.
not_available I needed to treat this patient.
not_available You also need to create a positive learning climate.
not_available Are you torturing all the R
not_available 2s, or is it just me? Ray.
not_available Resolving TIA? Go.
not_available We must have missed it.
not_available They said it's over a mile from the interstate.
not_available We've only gone
not_available Ah! That's it.
not_available Hello? Anybody here? Excuse me.
not_available There's a button.
not_available Over there.
not_available Hold your horses, I'm coming.
not_available Hi, you have a boy in DKA? Security guard found him down behind Penney's at the mall, didn't have any ID.
not_available His blood sugar was 764, pH 7.10, GCS eight.
not_available Ketones were positive at one to 64.
not_available He's on IV saline, insulin and potassium.
not_available He just started opening his eyes on command.
not_available You just missed Dr.
not_available Hahn.
not_available He went home to get his digital camera so we could send a picture to Chicago.
not_available No.
not_available No, it wasn't him.
not_available Right.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Anything? 
not_available No, not yet.
not_available God! Damn it, Alex! Erica's fine to stay at the apartment till we get back.
not_available He's not coming home, Luka.
not_available You have the keys? Where are we going? Colorado.
not_available No infiltrate.
not_available Like I said, fever without source.
not_available Everything okay? 
not_available Well, he doesn't have pneumonia.
not_available Urine? 
not_available All clear.
not_available Rapid strep? 
not_available No clinical indication.
not_available Okay.
not_available Mason, can you open up your mouth for me? 
not_available I don't like that.
not_available Come on, you're a big boy.
not_available I already did it.
not_available Okay.
not_available Real quick, huh? Ah.
not_available A little bigger.
not_available Uh.
not_available Any rash? 
not_available No.
not_available He looks good.
not_available Can you remove his pajamas for me? 
not_available Dr.
not_available Babinski had him in a gown.
not_available I don't wanna take off my clothes again.
not_available Look, I'm sorry, but it's important.
not_available Okay? You said we can go home.
not_available I want to go home.
not_available Mason.
not_available Mason.
not_available Okay.
not_available I want to go home now! Mason, come on.
not_available Ray? 
not_available Two seconds.
not_available No! 
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Be right back.
not_available No! 
not_available Come on, Mason.
not_available No! 
not_available Come on, Mason.
not_available One more time.
not_available How's it going in there? Just looking for a fever source.
not_available Babinski said there wasn't one.
not_available You know how it is with interns.
not_available You gotta check up on them.
not_available But not for 20 minutes.
not_available The interns are doctors.
not_available You have to trust their skills.
not_available But they were students last week, don't know what they're doing.
not_available You're micromanaging every case.
not_available That's not good.
not_available We were caught up.
not_available We've got six to be seen and 20 in the rack.
not_available And that's my fault? I liked you better when you were the closer.
not_available Still no service.
not_available We're about 30 miles from Omaha, so we'll probably get service soon.
not_available Where in Colorado? 
not_available Huh? Where's Steve? Cañon City.
not_available Where's that? 
not_available In the mountains somewhere, I think.
not_available Never been.
not_available What? Colorado.
not_available Always wanted to go.
not_available I hear it's beautiful.
not_available Yeah.
not_available What were you and Alex fighting about? Last night, before he left? The usual.
not_available Me? Us.
not_available I should have just told him the truth.
not_available Well, he knew we were having trouble.
not_available No.
not_available The truth about his father.
not_available After the Attending leaves you alone in Trauma, you'll be critiqued by a nurse.
not_available That's weird.
not_available Even if the patient's crashing, make nice with the newbies or you'll be dinged.
not_available Ray, can I give another four of morphine to McKenzie? You think he needs it? 
not_available No, I just want him to stop breathing.
not_available Fine.
not_available You're responsible for everything the intern does but question the history, they get testy on you.
not_available Sounds like you had a great day.
not_available Yeah.
not_available You ready, Neela? Tonight's all about you and me.
not_available And me.
not_available Teddy Marsh, new intern.
not_available Hello.
not_available First shift.
not_available An overnight.
not_available Awesome.
not_available This is Neela.
not_available She's the R
not_available 2.
not_available She's in charge.
not_available Your mission, clear that board by morning.
not_available I'm so screwed.
not_available Antifreeze overdose has been here all night waiting on ICU.
not_available Let's step it up.
not_available The day shift wants to get out of here.
not_available Fomepizole's an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor.
not_available You'll be fine.
not_available What? 
not_available Neela, you're running rounds.
not_available Let's start.
not_available It's about nine hours to Denver.
not_available I think we can make it by dawn.
not_available You try to sleep.
not_available I'll drive.
not_available No, I'm okay.
not_available No, no.
not_available I'm awake.
not_available I'm not sure I will be in the next four hours.
not_available Shoot.
not_available My cell
not_available phone battery's almost dead.
not_available I should have brought my charger.
not_available Hey, Luka.
not_available Thank you.
not_available The calculated osmolality is approximated by multiplying the sodium concentration by two and adding glucose divided by 18 and the BUN, over 2.8.
not_available Anyone have the numbers handy? That's okay.
not_available We'll make some up.
not_available Let's say he's measured
not_available What does this have to do with a fractured rib? Absolutely nothing.
not_available I have a date.
not_available Go.
not_available We could be here all night.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Divided by 2.8.
not_available Twenty minutes and we're only on the second patient.
not_available Stay focused on the clinically relevant teaching points.
not_available It is.
not_available There's an osmolar gap.
not_available Interns need to know what that means.
not_available Not right now.
not_available Stab wound.
not_available Need some help here.
not_available Neela, take it with Marsh.
not_available Pratt, Morris, finish running the board.
not_available Ready? 
not_available My first trauma as a doc.
not_available All right.
not_available Single stab to the right chest, agonal resps, sats 84 on 15 liters.
not_available All right, Trauma 1, let's go.
not_available Now enter the thoracic cavity through the intercostal.
not_available Okay.
not_available I felt a pop.
not_available Okay, insert finger, feel lung tissue, pass the tube on a curved clamp.
not_available Pretty cool.
not_available My first night, my first chest tube.
not_available The key is to avoid the neurovascular bundle at the inferior margin of the rib.
not_available The tube won't pass.
not_available All right, let me try.
not_available I can't find the tract.
not_available Sometimes you need to check again with a finger.
not_available There is no tract.
not_available Did you enter the thoracic cavity? I thought I did.
not_available Did you feel lung tissue? It was warm and soft.
not_available Lung tissue expands and contracts with ventilation.
not_available Right.
not_available Now we're into the pleura.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I thought I was in.
not_available I'll do better next time.
not_available How you doing? Finishing up a chest tube.
not_available Can you start a central line? I got a cue ball versus cheek to sew up.
not_available Trauma patient takes priority.
not_available 0
not_available silk.
not_available Pulse is 98, BP is stable, what's the big deal? My guy needs a three
not_available layer closure on a complex stellate facial lac.
not_available That could take two hours.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Let Plastics do it.
not_available Someone needs to keep an eye on the board.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I told the nurses to send off labs and x
not_available rays on everyone.
not_available Morris! 
not_available Looks like everything's under control.
not_available Is that a vertical mattress? 
not_available No, it's horizontal.
not_available What are you doing? Bugs.
not_available It's difficult to see.
not_available Where are we? We passed Grand Island about an hour ago.
not_available We should get to a phone, call Chicago.
not_available Okay.
not_available What time is it? One
not_available thirty.
not_available I was dreaming about Alex.
not_available He was 2 or 3.
not_available And I needed a bathing suit so I was looking through the racks at some department store.
not_available And when I looked back, Alex was gone.
not_available He just vanished.
not_available I guess you don't have to be Freud to figure that one out.
not_available I lost my son at the ocean.
not_available Daniella didn't want me to take him, but I insisted.
not_available I was mad that she didn't trust me, so We had a big fight, and she let us go.
not_available What happened? It was a very hot day, so everyone had come to the beach.
not_available You have beaches in Croatia? Beautiful beaches.
not_available Miles of them.
not_available Anyway, so we found about an inch of sand that wasn't already taken, and we went down to the water.
not_available He wanted to build a sand castle so I went back up to pick up his little shovel and bucket.
not_available And when I came back, he was gone.
not_available I looked everywhere ran up and down the beach to the shops by the road, into the water.
not_available I couldn't find him.
not_available How long was he missing? Two hours.
not_available Where was he? Some boy had a dog.
not_available The police found him wandering.
not_available He knew his name, so they called our house and Daniella answered.
not_available When I got home, he was sitting in a bathtub with his sister having a wonderful time.
not_available I went to the kitchen and I cried by the sink, with the water running.
not_available What was his name? Marco.
not_available Alex is gonna be all right, Sam.
not_available We're gonna find him and he's gonna be all right.
not_available It's 3 a.
not_available m.
not_available Shouldn't this be slowing down by now? You've got a dark cloud, Neela.
not_available Always have.
not_available Twelve more out there triaging as we speak.
not_available Neurosurg is coming to see the subdural, he'll need a unit bed.
not_available I'm gonna lie down for a couple hours.
not_available Cool? We've got three intubated patients and a full board.
not_available You are more than capable of managing whatever comes in.
not_available What? That's the fun of being the big R
not_available 2.
not_available You get to be queen of the night shift.
not_available Don't wanna be.
not_available I wanna get the board cleared before day shift comes.
not_available Can I get a copy of your schedule? I'm trying to avoid nights that you're on.
not_available Are you going to bed and leaving me alone with this mess? 
not_available You're not alone.
not_available You have him.
not_available Busy? I wanna present my guy.
not_available Wake me only if it's really, really important.
not_available He's going to bed? 
not_available Yup.
not_available It's you and me against the world.
not_available Chuny had me correct your fentanyl order.
not_available It's micrograms, not milligrams.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available That could have led to a really serious mistake.
not_available It was caught in time, no harm done.
not_available I'm so sorry.
not_available Thanks for fixing it.
not_available It's okay.
not_available You gotta learn somehow.
not_available What you got? A 37year
not_available old with a deltoid abscess.
not_available Never done an I&amp;D;, thought you might wanna supervise me.
not_available Any other history? 
not_available Chronic IV drug use, that's about it.
not_available Physical? Fourby
not_available five fluctuant lesion on the lateral aspect of the upper arm.
not_available Remainder of the exam was entirely normal.
not_available Hey, doc.
not_available You ready to slice open this bad boy? This is Dr.
not_available Rasgotra.
not_available She's my supervisor.
not_available Just wanna take a quick listen.
not_available It's so satisfying when you guys cut it open and all that pus comes pouring out.
not_available Ten blade, saline, swabs, packing gauze.
not_available Anything else? Mr? 
not_available Kingsley.
not_available We'll be back in a minute.
not_available Okay? Did you listen to his heart? 
not_available Of course I did.
not_available So when you said his exam was entirely normal were you just forgetting to mention his murmur? He has a murmur? 
not_available Four over six at the left sternal border.
not_available He has a thrill.
not_available It's not subtle.
not_available Wow.
not_available Big miss.
not_available I'll listen again.
not_available You can't miss a murmur in an IV drug user.
not_available Could be endocarditis.
not_available He needs an echo and antibiotics before the I&amp;D.;
not_available I heard you were smart, but I had no idea you were such an awesome teacher.
not_available Thanks for saving my ass.
not_available What was that? I don't know.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Wait here.
not_available What is it? A deer, I think.
not_available Is it dead? No.
not_available I don't think so.
not_available I don't know.
not_available You folks need help? I didn't
not_available I didn't see it.
not_available Antelope.
not_available Did a real number to your car.
not_available You both all right? 
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got a rifle in the truck.
not_available Sam.
not_available We gotta keep going.
not_available Sam, the car's wrecked.
not_available The radiator's leaking.
not_available The windshield's shattered.
not_available You won't be able to see.
not_available Come on.
not_available Come on! Our syphilis guy's had over 50 partners in the last 90 days.
not_available Wants to know if they can come for treatment.
not_available As long as they wait till sunrise.
not_available Pen G, 2.4 million units IM.
not_available Neela! Your COPD'er isn't looking so good.
not_available Sats dropped to 87 on room air.
not_available Can hardly catch my breath.
not_available He was fine when I saw him, he wasn't wheezing.
not_available You can't wheeze if you're not moving air.
not_available We'll give you medicine to help.
not_available Albuterol, 5 migs with 500 of Atrovent.
not_available Sure that's a good idea? His theophylline's 53, he's throwing PVCs.
not_available What? You didn't bother mentioning a toxic theophylline level? I didn't know.
not_available I hadn't checked.
not_available Didn't think we'd have the level back till tomorrow.
not_available Breathing's been bad.
not_available I took some extra pills.
not_available A hundred of lidocaine and move him to Trauma.
not_available Hold off on the albuterol until we stabilize his arrhythmia.
not_available You got it.
not_available We'll be right back, Mr.
not_available Canberra.
not_available Whoa, you were great in there.
not_available You really took control.
not_available Teddy, listen
not_available I'm sorry about the theophylline thing.
not_available I'll have to thank Chuny for fixing it
not_available Just listen, okay? You wanna know a secret? You don't have to be that smart to be a good doctor.
not_available You just have to be thorough, systematic and meticulous.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available Not hard enough.
not_available You've missed glaring physical findings, overlooked critical labs and I've been correcting your med orders all night.
not_available It's my first shift.
not_available I realize that, but you're responsible for real people here and I can't watch your every move.
not_available I know that.
not_available And I wanna thank you
not_available And your attitude It's just so contrite and appreciative.
not_available It's just weird.
not_available I
not_available I guess I just don't get it.
not_available Wait
not_available I'm getting some coffee.
not_available Need anything? Teddy, wait! We'll do a headto
not_available toe H &amp; P together.
not_available Might help identify where some of your deficiencies are.
not_available Bollocks.
not_available They're gonna send a truck to tow the car in.
not_available Did you call Chicago? The guy inside gets off at 7.
not_available Offered us a ride back to North Platte.
not_available From there, we can catch a bus to Denver, or maybe rent a car.
not_available North Platte's an hour east? What are you doing? Sam? Sam.
not_available Sam! What are you doing? What does it look like? You gonna hitchhike? 
not_available He's been off his insulin for two days.
not_available He's out there dying.
not_available Hey! How'd it go? 
not_available Not well.
not_available Will you take a look at this board? It's not 8 a.
not_available m.
not_available and the day sucks.
not_available Morning.
not_available You should've called me.
not_available I hate leaving a mess for the day shift.
not_available Most of them are waiting for beds.

not_available What are you doing here, Luka? Sam, I care about Alex.
not_available But you can't replace his father.
not_available I know that.
not_available I'm just not ready for this to be all there is in my life.
not_available I can't bring your kids back.
not_available I have a child of my own, and if it's a choice between you and Alex I am always going to choose Alex.
not_available I'm not asking you to choose.
not_available Of course you are.
not_available I don't want what happened to my family to be the end of my story.
not_available I was a good father.
not_available I can be a good father again.
not_available And what if it's not what I want? Why don't you wanna have children with me? It's not about you.

not_available I drank lots of water.
not_available You were lucky.

not_available Should I see if the analgesics take effect? No, you should pick up another chart.
not_available You sure? Because you don't have to.
not_available I'm sorry, Alex.
not_available I wish that this wasn't your life.
not_available I can't tell you how much I wish that.
not_available It's okay, Mom.
not_available I wanna go.
not_available Here? Here? How about here?

not_available Oh, yeah? If I saw all the patients myself, we wouldn't get behind.
not_available Bet you're feeling pretty good about that.
not_available Mm
not_available hm.
not_available I can't believe it took me so long to figure it out.
not_available You haven't.
not_available What? You didn't show Sackowitz how to staple.
not_available You didn't teach Clemons about your approach to kidney stones.
not_available You did a trigger point, a jump test and completely ignored your interns.
not_available They were moving like slugs.
not_available You told me to step it up.
not_available Yeah, but your job isn't to just move the meat.
not_available You're a Resident now.
not_available The lady in Exam 3 spiked to 104.
not_available Guess I better go.
not_available Nice job on the board, Abby.
not_available What's the matter with her? She's a new R

not_available It's gonna be a long year.
not_available She'll catch on.
not_available But she's not supervising, she's not teaching.
not_available She's doing everything herself.
not_available You know, that reminds me of someone I used to know.
not_available How is he? Full of crap, like always.
not_available I meant Alex.
not_available He's okay.
not_available He wants to spend some time alone with his dad, so There's only 10 more minutes of visiting hours, so I figure Steve can't screw him up that bad in 10 minutes.
not_available God knows, I'm sure he'll try.
not_available Alex is a good kid.
not_available He'll figure it out.
not_available Goddamn it, that bastard.
not_available He couldn't care less about us but that little boy loves him anyway.
not_available What the hell is right about that? 
not_available Thank you.

not_available Now what? Home, I guess.
not_available I don't
not_available Luka, you cannot possibly want this for your life.
not_available Want what? 
not_available This! This mess.
not_available Isn't that something I get to decide for myself? No.
not_available If it were just me? Maybe.
not_available I'd better go in and check on him.
not_available Steve's in prison.
not_available You don't have to run anymore.
not_available I'm not running.
not_available I just don't want what you want.

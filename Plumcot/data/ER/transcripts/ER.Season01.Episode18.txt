
not_available Carter! 
not_available Dr.
not_available Benton.
not_available Did you pick up my labs? Where's Deb?

not_available Research is picking it up.
not_available Soon, l hope.
not_available Guy infarcted, needed a crash hemicolectomy.
not_available When? 
not_available A couple of hours ago.
not_available Who did the procedure? 
not_available Jagman.
not_available Jagman? Damn! Why didn't you admit the woman with sores? Her problem isn't surgical.
not_available She needs to be d√©brided.
not_available Otherwise, she won't heal.
not_available Maybe medicine will help, but she's not coming on my service.
not_available Those Dale Carnegie classes are really starting to show.
not_available He's been on for 48 hours straight.
not_available Traded a few shifts to be with his mom, and now it's.
not_available Payback time.
not_available There's a Code Brown in 2.
not_available Find a nurse, clean it up now! Move.
not_available Unfortunately, payback rolls downhill.
not_available Did l miss her breakfast? 
not_available Just starting.
not_available The Family Development person came by for three hours.
not_available Ms.
not_available Brown called.
not_available She said you passed with flying colors.
not_available They're expediting your application.
not_available Helen, l can't thank you enough.
not_available How's she been? Fever's gone, but l think she's homesick.
not_available She misses the nurse she was close to in Russia.
not_available Can l ask if she wants to live with me? Sure.
not_available Yes, l have a VCR.
not_available Hey, Doug.
not_available ls that Mark Greene, the future ER attending? 
not_available You found out.
not_available Not from you, schmuck.
not_available l didn't want it to get out until Morgenstern made the announcement.
not_available Word's out.
not_available Congratulations.
not_available Thanks.
not_available What did Jen say? She signed on for another year with the judge.
not_available ln Milwaukee? Oh, no.
not_available lt's been awful.
not_available But if l can make this shot there's still hope for my marriage.
not_available There's hope.
not_available When did the rash appear? Two days ago, with a fever.
not_available lt started on your chest? Yeah.
not_available Then it spread.
not_available l think l'm allergic to one of the medications.
not_available What are you taking? 
not_available Here.

paper ''lf you suffer from asthma, nicotine addiction, panic attacks, call this number.
not_available Earn extra cash.'' They pay you? 
not_available Oh, yeah.
not_available l'm doing this one where they inject radioactive isotopes into my brain.
not_available That one pays real well.
not_available We'll call the numbers on the vials, to see which drug is causing your reaction.
not_available But for now, your test subject days are over.
not_available How much you make a year? 
not_available Did you stick Mr.
not_available Penny for blood gases? 
not_available Yes.
not_available Discharge the abscess? 
not_available Just need your signature.
not_available Dr.
not_available Hicks.
not_available l wasn't called for the bowel infarction? You traded shifts.
not_available l was the resident on call.
not_available You've been on for 48 hours straight.
not_available What does that have to do with it? Have you slept? l need very little sleep.
not_available l am capable
not_available l didn't think so.
not_available You shouldn't be treating patients in your condition.
not_available l've never done a bowel infarction.
not_available Jagman has done two.
not_available This isn't a competition.
not_available Oh, no? Then why do we have to keep logs of every procedure? As a record.
not_available Not a scorecard.
not_available Right.
not_available You're keeping score and you know it.
not_available That's enough.
not_available Your fatigue is impairing your judgment.
not_available Go and lie down, two hours.
not_available That won't be necessary.
not_available This isn't a suggestion.
not_available You will not see another patient until you've slept.
not_available Are you kidding? We don't have time for this.

not_available She said she wants to go out with you.
not_available What? Just kidding.
not_available Think it was about that guy you decked.

not_available lt was a great catch, Joyce.
not_available l never would've thought of sickle cell.
not_available Yes, you do.
not_available Anyway, l do have a favor.
not_available This kid on experimental meds is getting worse.
not_available Susan can't make anything of it.
not_available Could you please come down here and bail her out? Thank you.
not_available Here you go.
not_available She's on her way down.
not_available Thanks.

not_available Must've missed it.
not_available We're building a new hospital for the 21 st century, scrapping the old model in favor of a more collaborative paradigm.
not_available Like a team approach? Yes, but on a comprehensive scale.
not_available We're rethinking the hospital architecturally, organizationally ergonomically.
not_available We hope to build the model on which all future hospitals will be based.
not_available So you'd like to see how it shouldn't be done? On the contrary.
not_available l want to keep what works and change what doesn't.
not_available Feel free to look around.
not_available Great.
not_available l may have a solution to you and your wife's geographic impasse.
not_available Excuse me?

not_available l'll put them here on the end of the table.

not_available l'm cutting back my shifts.
not_available Really? What? lt seems like a tough way to start off a marriage.

not_available l'm certainly no expert on marriage.
not_available Forget l said anything.
not_available Mercy General's calling about a kid with a burned hand.
not_available l'll be right back.
not_available Didn't mean to wake you.

not_available Your daughter was seen at another hospital with a star
not_available shaped burn.
not_available We want to know what's going on.

not_available This is not a radiator burn, ma'am.
not_available Now, what really happened? 
not_available lt's personal.
not_available Maybe l can talk with her alone.
not_available l'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for what's happening.
not_available But if you want me to help Bonnie you have to tell me the truth.
not_available Most people don't understand.
not_available l'm pretty understanding.
not_available You promise you won't tell the doctor? She touches herself.
not_available Down there.
not_available l tell her not to.
not_available l give her three chances.
not_available Then l use the paperweight.
not_available The paperweight? l put it on the stove.
not_available l didn't mean to hurt her.
not_available l guess l just left it on too long.
not_available lt's not as bad as it sounds.
not_available My mother did the same thing to me.
not_available The doctor's gonna want a plastic surgeon to see her hand so you need to stay.
not_available All right.
not_available KLEl
not_available N.
not_available First name, Roger.
not_available l don't know the street.

not_available Actually, could l have a 1 0 for two of the fives? Right there.
not_available Here you are.
not_available You gave me 1 9.
not_available Nineteen? You're an honest man.
not_available You wanna get that? l got it.
not_available l have ones here.
not_available Why don't l give you a buck.

not_available My internist, Dr.

not_available l haven't examined him yet.

not_available You're supposed to wait for a consult.
not_available Please let him go.
not_available l'm dying here.
not_available You wanna examine him? Here.
not_available Go ahead, examine him.
not_available Don't pull this crap again.
not_available This is all so unnecessary.
not_available Excuse me? This territorialism.
not_available Friction between departments.
not_available lt's all an outdated, patriarchal system based on confrontation.
not_available Where he who yells loudest wins, even though he may be totally wrong.
not_available That's how it is.
not_available lt doesn't have to be.
not_available Picture a hospital without departments.
not_available Where every floor is staffed by a team of specialists.
not_available No time wasted on battles about ''Your service, my service.'' They've been replaced by a more evolved, harmonious feminine model, in which the patient belongs to us.
not_available Sounds good.
not_available Does it exist? lt will.
not_available l'm building it.
not_available And you are again.? John Koch.
not_available MlT, Sloan School of Management.

not_available l wanna stay with my mommy.
not_available lt's okay, sweetheart.
not_available Come on.
not_available l want my mommy! 
not_available l don't want her to go.
not_available This is her.
not_available Calm down! Get her feet! Give me back my baby! You lied, you lying bitch! You lying bitch! Please don't take my baby! All right, people.
not_available Let's get him prepped.
not_available Doc, knock me out, will you? Just take it easy.
not_available Help is on the way, okay? All right.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Christ! l haven't put him out yet.
not_available l didn't cut him.
not_available What's going on? Folks, we can all scrub out.
not_available The stone hath passed.
not_available Thank God! How are you feeling? l saw in your chart that you used to teach high school English.
not_available Was that here in Chicago? The hospital has a good library.
not_available l could get some books
not_available Maybe some Conrad? l spoke to three Roger Kleins in the Bloomington area none of them were your son.
not_available The phone company checked the unlisted numbers.
not_available l couldn't find him.
not_available ls there anyone else l can call? How long has it been since you spoke to your son? Ten years.

not_available Excuse me! My fault.
not_available You okay? Yeah, fine.
not_available Six lousy bucks.
not_available l've got it.
not_available Where's the vial? 
not_available Here.
not_available Quick, he's coming.
not_available What? You people have too much time on your hands.
not_available You should've heard that little girl.
not_available She cried for 45 minutes.
not_available When the social worker took her 
not_available she was still crying.
not_available She's better off.
not_available Growing up without a mother? 
not_available Her mother's a monster.
not_available l don't believe that.
not_available l think she was damaged a long time ago.
not_available l hope with therapy she'll improve so she can get her back.
not_available You're more hopeful than l am, thank God.
not_available l hear you're fostering Tatiana.
not_available You're gonna dissuade me, like everybody else? No.
not_available l think it's a wonderful thing you're doing.
not_available Really? 
not_available Absolutely.
not_available You'd make a great mother.
not_available Got a 1 6year
not_available old GSW to the neck.
not_available ETA seven minutes.
not_available Thanks.
not_available Please no dead kids today.
not_available How is he? BP's falling, respiration's down.
not_available l don't think he'll make it till morning.
not_available Thanks.
not_available l didn't know which you'd like, so l brought a few.
not_available Not a fan of Melville, l see.
not_available Oh, God.
not_available Excuse me for a second.
not_available Did you do the physical on the leg in 2? Not yet.
not_available l thought l'd spend some more time with Mr.
not_available Klein.
not_available She's been waiting half an hour.
not_available Why are you wasting time on a DNR? Because he's dying and he has no family.
not_available This is your surgical rotation not pastoral care.
not_available lt's not your job to become his family.
not_available There's more to patient care than cutting them open.
not_available And that's what nurses are for.
not_available Do the H and P on the leg pain and renew everyone's meds.
not_available l've got a drunk to stitch up.
not_available Stitch him up.
not_available lt's interesting how modern medicine dismantles the rituals of death.
not_available We do everything to make it routine, a non
not_available event.
not_available People don't die here, they ''code.'' We can do better.
not_available Can't believe l didn't think of it before.
not_available Kenosha! Kenosha.
not_available We can live there, be a family and commute.
not_available Never been there.
not_available lt's great.
not_available lt's right on the lake.
not_available Got great schools.

not_available Well, there it is.
not_available Here's our next lucky contestant.
not_available Who's this Diane Leeds who keeps calling you? Very desirable woman who'll never go out with me.
not_available Why not? One of her friends is one of my exes.
not_available Turned you down? Never bothered asking her out.
not_available You're afraid to ask her out? Nobody likes rejection.
not_available What do you got? .38 caliber.

not_available Shot in the heart.
not_available Thoracotomy tray.
not_available Don't they wear vests? 
not_available They're supposed to.
not_available l need some help in here! 
not_available Coming.
not_available Susan, you got this? 
not_available l got it.
not_available Where's Benton? Blood coming out of his mouth.
not_available Bullet holes in his chest? 
not_available Tube's in.
not_available No, just the neck.
not_available Bleeding in his lungs.
not_available lf l press harder, he'll stroke out.
not_available What have we got? 1 6yearold bullet to the carotid artery, thready pulse 
not_available blood in his lungs.
not_available What's going on there? Cop took a bullet into his heart.
not_available Susan's cracking his chest.
not_available Wait a second.

not_available l'm gonna go help Susan.
not_available l need some elbow room.

not_available Where is Carter? He's missing out on a valuable education here.
not_available l'll do a horizontal mattress, take two bites go under the coronary artery so l don't obstruct it.
not_available Better do it quick.
not_available His pressure's dropping.
not_available Now listen, boys and girls.
not_available The trick here is to plug up the hole without closing off the artery.
not_available Which is what l've just done.
not_available Pulled it through the ventricle.
not_available l stitched it.
not_available Who clamped the kid who went up? 
not_available l did.
not_available l'm getting a pulse.
not_available Nice job.
not_available Looks like that rest did you some good.
not_available Take him up.
not_available What a way to end the day.
not_available Taking off? 
not_available See you tomorrow.
not_available See you.
not_available l don't believe you.
not_available Me? l finished the file on the guy you attacked last week.
not_available Then l hear about your quarrel with a woman.
not_available This time l was the attackee.
not_available Are you all right? Not the first time l've been clawed by a female.
not_available You're paying for your bad karma.
not_available You've no idea.
not_available l don't know what Legal will say about defending you a second time.
not_available You defended me the first time? 
not_available That's my job.
not_available l need you to write out a statement.
not_available Again.
not_available And don't take so long getting it back to me this time.
not_available Listen, Diane.

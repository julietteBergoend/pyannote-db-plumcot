not_available What are you reading? 
not_available A book.
not_available Horton Hears a Who! 
not_available Oh, l remember that one.
not_available Keep going.
not_available '''l say!' murmured Horton.
not_available l've never heard tell of a speck of dust that is able to yell.
not_available So you know what l think? l think that there must be someone on top of that small speck of dust.
not_available Some sort of a creature of very small size too small to be seen by an elephant's eyes.
not_available Some poor little person who's shaking with fear that he'll blow in the pool.
not_available He has no way to steer! l'll just have to save him because after all a person's a person no matter how small.'' So cancel your credit card.
not_available lf l report it stolen and she uses it, they'll arrest her.
not_available Would that be so bad? The last time Chloe moved in with me, she stayed for months.
not_available Well, you could have told her no.
not_available l tried to.
not_available She's my sister and l care about her.

not_available Well, l could recommend someone.
not_available We tried, she won't go.
not_available l'll introduce you as my boyfriend.
not_available Your boyfriend, is that what l am? This is my sister, Div.
not_available Look, it's a bad.
not_available lt's a bad idea.
not_available Why? What if she asks me what l do? You want me to lie to her? Damn right.
not_available What if l tell you something you don't want to hear? Like what? 
not_available l don't know.
not_available Like your Uncle Bob molested her as a child.
not_available We don't have an Uncle Bob.
not_available l'm sorry, but this is just an awful idea.
not_available And l'm not gonna allow you to talk me into it.
not_available Time to feed the animals.

not_available No, l'm not.
not_available Fine.
not_available l'll do it on my own.
not_available He went into asystole.
not_available But you can't anticipate that.

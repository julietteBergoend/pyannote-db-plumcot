not_available Get out before he changes his mind.
not_available Move the transducer down to visualize the adnexa.
not_available ls that the ovary?

not_available But we need to remove the other before it ruptures.
not_available lf that happens you could die.
not_available l'm sorry, Arlene.
not_available Don't be.
not_available l'm having a baby and l'm gonna be just fine.

not_available Maybe you should lock your door.
not_available You cured his hiccups.
not_available l feel much better.
not_available l should probably go over the test results with you alone.
not_available No, go ahead.
not_available We don't have any secrets.
not_available You have some potentially serious findings in your CTs and ultrasound.
not_available How serious? These are abscesses, pockets of bacteria invading your liver.
not_available lt's inflaming your diaphragm which caused your hiccups.
not_available We'll have to admit you and treat you with lV antibiotics.
not_available l see.
not_available That will cure him, right? 
not_available l hope so.
not_available l need to ask you some difficult questions.
not_available Okay.
not_available ln cases when an apparently healthy young individual like yourself has such an unusual illness we need to consider the causes.
not_available Have you ever used lV drugs? 
not_available Never.
not_available Have you had unprotected sex with men, prostitutes? Are you suggesting l have AlDS? lt's an unusual condition and it's sometimes seen in HlV.
not_available lt's probably just a bacterial infection but l needed to consider the risk factors.
not_available l can't believe you're telling me this.
not_available You didn't answer my other question about other sexual contacts.
not_available No, never.
not_available What do you think of Wild Willie?

not_available l hear he's promoting Carter to chief of surgery.
not_available Uh
not_available huh.
not_available Are you getting any sleep at all? Mark? What? 
not_available You didn't hear anything l said.
not_available Sorry.
not_available You have to let this OB case go.
not_available Could've happened to any one of us.
not_available lt's upsetting to kill a patient.
not_available You did all you could to save her.
not_available Tell that to her husband.
not_available When that little boy takes his first steps, his mother won't be there.
not_available His mother will never be there.
not_available lt's not your fault, Mark.
not_available lt's my stop.
not_available Come to my place.

not_available Vascular clamp.
not_available Rib spreaders.
not_available Where is that little gusher? Got it.
not_available lt's clamped.
not_available Heart's beating.
not_available That's teamwork.
not_available lt's fibrillating.
not_available Carter, ever felt a live heart? Make like a crocodile.
not_available Now gently compress the heart between your fingers.
not_available About 80 times a minute.
not_available Feels like a bag of worms.
not_available A couple more units of blood.
not_available lt's filling.

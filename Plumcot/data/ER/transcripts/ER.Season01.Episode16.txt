not_available Lying on that gurney, not knowing whether you're gonna live or die and seeing the face of this lovely, young resident hovering over you.
not_available Well, l can understand how it must've been very scary for you.

not_available Maybe you need a change of pace.
not_available How about a nice, greasy trauma? Sunnyside up or over
not_available easy? l can offer you both.
not_available Okay, but how long do l have to wait? That's the beauty of it.
not_available You don't.

not_available l didn't want to fight, but he kept coming at me.
not_available Move your thumb.
not_available Now your wrist.
not_available He kept jabbing me.
not_available You shouldn't disrespect your mother.
not_available Where is the son of a bitch? l'm sure he's on his way.

not_available We're gonna take this out in surgery.

not_available We're gonna check you out.
not_available Where are we gonna put him? 
not_available Admitting him straight upstairs.
not_available Haleh, could you tell those two hookers that their friend is doing fine? l think they'd rather talk to a doctor.

not_available Nice try.

not_available Mark, chopper on the way.
not_available Some woman choked on her Valentine's dinner.
not_available l said l couldn't.
not_available That l was doing something with you.
not_available You dragged me into it.
not_available Mark, he's married.
not_available Yeah? Well, so am l.
not_available You're looking better, Jake.
not_available Are you feeling better? No.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross tells me you're a very good basketball player.
not_available Yes, l am.
not_available l'm probably better than he is, except he's older.
not_available ls he divorced? 
not_available What? My mom says divorced people have baggage.
not_available Well, he isn't divorced.
not_available Then he doesn't have baggage.
not_available Well, l wouldn't say that exactly.
not_available He's faking.
not_available How can you know that? Because he has that moany voice like when he wants to stay home from school.
not_available Could be appendicitis
not_available He's done this before.
not_available Faked illness? 
not_available No, tried to set me up with single men.
not_available What? He likes you.
not_available l'm his mother, and he's stuck with me.
not_available He thinks if he can get us to spend time together, we will naturally, you know.
not_available Well, that's.
not_available Obviously ridiculous.
not_available Obviously.
not_available And he's done this before? l've been through 5 or 6 departments here alone.
not_available Not to mention hardware stores.
not_available Jake feels l should either be with a doctor or a man who knows his way around nuts and bolts.
not_available So how do you suggest we handle this? Let's cut him open.
not_available The kid's faking it.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, test results back on that Russian girl.

not_available You know what? l'm going to.
not_available l'm gonna have to take a look at this arm.
not_available l don't suppose you remember if you're allergic to lidocaine or Novocaine? Some of the wives don't bother.
not_available Okay.
not_available Well, we're just gonna have to jump in here.
not_available Joe likes his uniform and his collar crisp.
not_available Would you like me to iron your uniform? 
not_available All right.
not_available That'd be great.
not_available How can she do that? 
not_available lt doesn't matter.
not_available lt does to Tatiana.
not_available The situation is what it is.
not_available We'll do what we can.
not_available Well, it isn't much.
not_available We bring down her fever and kick her out? Children and Family Services will
not_available She's got AlDS! She doesn't speak English.
not_available She's barely a candidate as a foster child.
not_available So what do you suggest that we do? 
not_available Anything else.
not_available There isn't anything else.
not_available l know.
not_available You know, these patients come in here for an hour, maybe two maybe a day.
not_available We treat them fast, barely learn their names and then send them home.
not_available Which is usually what they want.
not_available They usually have a home to go to.
not_available Dr.
not_available Ross, you've still got those chickenpox in 3.
not_available Fine, Jerry.
not_available l'm sorry that the person who was with you yesterday isn't here today.

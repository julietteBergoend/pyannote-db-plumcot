sarah_shephard My back was broken .
sarah_shephard They all said it was irreparable .
sarah_shephard And then there was Jack .
sarah_shephard And he promised he would fix me , because that's the kind of guy he is .
sarah_shephard Because you are the most committed man I have ever known -- because you fixed me , I will dance at our wedding .
sarah_shephard To Jack , my hero , Jack .
sunhwa_kwon Give him this -- for the pain .
dr_jack_shephard I think we're a little beyond herbal remedies here .

kate_austen It's not okay .
kate_austen You're having your baby .

dr_jack_shephard That's why you need to ask him again .
sunhwa_kwon Boone , can you hear me ?
sunhwa_kwon What is your blood type ?
sunhwa_kwon Boone , please listen .
sunhwa_kwon What is your blood type ?
dr_jack_shephard Damn it .
sunhwa_kwon Maybe a smaller piece ?
dr_jack_shephard Veins are like a wet noodle -- first you have to find one , then you have to have a hollow needle sharp enough to actually pierce it .
dr_jack_shephard I've got bamboo .
dr_jack_shephard None of it actually even matters because I don't know his blood type , not to mention that his injuries-
boone_carlyle A-negative .
dr_jack_shephard Boone , what'd you say ?
boone_carlyle Shannon , the plane .
dr_jack_shephard Did you hear A-negative ?
dr_jack_shephard Get Charlie --
dr_jack_shephard ask everyone you can find , everyone , what their blood type is .
dr_jack_shephard A negative , okay ?
dr_jack_shephard And find his sister .
dr_jack_shephard Find Shannon .
shannon_rutherford Where are we going ?

shannon_rutherford Oh , okay .
shannon_rutherford Are you lost ?
sayid_jarrah No , absolutely not .
sayid_jarrah Those trees look really familiar .
sayid_jarrah It's this way -- I think .
shannon_rutherford Did you just say I think ?
sayid_jarrah Surprise .
dr_jack_shephard Damn it .
charlie_pace I found an A.
dr_jack_shephard Positive or negative ?
charlie_pace She doesn't know .
charlie_pace I also found two B positives and one AB negative .
charlie_pace At least , he thinks so .
dr_jack_shephard Did you find any O negative ?
charlie_pace Sun said A negative .
dr_jack_shephard Where is she ?
charlie_pace We split up .
charlie_pace I thought she'd be back here .
dr_jack_shephard You only asked 4 people ?
charlie_pace I asked the whole sodding camp -- no one knows their blood type .
charlie_pace I don't know my bloody blood type .
dr_jack_shephard Did you find Shannon ?
sunhwa_kwon No .
sunhwa_kwon I was getting you this .
sunhwa_kwon A hollow needle sharp enough to pierce a noodle .
dr_jack_shephard It's perfect .
charlie_pace Not to rain on your proverbial parade
charlie_pace but I thought you said we needed someone who was A negative .
dr_jack_shephard Or O negative .
charlie_pace Right , which judging by your tantrum , no one is .
dr_jack_shephard Someone is .
charlie_pace You ?
charlie_pace Why'd you make-
dr_jack_shephard O negative is universal donor .
dr_jack_shephard It's in the ballpark , it's not a match .
dr_jack_shephard My blood could put him into anaphylactic shock -- stop his heart .
charlie_pace You mean he'll die .
dr_jack_shephard He's not going to die .
sarah_shephard Those girls are checking you out .
dr_jack_shephard You're in your PJs .
sarah_shephard Indeed I am .
dr_jack_shephard Are they cute ?
sarah_shephard Who ?
dr_jack_shephard The girls that are checking me out .
sarah_shephard Mmm , one of them is kind of cute .
sarah_shephard The other one's just trashy .
sarah_shephard Heart and Soul ?
dr_jack_shephard You got it .
sarah_shephard I'm taking the easy part .
dr_jack_shephard Of course .
sarah_shephard You know you really don't have to do this if you don't want to .
dr_jack_shephard How do you know I haven't ?
sarah_shephard Because you haven't .
sarah_shephard Oh , sorry .
sarah_shephard It was a silly idea .
sarah_shephard I just -- I read too many bridal magazines .
sarah_shephard I think it rotted my brain .
dr_jack_shephard Sarah , I want to .
dr_jack_shephard I'm going to .
dr_jack_shephard I just have to figure out the right way to say it .
sarah_shephard Just vows .
dr_jack_shephard Just vows ?
sarah_shephard Hey , he's going to come .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , I know .
sarah_shephard So , you stay down here as long as you need to .
sarah_shephard And when you're ready I'll be upstairs .
sarah_shephard I cannot wait to marry you Jack Shepard .
jinsoo_kwon Jack , Jack , doctor , Jack !
hugo_reyes Jack .
jinsoo_kwon Claire .
charlie_pace Claire ?
charlie_pace What about Claire ?
sunhwa_kwon He says Claire's with Kate .
sunhwa_kwon She's in labor .
sunhwa_kwon Just off the beach .
charlie_pace Claire's having the baby ?
charlie_pace Where , where ?
sunhwa_kwon He says he thinks she's okay , but she's in pain .
dr_jack_shephard Does he know how fast the contractions are coming ?
sunhwa_kwon Every 2 minutes .
dr_jack_shephard Is she nauseous ?
dr_jack_shephard Can she stand ?
dr_jack_shephard Is there any bleeding ?
dr_jack_shephard Did her water break ?
sunhwa_kwon No , none of that , but she can't move .
charlie_pace We should go .
charlie_pace What do we need -- towels , bandages , hot water ?
charlie_pace How do we take hot water ?
dr_jack_shephard I'm sure you'll figure all that out , alright .
dr_jack_shephard You tell Jin to take Charlie with him and go back to Claire .
charlie_pace Uh , I know .
charlie_pace That , that dilating thing -- how do I look out for that ?
dr_jack_shephard Charlie , listen to me .
dr_jack_shephard Okay , Charlie , look at me .
dr_jack_shephard Tell Kate to wait until the contractions are 60 seconds apart , you got that ?
dr_jack_shephard Now , she's going to need to make sure that Claire pushes , but not too hard , not too fast -- just until the head is clear .
dr_jack_shephard And then , as hard as she can .
dr_jack_shephard When the baby is out make sure she clears
dr_jack_shephard it's nose
dr_jack_shephard and it's mouth .
charlie_pace Yeah ,
charlie_pace but , you'll be there by then , right ?
dr_jack_shephard No , I'm not going anywhere .
dr_jack_shephard I need to stay here .
dr_jack_shephard Now , you tell Kate she's going to have to deliver this baby .

dr_jack_shephard What if I can't be the husband , or the father , that I want to be ?
dr_jack_shephard What if I asked her because I saved her life ?
dr_jack_shephard Should I marry her , dad ?
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Commitment is what makes you tick , Jack .
dr_christian_shephard The problem is you're just not good at letting go .
michael_dawson You're saying Locke lied ?
dr_jack_shephard He didn't fall .
dr_jack_shephard His leg was pinned under something -- something heavy .
michael_dawson Okay , Jack , wait .
michael_dawson The cargo container ?
michael_dawson We've got to do this ?
michael_dawson What about the axe ?
dr_jack_shephard We can't use the axe .
sunhwa_kwon What are you doing ?
dr_jack_shephard The right leg is filling with blood .
dr_jack_shephard If I don't stop it I won't be able to save him .
sunhwa_kwon You don't mean that-
dr_jack_shephard The leg is dead .

minister Jack ?
dr_jack_shephard I didn't write any vows .
dr_jack_shephard I've been trying to for a month , but I couldn't .
dr_jack_shephard So I started to wonder why that was .
dr_jack_shephard And as time went on it only got worse -- because I'm , because I'm not good at letting go .
dr_jack_shephard Or maybe I'm afraid of what'll happen if I fail .
dr_jack_shephard But I know one thing .
dr_jack_shephard I would've never been able to write anything as beautiful as what you just said .
dr_jack_shephard And last night , Sarah , when you were talking about the accident -- you got it all wrong .

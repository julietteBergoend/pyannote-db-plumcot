james_ford Ow, easy, Jackass.
dr_jack_shephard You want it easy, quit moaning. I've got to change these bandages.
james_ford Well, try not taking my skin off with them. How'd I score the house call, Dr. Quinn. Trying to ease your conscience?
dr_jack_shephard My conscience is fine, thanks.
james_ford Of course, what do you have to feel guilty about? I mean, you just let that damn Arab torture me -- stood by and watched. You figure you patch me up -- buy you a ticket into heaven? Only reason you're here...
dr_jack_shephard I'm here because no one else wants anything to do with you.
james_ford She does.
dr_jack_shephard Change your own bandages.
dr_jack_shephard Looking for someone, or just admiring the view?
kate_austen It's been two days since Sayid took off on his own. I keep looking up, thinking I'm going to see him coming back.
dr_jack_shephard He'll come back when he's found what he's looking for -- the French transmission.
kate_austen He isn't looking for anything. He left because of what happened -- for what he did.
dr_jack_shephard It was an accident.
kate_austen Well, accidents happen when you torture people, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid's a trained soldier, Kate. He can take care of himself.
sayid_jarrah Hello? Hello?
.#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode09
dr_jack_shephard What's going on out there?
hugo_reyes Uh, you know, the usual -- people yelling at each other over nothing.
sullivan (a redshirt) Doc, what do you think this is, this, this, this, uh, rash. It's bad, right, like some kind of a tropical disease?
dr_jack_shephard It's hives.
sullivan What's that? Is that like poison ivy?
dr_jack_shephard It's a common rash, Sullivan. It's brought on by heat and stress.
sullivan Okay.
dr_jack_shephard Just try to relax; it'll clear up.
sullivan Right.
dr_jack_shephard Try to keep your mind off it.
sullivan Okay, What is that? Is it like aloe? Isn't that for sunburn, or something?
hugo_reyes Try to keep your mind off it? What else has that guy got to do but stress?
dr_jack_shephard I've got enough on my plate without having to treat hypochondriacs.
hugo_reyes Yeah, but that's like my point, man. We're all fried. I'm mean, have you taken a look at everybody out there? Everybody's way tense. Dude, I'm just saying, it'd be sweet if we could have, I don't know, something to do.
dr_jack_shephard We're surviving here Hurley, and that's what my main concern is, keeping us alive. Things could be worse.
hugo_reyes How?
sayid_jarrah What? Who are you?
danielle_rousseau Where is Alex?
sayid_jarrah I don't know what you're talking about.
danielle_rousseau Where is Alex?
sayid_jarrah Please listen...
danielle_rousseau Where is Alex?
sayid_jarrah I don't know any Alex.
sayid_jarrah Stop!
prisoner Stop.
sayid_jarrah And all the pain will stop. Your Shiite friends have already implicated you in the bombing. You planted the device in the Baathist headquarters, didn't you? You killed two soldiers. Confess it. Confess it, and perhaps it will only cost you your hands instead of your life.
sayid_jarrah He doesn't know anything. Your sources were wrong.
omar Perhaps. But that's really not the point, is it? You handled yourself very well in there.
sayid_jarrah Did I?
omar I'll put in for your reassignment to Intelligence Division, if you wish it.
sayid_jarrah Yes, sir, very much so.
omar Good, now stop calling me sir when it's just the two of us.
sayid_jarrah You're my superior officer, Omar -- for now.
omar And I'll enjoy it while it lasts.
omar That reminds me, Sayid. In addition to your increased responsibility... Communications officer...
sayid_jarrah I'm willing to make that sacrifice.
dr_ethan_rom Hi
hugo_reyes Yo. What's this?
john_locke They were in the jungle. They must have fallen from the plane.
hugo_reyes What are you guys doing out in the jungle at night?
dr_ethan_rom Best time to hunt.
john_locke Ethan here has some experience -- spotted some tracks, looked like they might be rabbit or some other rodent.
hugo_reyes Rodent, yum.
dr_ethan_rom Figured people are starting to get tired of eating boar meat.
hugo_reyes You got that right. Alright, well, I'll take a look at these , and see if there's anything useful.
dr_ethan_rom Okay.
walt_lloyd Mr. Locke, are you going back out to hunt?
john_locke For a bit.
walt_lloyd Can I go with you? I mean, I just want to learn how to do what you do-
michael_dawson Walt!
walt_lloyd I was just. I was talking to Mr. Locke and...
michael_dawson I know what you're doing. It's not going to happen, man. Get back to bed.
hugo_reyes Whoa, dude.
sayid_jarrah Please just listen to me! I keep telling you I don't know who Alex is! I'm a survivor of a plane crash. I found a wire on the beach, I followed it. I thought it might have something to do with the transmission we picked up on our receiver. A recording, a mayday, with a French woman repeating on a loop for 16 years.
danielle_rousseau Si quelqu'un m'entend, je vous en prie, venez à notre aide... Il les a tués. Il les a tous tués... 16 years. Has it really been that long?
sayid_jarrah You.
danielle_rousseau You just happened to hear my distress call? I know what you are.
sayid_jarrah Rousseau.
danielle_rousseau How do you know my name?
sayid_jarrah I read it. There, on the jacket.
sayid_jarrah What is this place? Those batteries -- they wouldn't be able to produce enough power to transmit your distress call all these years.
danielle_rousseau It broadcasts from somewhere else. But they control it now.
sayid_jarrah They?
danielle_rousseau You. And the others like you.
sayid_jarrah I don't know who you think I am. I've already told you I'm not...
danielle_rousseau Sayid?
sayid_jarrah How do you know my name?
danielle_rousseau My name was on a jacket, your's is on the envelope you carry. Who is she? The woman in the photographs.
sayid_jarrah Nadia. Her name is Nadia.
omar We cannot tie Noor Abed-Jazeem directly to the bombing, but we know where her sympathies lie. She's a known associate of Kurdish and Shiite insurgents.
sayid_jarrah You think she knows who orchestrated the bombing?
omar That, my friend, is exactly what you will find out.
sayid_jarrah Noor Abed-Jazeem, I'm going to ask you some questions. If you refuse to cooperate I'm going to hurt you. Do you understand?
noor_abed_jaseem Nobody calls me Noor, Sayid. You of all people should know that.
noor_abed_jaseem What? You don't remember me? Am I so different from the little girl in the school yard who used to push you in the mud?
sayid_jarrah Nadia?
noor_abed_jaseem And your mother would tell my mother, "why must you pick on little Sayid." And I'd answer, because he ignores me.
sayid_jarrah You had enough attention with your family's wealth and your charm.
noor_abed_jaseem Such things matter little to children. But then you always were older than your years, weren't you, Sayid?
sayid_jarrah Not old enough to understand that being pushed in the mud was a sign of affection. Now you're a traitor to your country. Tell me what you know about the bombing in Najaf. Tell me, or I swear I will hurt you.
noor_abed_jaseem Oh, I know Sayid. This is not my first interrogation by the Republican Guard. This is where they burned me with acid -- they pierced my hands with a drill. Would you like to see the soles of my feet? Where they flayed the skin off? These are the handiworks of your friends. The people you swear allegiance to.
sayid_jarrah If you were innocent, I am sorry. But this bombing is a different matter, Nadia.
noor_abed_jaseem Go on, Sayid, do your work. I'm not going to tell you anything.
sayid_jarrah Then I'm going to hurt you.
noor_abed_jaseem I know.
danielle_rousseau You have a bullet wound.
sayid_jarrah I was a soldier.
danielle_rousseau You were. And are you still?
sayid_jarrah That was a long time ago.
danielle_rousseau Tell me more about her, the woman -- Nadia.
sayid_jarrah Alex. Who is he?
walt_lloyd I'm bored. Can I take Vincent to the beach?
michael_dawson I'll take you later, man. I'm in the middle of something.
walt_lloyd But there's nothing to do around here.
michael_dawson Well, you've got to figure out stuff to do. You know what I'm saying? You've got to find a way to entertain yourself.
hugo_reyes Come on. Come on. I know I saw it. Yes.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, uh...
hugo_reyes Hold on, man. I'm busy.
hugo_reyes Dude, can I borrow this?
michael_dawson What?
hugo_reyes Thanks, man.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, what are you doing?
danielle_rousseau So, you heard my transmission -- came looking for me, for answers?
sayid_jarrah I didn't know you were alive.
danielle_rousseau Still lying.
sayid_jarrah I'm not lying.
danielle_rousseau Lies!
sayid_jarrah Nothing...
danielle_rousseau Like this plane crash which you survived. You claim there were others?
sayid_jarrah More than 40, yes.
danielle_rousseau Then why are you alone?
sayid_jarrah I left them.
danielle_rousseau Why?
sayid_jarrah There was -- I did something, something I'm ashamed of.
danielle_rousseau But Nadia, you left her, too?
sayid_jarrah She wasn't on the plane. She's dead -- because of me.
danielle_rousseau I'm so sorry. I want to show you something.
michael_dawson See, this junction here -- re-route some of the spring's water flow into a couple of suspended basins, pop in some hose, you got showers. This way you keep the drinking water separate.
dr_jack_shephard This is -- you drew this?
michael_dawson I was an artist in a previous life.
dr_jack_shephard I thought you were in construction.
michael_dawson I am. I mean, I was -- long story.
charlie_pace Hey, Jack. Hurley's all worked up about something, said we should come see it.
hugo_reyes Welcome, to the first, and hopefully last, Island Open.
dr_jack_shephard What?
hugo_reyes It's two holes for now, 3 par, and no waiting.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, you built a golf course?
hugo_reyes Rich idiots fly to tropical islands all the time to whack balls around.
michael_dawson All the stuff we've got to deal with, man -- this is what you've been wasting your time on?
hugo_reyes Dudes, listen. Our lives suck. Everyone's nerves are stretched to the max. I mean, we're lost on an Island, running from boars and monsters -- freakin' polar bears!
michael_dawson Polar bears?
charlie_pace You didn't hear about the polar bear?
hugo_reyes Look, all I'm saying is, if we're stuck here, then just surviving's not going to cut it. We need some kind of relief, you know. We need some way that we can, you know, have fun. That's right, fun. Or else we're just going to go crazy waiting for the next bad thing to happen.
danielle_rousseau It's a music box, but it's broken. It has been for a long time. It was a gift from my love for our anniversary.
sayid_jarrah You mean Alex?
danielle_rousseau Robert. This was such a comfort to me in the first few years here.
sayid_jarrah I could fix it for you. I could take a look at it, if you freed my hands. I'm very good with mechanical things. I need my hands.
danielle_rousseau What is written on the back of your photograph?
sayid_jarrah What are you doing?
danielle_rousseau Did she write it? Or did you? Perhaps you don't want to tell me because it causes too much pain.
sayid_jarrah Rousseau, you don't need to do that.
michael_dawson This is a problem, man.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
michael_dawson I mean, I know what I'd do, but it's got to be your call.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, give me a seven iron.
michael_dawson You got it.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, heads up over there!
charlie_pace No chance, you won't get anywhere near us!
sullivan Hey, Doc? There you are. Somebody said you went this way. Listen, that rash of mine, it's starting to spread. It's like the size of a grape. What are you guys doing? Are you playing golf?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
sullivan Can I play?
danielle_rousseau Sorry about the sedative. It was the only safe way for me to move you. You offered to fix my music box after all I've done to you -- striking you, shocking you. Why?
sayid_jarrah Do you want me to fix your music box, or don't you?
danielle_rousseau Yes. Yes, please.
sayid_jarrah Then I want to know your name. Your first name.
danielle_rousseau Danielle. My name is Danielle.
sayid_jarrah And how did you come to be on this Island, Danielle?
danielle_rousseau We were part of a science team.
sayid_jarrah A science team armed with rifles? Was Robert on the team?
danielle_rousseau Yes.
sayid_jarrah And Alex, was he, too?
danielle_rousseau Our vessel was 3 days out of Tahiti when our instruments malfunctioned. It was night, a storm, the sounds. The ship slammed into rocks, ran aground, the hull breached beyond repair. So, we made camp, dug out this temporary shelter. Temporary. Nearly 2 months we survived here, 2 months before --
sayid_jarrah Your distress signal? The message I heard, you said, "It killed them all."
danielle_rousseau We were coming back from the Black Rock. It was them. They were the carriers.
sayid_jarrah Who were the carriers?
danielle_rousseau The others.
sayid_jarrah What others? What is the Black Rock? Have you seen other people on this Island?
danielle_rousseau No, but I hear them. Out there, in the jungle. They whisper. You think I'm insane.
sayid_jarrah I think you've been alone for too long.
sayid_jarrah I'm sorry, this is all I could find. I'll try and bring you some fruit later on. Are you ready to talk?
noor_abed_jaseem That depends on what you'd like to talk about, Sayid. Books, weather? Since I've seen neither locked in this cell for weeks, I'm afraid my conversation will suffer.
sayid_jarrah We have two suspects in custody. Have a look at these photographs. All you need to do is nod. If you prove you are willing to cooperate, I think I can get them to free you.
noor_abed_jaseem Then I won't have these visits to look forward to anymore.
sayid_jarrah This isn't a game, Nadia.
noor_abed_jaseem Yet, you keep playing it, Sayid -- pretending to be something I know you're not.
boone_carlyle You're never going to believe this.
shannon_rutherford You finally learned how to tie your own shoes?
boone_carlyle Funny. Someone at the caves built a golf course.
shannon_rutherford Are you high?
boone_carlyle Seriously, a golf course. Apparently, Jack's playing with them right now.
kate_austen Jack? Is golfing?
boone_carlyle That's what I hear. I don't know about you guys but I'm going to go check this out.
shannon_rutherford Wait for me, bonehead.
james_ford Doctor playing golf. Woo, boy howdy, now I've heard everything. What's next, cop eating a donut?
kate_austen You want to come you should just say.
james_ford I think I'll pass on that, Freckles. Not big on crowds. And let's face it, the crowd's not too hot on me, either.
kate_austen One outcast to another -- I'd think about making more of an effort.
james_ford Duly noted.
sayid_jarrah You see, some things can be fixed.
danielle_rousseau Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
sayid_jarrah Danielle, please let me go.
danielle_rousseau Go?
sayid_jarrah Back to the people I told you about.
danielle_rousseau You can't. You have to stay. It's not safe.
sayid_jarrah Not safe, what's not safe?
danielle_rousseau You need me! You can't leave.
sayid_jarrah Danielle...
sayid_jarrah Where are you going?
danielle_rousseau If we're lucky, it's one of the bears.
sayid_jarrah If we're lucky? It might be that thing out there -- the monster.
danielle_rousseau There's no such thing as monsters.
omar You have to execute her.
sayid_jarrah What?
omar The Jazeem woman has given us nothing. This will send a message to the others who will not talk.
sayid_jarrah I just need more time with her.
omar You have had more than a month, Sayid. Now bring her outside and shoot her. Or I will. Is this a problem?
sayid_jarrah No, it's not a problem.
omar Good.
noor_abed_jaseem What did you bring me today?
sayid_jarrah Put it on.
noor_abed_jaseem Are you going to hurt me, Sayid?
charlie_pace Ugh!
hugo_reyes Dude, I think he stuck it.
charlie_pace Lucky, lucky.
kate_austen This thing have a ladies team?
dr_jack_shephard Hey, when did you show up?
kate_austen A while ago. I almost didn't recognize you. You're smiling.
dr_jack_shephard I'll have to watch that.
kate_austen So how'd you come up with this?
dr_jack_shephard Wasn't me -- it's all Hurley. I've been going crazy trying to make everyone feel safe. I haven't been sleeping because I want everyone to feel safe. And he builds a golf course and everyone feels safe.
hugo_reyes Aw, crap, do over.
charlie_pace It's a mulligan, mulligan. It's a gentleman's sport, you've got to get the words right. Mulligan.
walt_lloyd Dad.
michael_dawson Hey, come here. Check this out.
charlie_pace You want to -- let me.
hugo_reyes Dude, get away from me.
walt_lloyd You left me alone at the caves.
michael_dawson What? I left you with Claire.
walt_lloyd She's sleeping.
michael_dawson Oh, man. I'm sorry. I just... I just got caught up. I'm really sorry Walt. I screwed up. I'll make it up to you. Hey, you want to play?
walt_lloyd Nah, there's other people waiting.
michael_dawson Oh no, don't worry about it, they won't mind. You want to take a swing?
charlie_pace Michael, it's your shot. You're up.
michael_dawson Oh, okay, cool. So we'll play later, okay?
sayid_jarrah Put the gun down, Danielle. Put it down on the ground.
sayid_jarrah Don't.
sayid_jarrah I'll take it from here.
noor_abed_jaseem What's... what's going on?
sayid_jarrah 40 meters outside this door there's a supply truck that will be leaving shortly. They don't check them on the way out, only coming in. Get inside. Cover yourself any way that you can. They won't reach the city for 30 minutes, that's enough time for you to jump out and hide yourself.
noor_abed_jaseem Come with me.
sayid_jarrah I can't. Desertion. They would kill my family. I don't have your courage.
noor_abed_jaseem You have more than you know.
sayid_jarrah Nadia, you have to go.
omar Sayid. What are you doing?
sayid_jarrah Don't.
omar Guards!
noor_abed_jaseem Sayid, now you have to come with me! They'll kill you!
sayid_jarrah No, you escaped, you stole my gun and you shot him. And then you shot me.
noor_abed_jaseem Sayid!
sayid_jarrah Take it. Please, Nadia. Take it and go.
sayid_jarrah Please, I don't wish to hurt you.
danielle_rousseau You already have.
sayid_jarrah Don't.
danielle_rousseau The firing pin has been removed. Robert didn't notice it was missing, either -- when I shot him.
sayid_jarrah But you loved him.
danielle_rousseau He was sick.
sayid_jarrah Sick?
danielle_rousseau It took them, one after the other. I had no choice. They were already lost.
sayid_jarrah You killed them?
danielle_rousseau What would have happened if we were rescued? I couldn't let that happen. I won't!
sayid_jarrah I'm not sick.
danielle_rousseau I know.
sayid_jarrah Then why kill me?
danielle_rousseau I can't let you go. Don't you understand, to have someone to talk to, to touch --
sayid_jarrah "You'll find me in the next life if not in this one."
danielle_rousseau What?
sayid_jarrah The writing on the back of Nadia's photograph. I know what it's like to hold on to someone. I've been holding on for the past 7 years to just a thought, a blind hope that somewhere she's still alive. But the more I hold on, the more I pull away from those around me. The only way out of this, this place, is with their help. Come with me. You don't have to be alone, Danielle.
danielle_rousseau Your people -- the ones you're determined to get back to -- watch them, watch them closely.
sayid_jarrah Danielle, who is Alex?
danielle_rousseau Alex was my child.
charlie_pace Guys, please. I've never made par on a course before.
hugo_reyes Dude, you were robbed.
charlie_pace Bollocks. See that?
michael_dawson Okay, Jack. It's up to you. Sink this you get to wear the blazer.
kate_austen No pressure.
charlie_pace Yeah, no pressure.
hugo_reyes 5 bucks says he sinks it.
charlie_pace Hey, you're betting against me?
hugo_reyes Sorry, dude, but you're a duffer like me.
boone_carlyle Make it 10 and you're on.
sullivan I don't have any cash, but I'll bet my dinner on the Doc.
james_ford I've two tubes of sunscreen and a flashlight says he chokes.
kate_austen I'll take that action.
boone_carlyle Yeah, yeah, me too.
shannon_rutherford You just bet on Jack, dumb-ass.
boone_carlyle We need the sunscreen, Princess.
john_locke Does your father know you're here?
walt_lloyd Can you teach me how to do that?

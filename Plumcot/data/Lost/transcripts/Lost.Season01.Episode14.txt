susan_lloyd Somebody's got it all figured out .
michael_dawson Yeah , I'll get back to painting eventually .
michael_dawson Meanwhile , you can support me and Walt in a manner to which we'll soon become accustomed .
susan_lloyd Walt , huh ?
michael_dawson I'd like to do that , you know , name him after my dad .
susan_lloyd Walter .
susan_lloyd Walter Lloyd .
michael_dawson Lloyd ?
michael_dawson Oh , all right .
michael_dawson That's why you won't marry me .
michael_dawson It's not that you think marriage is too prosaic
michael_dawson , you just want him to have your last name .
susan_lloyd Hey , you want me to agree to Walter , or what ?
walt_lloyd Man , I suck .
john_locke You can do better than that .
boone_carlyle You might want to take it easy on him .
john_locke See this knot , Walt ?
john_locke I want you to aim for it , right here .
john_locke Focus on it , alright ?
john_locke Picture it in your mind's eye .
john_locke You know what that is , right ?
john_locke The mind's eye ?
walt_lloyd Like a picture in your head or ...
john_locke That's right .
john_locke Now do it again .
john_locke But see it .
john_locke See it before you do it .
john_locke Visualize the path .
john_locke See it .
john_locke See it .
boone_carlyle Whoa .
walt_lloyd Yes !
john_locke I knew you had it in you , Walt .
walt_lloyd It was weird .
walt_lloyd I actually saw it , in my mind or something , like it was real .
john_locke Who's to say it wasn't ?
michael_dawson Hey !
michael_dawson What the hell is going on ?
michael_dawson Give me that .
walt_lloyd But , I was ...
michael_dawson Take Vincent and go back to camp .
walt_lloyd But , Mr . Locke was ...
michael_dawson Now , little man .
michael_dawson You gave my boy a knife ?
john_locke You should have seen what ...
michael_dawson Hey , don't tell me what I should have seen , man !
michael_dawson If we were back home , I'd call the police on your ass !
michael_dawson Encouraging a kid to sneak away from his parent? !
michael_dawson Giving him a knife like this? !
john_locke Walt knows his own mind .
michael_dawson Hey , don't talk about my son like you know him !

michael_dawson You keep playing my son against me , and I'm going to have a-
boone_carlyle The man said calm down .
michael_dawson What are you his attack dog ?
john_locke Easy , easy , easy .
john_locke You're the one that was waving the knife around .
john_locke He was just trying to make sure you didn't hurt someone .
john_locke Michael , I know it's been difficult to bond with your son .
john_locke You know why he's formed an attachment to me ?
john_locke Because I treat him like an adult .
john_locke You still treat him like a boy .
michael_dawson He's 10 years old .
john_locke He's been through more than most people in their entire lifetimes .
john_locke Maybe you haven't spent enough time with him to see it , but he's different .
michael_dawson What did you say ?
john_locke And we're not back home , Michael .
john_locke As long as we're here , I think Walt should be allowed to realize his potential .
michael_dawson Stay away from my son .
michael_dawson And me .
michael_dawson You're not taking him .
michael_dawson You're not taking my son .
michael_dawson You can go if you want to , but Walt stays with me .
susan_lloyd I'm trying to have a discussion with you .
michael_dawson No you're not .
michael_dawson You're talking about going to Amsterdam , just you and him .
michael_dawson How is that a discussion ?
susan_lloyd It's an offer , Michael .
susan_lloyd And that's where the job is .
michael_dawson You said you were happy .
michael_dawson What about the legal clinic being a good fit ?
michael_dawson You said that ...
susan_lloyd This is a huge opportunity .
susan_lloyd You know I've always wanted to do international law .
michael_dawson Am I supposed to be happy for you over here ?
michael_dawson For your huge opportunity ?
susan_lloyd We've talked about taking some time apart .
michael_dawson Look , babe , I thought that was --
michael_dawson hey , we said a lot of things .
michael_dawson You said you wanted to live on a boat .
susan_lloyd I still love you .
susan_lloyd You know , I do ,
susan_lloyd but , Michael , we've been through so much in such a short time .
susan_lloyd Things ...
michael_dawson Babe , we've got problems , right
michael_dawson , that's what people have .
michael_dawson You want to go to counseling ?
michael_dawson I'm down with that , let's go , alright ?
michael_dawson Oh , man , you already took it , didn't you -- the job ?
susan_lloyd Yeah , I did .
susan_lloyd You haven't worked in months .
michael_dawson Construction slows in the winter -- I already told you that .
susan_lloyd I can provide for him .
susan_lloyd I'll give him everything he needs .
michael_dawson Except for his dad .
michael_dawson He's not going with you , so , no !
susan_lloyd You really want to argue with me about this ?
michael_dawson Hell
michael_dawson yes !
michael_dawson There are laws against this kind of thing .
susan_lloyd We're not married , Michael .
susan_lloyd I'm his mother
susan_lloyd and I'm steadily employed .
susan_lloyd Who do you think court's going to side with ?
susan_lloyd -- This is not goodbye forever .
susan_lloyd I just -- I need some time .
sunhwa_kwon Are you alright ?
michael_dawson No , I'm okay .
michael_dawson Thanks .
michael_dawson I just don't know how to talk him .
michael_dawson How to get him to -- , you know , understand I'm on his side .
michael_dawson Locke says I should stop treating him like a child .
michael_dawson I missed his whole childhood , so -- this can't happen .
sunhwa_kwon What ?
michael_dawson He can't grow up here .
michael_dawson He can't grow up in this place .
sayid_jarrah Once I realized these equations were coordinates , latitude and longitude , I assumed the French woman was trying to determine the location of the Island .
sayid_jarrah But it was incomplete , the notations fragmented .
shannon_rutherford Except for the fish song .
sayid_jarrah MmHmm .
dr_jack_shephard The what ?
sayid_jarrah But when I laid the pages down like this I realized it wasn't showing the location of the Island .
sayid_jarrah I think it's a location on the Island .
sayid_jarrah Specifically , here .
dr_jack_shephard So where are we in relation to the triangle ?
sayid_jarrah Well , the map is hardly in scale , so I don't know .
dr_jack_shephard We're not even sure it's a map of this Island , are we ?
sayid_jarrah We're not , no .
sayid_jarrah But this may be the transmitter sending out the distress call .
sayid_jarrah And its power source .
michael_dawson What are we talking about doing now ?
michael_dawson Looking for another excuse to get chased down and killed by whatever lives in the jungle ?
michael_dawson Guys , we can't keep doing this .
michael_dawson Building water filtration systems ?
michael_dawson Playing golf ?
michael_dawson Making a sweet little home here ?
michael_dawson We need to get off this Island .
shannon_rutherford You think any of us wants to be here ?
michael_dawson No , but I don't think anyone wants to get off as much as I do right now .
dr_jack_shephard So , are you suggesting something ?
michael_dawson Yeah , we build a raft .
sayid_jarrah A raft ?
michael_dawson Look , don't say it like that , man .
michael_dawson We need a little optimism here , okay ?
michael_dawson And we've got to do something because , let's be honest , no one's coming .
michael_dawson Those seats we took off the fuselage , they float .
michael_dawson And we've got an axe , and a whole bunch of trees , bamboo .
michael_dawson We can do this .
sayid_jarrah The chances of surviving the rough waters ?
sayid_jarrah The odds of finding a shipping lane ?
shannon_rutherford And I get really sea-sick .
michael_dawson You know what ?
michael_dawson Great .
michael_dawson Stay here .
michael_dawson Grow old .
michael_dawson Good luck to you , but I'm doing this .
michael_dawson My son and I are leaving .

walt_lloyd I like the pictures .
michael_dawson You like the art , huh ?
walt_lloyd I guess so .
michael_dawson You know , when I was your age , I don't know , maybe a little older , I used to trace comic books .
michael_dawson I taught myself about perspective .
michael_dawson You know what that is -- perspective ?
walt_lloyd Hey !
michael_dawson I said I need your help .
michael_dawson Let's go .
walt_lloyd Why do I have to come ?

michael_dawson You're kidding me , right ?

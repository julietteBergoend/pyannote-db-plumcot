dr_jack_shephard What's going on ?
michael_dawson Look , my kid found these in the jungle .
james_ford And this guy was sitting in the back row of business class , the whole flight , never got up .
james_ford Hands folded underneath the blanket .
sayid_jarrah Oh .
james_ford And for some reason - just pointin' this out -
james_ford the guy sittin' next to him didn't make it .
sayid_jarrah Thank you so much for observing my behavior .
james_ford You don't think I saw them pull you out of line before we boarded ?
james_ford Come on , bring it !
kate_austen Stop !
kate_austen We found the transceiver , but it's not working .
kate_austen Can anybody help ?
sayid_jarrah Yes .
sayid_jarrah I might be able to .
james_ford Oh great .
james_ford Perfect !
james_ford Let's trust this guy !
hugo_reyes Hey !

hugo_reyes Let's treat each other with a little respect .
james_ford Shut up , Lardo .
dr_jack_shephard Hey ! Give it a break .
james_ford Whatever you say , doc .
james_ford You're the hero .
boone_carlyle You guys found the cockpit ?
boone_carlyle Any survivors ?
dr_jack_shephard No .
sayid_jarrah It's dual band , military spec .
sayid_jarrah Chances are , the battery is good , but - the radio is dead .
kate_austen Can you fix it ?
sayid_jarrah I need some time .
rose_nadler Doctor , the ... man with the shrapnel ,
rose_nadler I ...
rose_nadler I think you should take a look at him .
hugo_reyes Tsss .
hugo_reyes Chain-smoking jackass ...
sayid_jarrah Some people have problems .

sayid_jarrah Sayid .
hugo_reyes How do you know to do all that ?
sayid_jarrah I was a military communications officer .
hugo_reyes Oh yeah ?
hugo_reyes You ever see battle ?
sayid_jarrah I fought in the Gulf War .
hugo_reyes No way !
hugo_reyes I got a buddy who fought over there .
hugo_reyes He was in the 104th airborne .
hugo_reyes What were you - Air Force ...
hugo_reyes Army ?
sayid_jarrah The Republican Guard .
kate_austen Is it working ?
sayid_jarrah Seems to be .
sayid_jarrah Except we're not picking up a signal .
kate_austen Why do we need to pick up a signal ?
kate_austen Aren't we trying to send one ?
sayid_jarrah Yes , but what you want to see here is little bars .
sayid_jarrah The bars would show the radio is getting reception .
kate_austen We need the bars .
sayid_jarrah We could broadcast blind ...
sayid_jarrah Hope that someone-maybe a ship somewhere-picks up our distress call .
sayid_jarrah But that could be a waste of the battery , which might not last that long .
sayid_jarrah There is one thing we could try ...
kate_austen What ?
sayid_jarrah Seeing if we can get a signal from high ground .
kate_austen How high ?
kate_austen How is he ?
kate_austen Can you do anything ?
dr_jack_shephard Pull out the shrapnel .
kate_austen But you said yesterday that if you took it out ...
dr_jack_shephard I know .
dr_jack_shephard But that was yesterday .
dr_jack_shephard I was hoping he'd be at a hospital by now .
dr_jack_shephard If I leave him like this , he'll be dead within a day .
dr_jack_shephard If I open him up ... if I can control the bleeding and if he doesn't go into sepsis and if I can find some antibiotics ... he might be all right .
kate_austen I'm going on a hike .
dr_jack_shephard Sorry ?
kate_austen Sayid fixed the transceiver , but we can't use it .
kate_austen Not from here .
dr_jack_shephard Kate , wait a minute .
kate_austen You're the one who said that we had to send out a signal .
dr_jack_shephard Look , you saw what that thing did to the pilot .
kate_austen Yeah , I did .
kate_austen What makes you think we're any safer here than we are in the jungle ?
dr_jack_shephard Wait for me .
dr_jack_shephard I don't know how long this will be ...
kate_austen Sayid said the batteries won't last .
dr_jack_shephard All right .
dr_jack_shephard If you see , or hear , anything ... Anything .
dr_jack_shephard Run .
hugo_reyes What's that ?
hugo_reyes What , that ?
hugo_reyes What , eat that ?
hugo_reyes Dude .

dr_jack_shephard I need any kind of prescription medications you can find .
dr_jack_shephard Especially drugs that end in -mycin and -cillin .
dr_jack_shephard Those are antibiotics .
hugo_reyes What's this for ?
boone_carlyle What are you doing ?
shannon_rutherford I think I was mean to him .
boone_carlyle What ?
shannon_rutherford Isn't that the guy from the gate ?
shannon_rutherford He wouldn't let us have our seats in first class .
shannon_rutherford He saved our lives .
boone_carlyle Come on , Shannon , we're trying to clear some of the wreckage .
boone_carlyle You should help out .
boone_carlyle You're just being worthless over here .
shannon_rutherford I'm being what ?
boone_carlyle What do you want me to say ?
boone_carlyle You're sitting on your ass staring at bodies .
shannon_rutherford I've just been through a trauma here , okay ?
boone_carlyle We've all been through a trauma .
boone_carlyle The only difference is , since the crash , you've actually given yourself a pedicure .
shannon_rutherford You know what ?
shannon_rutherford It is so easy to make fun of me , and you're good at it .
shannon_rutherford I get it .
boone_carlyle I wish I didn't have to waste my time making fun of you .
boone_carlyle I wish I didn't have a reason .
boone_carlyle Yeah , it is easy , Shannon .
shannon_rutherford Screw you , you do not have the slightest idea what I am thinking .

shannon_rutherford The hell I'm not .
boone_carlyle It's what she does .
boone_carlyle She postures .
shannon_rutherford You don't know what the hell I do !
boone_carlyle Makes really bad decisions to upset her family , which , at the moment , is me .
shannon_rutherford Shut up , and stop trying to be charming .
shannon_rutherford I'm coming with you .
kate_austen I don't ... know if that's such a good idea .

james_ford I thought it might come in handy .
james_ford Guess what ?
james_ford I just shot a bear !

sayid_jarrah Don't use the gun .
kate_austen I want to take it apart .
charlie_pace Oh .
sayid_jarrah There's a button on the grip .
sayid_jarrah Push that , it will eject the magazine .

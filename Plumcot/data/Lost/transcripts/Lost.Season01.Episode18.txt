hugo_reyes Hold on a second , you want what now ?
hugo_reyes You want to make snowballs ?
michael_dawson He wants you to hold the bamboo tighter ...
michael_dawson I think .
dr_jack_shephard Hey .
michael_dawson Hey .
dr_jack_shephard How's it coming ?
michael_dawson It's coming .
dr_jack_shephard As long as nobody sabotages this one , as well , huh ?
michael_dawson I've got people standing guard 24-7 .
michael_dawson Nobody gets near this with or without intent to burn .
michael_dawson Hey , listen , I was thinking , chances of a passing ship spotting this raft out there are pretty slim .
michael_dawson We could use something to send out a distress call to any ships that might be close , like an SOS .
dr_jack_shephard Okay , well , look I'll ask Sayid , but even if he can make something like that he's not going to have anything to power it with .
hugo_reyes Didn't Sayid say that crazy French chick has batteries ?
sayid_jarrah Absolutely not .
dr_jack_shephard I'm not asking you to go .
dr_jack_shephard I'll do it .
sayid_jarrah No , you won't .
hugo_reyes Dude , we just trying to-
sayid_jarrah Do you really think she would give up something she needs for survival to a total stranger ?
dr_jack_shephard All I'm asking is for you to tell me how to find her .
dr_jack_shephard That's it .
sayid_jarrah I was brought unconscious to her camp .
sayid_jarrah When I escaped I was disoriented .
sayid_jarrah I don't know how to find her .
hugo_reyes Don't know , dude ?
hugo_reyes Or don't want to ?
dr_jack_shephard Sayid , look , you've got her maps and her papers .
dr_jack_shephard Now you thought that they were pointing to something .
sayid_jarrah Well , I was wrong .
dr_jack_shephard Well , maybe they're pointing to her ?
sayid_jarrah Look !
sayid_jarrah I don't even know what these papers mean .
sayid_jarrah For all I know they could be the ravings of her disturbed mind - song lyrics mixed with equations .
sayid_jarrah If this map is pointing to her , then you should know she resides here , in this area .
sayid_jarrah She gave it a name Territoire Fonce , Shannon translated it .
sayid_jarrah It means dark territory .
sayid_jarrah Does that sound like a place you'd like to visit ?
dr_jack_shephard So , you won't help ?
sayid_jarrah I didn't say that .
sayid_jarrah I'll build a distress beacon , but I suggest you find another power source .
sayid_jarrah There must be something in the cockpit .
dr_jack_shephard We're not going in the cockpit .
carmen_reyes What are you doing in there ?
hugo_reyes Uno momento , Mama , just checking something out .
carmen_reyes I hope you're not watching those g-string mujeres again .
hugo_reyes Look , mom , we've talked about this .
hugo_reyes You want me living here -- you've got to respect my privacy .
hugo_reyes And no , I'm not .

hugo_reyes Hi .
hugo_reyes You awake ?
sayid_jarrah I was just wondering that myself .
hugo_reyes So , that French lady , she wrote this stuff , right ?
sayid_jarrah Hurley , it's the middle of the night .
sayid_jarrah What do you want ?
hugo_reyes Nothing .
hugo_reyes Couldn't sleep , then I got curious .
hugo_reyes You and Shannon , you guys have been trying to figure out some of this stuff
hugo_reyes and I was wondering what , you know , you guys figured out about this stuff .
sayid_jarrah What stuff ?
hugo_reyes I don't know .
hugo_reyes Look , take these numbers she wrote down a bunch of times - got any idea what it means ?
sayid_jarrah I thought at one time they might be coordinates of some kind .
hugo_reyes Coordinates ,
hugo_reyes yeah .
hugo_reyes When you first found her , the French chick , you said you saw a wire or something on the beach ?
hugo_reyes And you followed it , and it led you to her ?
sayid_jarrah No , it led me to a trap she set .
hugo_reyes Her place is probably close , right ?
sayid_jarrah Why are you suddenly so interested in Rousseau ?
hugo_reyes I'm not -- just , you know , making conversation , dude .
hugo_reyes Sorry if it's a bad time .
hugo_reyes Goodnight .
hugo_reyes Yeah , you .
reporter #1

diego Woo !
diego We're rich !
hugo_reyes Nice , dude .
hugo_reyes Ignore him , he's an idiot .
hugo_reyes And , uh , oh , you've got to know this guy .
hugo_reyes This is the greatest guy I know , my , my , my grandpa Tito .
hugo_reyes He's worked 3 jobs for -- how long has it been now ?
grandpa_tito 52 years .
hugo_reyes 52 years .
hugo_reyes 70 years old , and the closest thing he's had to a vacation is when they put a pacemaker in him 4 years ago .
hugo_reyes So the first thing I'm going to do with the money is , uh , finally give him the rest that he's earned .
hugo_reyes That's really what it's all about for me , to be able to do things for the people I care about , because I really put my family through a lot recently , and , um , well , this way I can make it up to them .
hugo_reyes You know , maybe even buy my mom a new house .
hugo_reyes And uh , maybe after my grandpa comes back from his cruise we can , you know -- do some things that we always wanted to do .
hugo_reyes Grandpa ?
charlie_pace Hey , man .

sayid_jarrah I told you , it won't help you find her .
dr_jack_shephard Whoa , slow down .
dr_jack_shephard I don't have the map .
sayid_jarrah What makes this worse is that you don't even do your own dirty work .
sayid_jarrah You get Hurley to do it for you .
dr_jack_shephard Wait a minute -- Hurley ?
sayid_jarrah He was in my tent last night , quizzing me about Rousseau , about numbers she wrote -- how I came to find her .
sayid_jarrah You don't know anything about this , do you ?
dr_jack_shephard Charlie , you seen Hurley ?
charlie_pace A couple of hours ago , he was setting out for a walk .
charlie_pace Acting like a loon , I might say .
sayid_jarrah My god , he's going after her .
shannon_rutherford When are you going to be back ?
sayid_jarrah If we can catch up to him , before nightfall .
sayid_jarrah Why ?
sayid_jarrah You worried about me ?
shannon_rutherford So what if I am ?
dr_jack_shephard Sayid , you ready ?
sayid_jarrah I'll be fine .

hugo_reyes And Diego moving back home after Lisa left him for that .
hugo_reyes . .
hugo_reyes waitress ?

hugo_reyes You're stepping down .
carmen_reyes I can't see anything .
hugo_reyes Okay , now take off your blindfold .
hugo_reyes And get a look at your new dream house .
carmen_reyes Ow , my ankle !
hugo_reyes I said take off your blindfold .

ken_halperin It was destroyed in a fire last month .
hugo_reyes Of course it was .
ken_halperin You might have read about it --
ken_halperin eight something people died .
ken_halperin But , the good news is we over-insured it .
ken_halperin It's going to yield you a windfall of cash .
ken_halperin And , when we add in the generous settlement from the LAPD for your false arrest you've almost doubled your net worth in a few short months .
ken_halperin I still can't imagine how the police mistook you for a drug dealer .
hugo_reyes Bad luck .
ken_halperin Hugo , you are not the first lottery winner to believe the money's brought them nothing but trouble .
ken_halperin It's all in your head .
hugo_reyes What , you don't believe in jinxes ?
hugo_reyes You know , curses ?
ken_halperin I'm an accountant , I believe in numbers .
ken_halperin Hey , where'd you get them , anyway ?
hugo_reyes What ?
ken_halperin The winning numbers .
ken_halperin What'd you use , somebody's birthday , phone number ?
hugo_reyes No , it's nothing , it's something that I . . .
ken_halperin What ?
hugo_reyes That's it .
hugo_reyes It's not the money , it's the numbers .
hugo_reyes The numbers are cursed .
hugo_reyes Dude , don't look at me like that , I'm not crazy .

dr_jack_shephard You never mentioned anything about a bridge .
sayid_jarrah I never saw this before .
dr_jack_shephard There's no way she could have built this all by herself .

martha_toomey If this weren't the middle of nowhere , I'd say you were lost .
hugo_reyes Hi , is this Sam Toomey's house ?
martha_toomey It is .
martha_toomey I'm his wife .
hugo_reyes Is he around , because I'd kind of like to talk to him .
martha_toomey I'd like that , too .
martha_toomey But Sam's been dead for four years .
hugo_reyes Your husband worked with a guy I know , Leonard Sims .
martha_toomey That's right , they served together in the U.S .
martha_toomey Navy .
martha_toomey How is Leonard ?
martha_toomey Still in the service ?
hugo_reyes Uh , he's , um , retired .
hugo_reyes Anyway , he told me about Sam hearing something .
martha_toomey You're talking about the numbers .
hugo_reyes Yes , the numbers , exactly .
hugo_reyes Do you know anything about them ?
martha_toomey Sam and Leonard were stationed at a listening post monitoring long wave transmissions out of the Pacific .
martha_toomey Boring job .
martha_toomey Sam hated it , nothing to do but listen to static night after night .
martha_toomey Until one night , about 16 years ago , there's something in the static , a voice comes through , a voice repeating those numbers over and over again .
martha_toomey A couple of days later we're at the fair in Kalgoorlie and some wally there has got this jar , must have been big as a pony , and it's filled to the rim with beans .
martha_toomey Fella's offering 50 grand to anyone able to guess how many beans are in that jar , within 10 .
hugo_reyes Sam used the numbers ?
martha_toomey Yep , the answer was exact .
martha_toomey To the bean .
martha_toomey Men had been running the same scam for 40 years and nobody had ever come close .
martha_toomey So we won the money .
martha_toomey On the way home a pick-up truck blows a tire on the highway , hits us head on .
martha_toomey Lost my leg that night .
hugo_reyes What about Sam ?
martha_toomey Barely a scratch .
martha_toomey Most people would consider themselves lucky , but not him .
martha_toomey He was never the same after that .
martha_toomey He started keeping a record .
martha_toomey Anything terrible that happened to anyone around us , he believed it was all because he used those numbers .
martha_toomey He moved us out here in the middle of nowhere hoping it would stop .
hugo_reyes Did it ?
hugo_reyes Did he ever find a way to make it stop ?
martha_toomey Yep .
martha_toomey He put a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger .
martha_toomey What is it you're looking for Mr .
martha_toomey Reyes ?
hugo_reyes I used them , the numbers , to win the lottery .
hugo_reyes And now I think I'm under the same curse .
martha_toomey Curse ?
martha_toomey There's no curse .
hugo_reyes But you just told me ...
martha_toomey You think I'd still have my leg if Sam hadn't have picked the right number of beans? !
martha_toomey You think that floods wouldn't have happened? !
martha_toomey That homes wouldn't have burned down? !
martha_toomey That people wouldn't have died? !
hugo_reyes Well , yeah .
martha_toomey You make your own luck , Mr . Reyes .
martha_toomey Don't blame it on the damn numbers .
martha_toomey You're looking for an excuse that doesn't exist .
claire_littleton It's a trap , right ?
claire_littleton For catching animals ?
john_locke Pass me that cup please .
claire_littleton Ugh , what's this gunk ?
john_locke Glue .
claire_littleton Where'd you find glue ?
john_locke I made it out of rendered animal fat .
claire_littleton You made glue ?
claire_littleton Wow .
claire_littleton Then you should have one of those shows where you fix up houses for people .
john_locke I don't think so .
claire_littleton Thanks , for this -- giving me something to do .
claire_littleton I'm tired of trying to remember what happened to me out there .
john_locke How's that coming ?
john_locke Your memory ?
claire_littleton Bits and pieces here and there .
claire_littleton Nothing that makes any real sense .
john_locke Well , maybe I can help .
john_locke I'm good at putting bits and pieces together .
dr_jack_shephard What ?

dr_jack_shephard Hell of a security system .
dr_jack_shephard Somebody trips a wire and the whole place blows up ?
sayid_jarrah There's nothing here .
dr_jack_shephard Batteries ?
sayid_jarrah Nothing .
dr_jack_shephard I don't get it .
sayid_jarrah She knew .
sayid_jarrah She knew that one day I'd come back and bring others .
sayid_jarrah So she abandoned this place , booby-trapped it , and moved on .
dr_jack_shephard Moved on where ?
hugo_reyes Jack !
hugo_reyes Sayid !
charlie_pace Do you even know where we're going ?
hugo_reyes The blast sounded like it came from this way .
hugo_reyes I think .
charlie_pace You don't know .
hugo_reyes Dude , what do you want from me ?
charlie_pace What do I want ?
charlie_pace I want to know what we're doing in the middle of nowhere ?
charlie_pace And don't tell me it's because of some stinking batteries .
charlie_pace One minute you're happy-go-lucky , good time
charlie_pace Hurley and the next
charlie_pace you're Colonel-bloody-Kurtz .
charlie_pace It just doesn't make any sense .
charlie_pace It's not you .
hugo_reyes Dude , you don't know me .
charlie_pace Well , all this time on the Island , you've told me nothing about yourself .
hugo_reyes We've all got personal stuff , dude .
charlie_pace Don't change the subject .
charlie_pace We're lost out here .
charlie_pace Jack and Sayid could be hurt , if not blown to bits , all because you're acting like some bloody nutter .
hugo_reyes I am not crazy .
hugo_reyes I've got my reasons for every-
charlie_pace I think I have a right to know .
hugo_reyes Okay , alright , you want to know ?
charlie_pace Yep .
hugo_reyes About a year ago ... Is someone shooting at us ?
hugo_reyes You must be the French chick .
danielle_rousseau Who are you ?

danielle_rousseau You were on the plane .

hugo_reyes What ?
hugo_reyes You don't know ?
hugo_reyes Okay , that thing in the woods , maybe it's a monster

hugo_reyes The fact that no one is even looking for us ,
hugo_reyes yeah ,
hugo_reyes that's weird , but I just go along with it because I'm along for the ride , good old fun time
hugo_reyes Hurley !
hugo_reyes Well guess what ?
hugo_reyes Now , I want some friggin' answers !
danielle_rousseau Our ship picked up a transmission -- a voice repeating those numbers .
danielle_rousseau We changed course to investigate .
danielle_rousseau After we shipwrecked my team continued to search for the transmission source .
danielle_rousseau It was weeks before we found the radio tower .
hugo_reyes There's a radio tower on this Island ?
danielle_rousseau Yes , up by the Black Rock .
danielle_rousseau Some of us continued to search for the meaning of those numbers while we waited for rescue .
danielle_rousseau But then the sickness came .
danielle_rousseau When my team was gone , I went back up to the tower and changed the transmission .
hugo_reyes The distress signal we heard ?
danielle_rousseau Yes .
hugo_reyes But the numbers -- did you ever find out anything about them ?
hugo_reyes Do you know where they got their power ?
danielle_rousseau Power ?
hugo_reyes They bring bad stuff to everyone around you .
hugo_reyes They're cursed .
hugo_reyes You know that , right ?
hugo_reyes The numbers , they're cursed .
danielle_rousseau The numbers are what brought me here .
danielle_rousseau As it appears they brought you .
danielle_rousseau Since that time I've lost everything , everyone I cared about .
danielle_rousseau So yes , I suppose you're right .
danielle_rousseau They are cursed .
hugo_reyes Thank you .
hugo_reyes Thank you .
hugo_reyes You have no idea how long I've been waiting for someone to agree with me .
hugo_reyes Thank you .
hugo_reyes Oh god , thank you .

claire_littleton Haven't really thought about it .
claire_littleton I was going to give it away , you know , for adoption .
john_locke That must have been a difficult decision .
claire_littleton Yeah , well , it doesn't matter now .
claire_littleton It's my birthday today .
john_locke Why haven't you told anyone ?
claire_littleton I'm pregnant , single , and on an Island in the middle of nowhere .

charlie_pace I know food's scarce , but your shirt ?
hugo_reyes When you find a laundromat , let me know .
charlie_pace Back in the jungle before we became target practice you were going to tell me what inspired this little quest .
hugo_reyes I think the plane crash might have been my fault .
charlie_pace Don't be daft , how could you possibly ...
hugo_reyes Hey , before we came here a lot of bad stuff used to happen whenever I was around .
charlie_pace What do you mean , like bad luck ?
hugo_reyes Yeah , that's -- that would be kind of a mellow way of describing it .
charlie_pace Hurley , bad things happen , planes crash , people die .
hugo_reyes Dude , you gotta let me finish .
charlie_pace You think you're the only person with baggage ?
charlie_pace You know what I was doing when the plane went down ?
charlie_pace I was snorting heroin in the toilet .
charlie_pace I was such a junkie
charlie_pace I couldn't even take a plane ride with out having a fix .
charlie_pace I suppose that was your fault , as well ?
charlie_pace --
charlie_pace So how about it ?
hugo_reyes What ?
charlie_pace I just told you the biggest secret of my life .
charlie_pace I thought you'd want to reciprocate .
hugo_reyes Okay .

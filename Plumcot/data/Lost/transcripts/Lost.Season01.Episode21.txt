sayid_jarrah Is there anything I can do for you ?
sayid_jarrah Sun said he wouldn't let Jack take his leg
sayid_jarrah -- he didn't want him using up the antibiotics .
sayid_jarrah She said he knew what was happening to him -- that he was brave .
AIRPORT#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode21 Heathrow airport authority reminds traveling passengers that safety regulations require ...
agent_alyssa_cole Okay , Sayid , 18 hours in a holding cell should be enough .
agent_alyssa_cole Let's get to it , shall we ?
agent_alyssa_cole I'm Melissa Cole from Central Intelligence , this is Robbie Hewitt from ASIS .
agent_alyssa_cole We're here because you're going to do us a favor .
sayid_jarrah A favor ?
agent_alyssa_cole HEWITT Last week 300 pounds of C-4 explosives were stolen from an army base outside of Melbourne .
agent_alyssa_cole The men responsible are members of a terrorist cell intent on disrupting the coalition presence in Iraq .
agent_alyssa_cole 300 pounds of
agent_alyssa_cole C-4 - I want it back .
sayid_jarrah You're the CIA , plant a few bugs .
agent_alyssa_cole Oh , we have .
agent_alyssa_cole But you're going to get inside for us .
sayid_jarrah I am Iraqi .
sayid_jarrah I am not a terrorist .
agent_alyssa_cole We didn't snatch you up because you are a terrorist , Sayid .
agent_alyssa_cole We snatched you up because you know one .
agent_alyssa_cole HEWITT Essam Tasir , your roommate at Cairo University .
agent_alyssa_cole He's a member of the cell .
sayid_jarrah And why should I care ?
agent_alyssa_cole You'd be saving lives .
sayid_jarrah I repeat , why should I care ?
agent_alyssa_cole Because we know where she is .
agent_alyssa_cole 7 years since you left Iraq -- 6 months here , 3 months there -- always moving .
agent_alyssa_cole There's only two reasons a man would do that , Sayid .
agent_alyssa_cole Either he's running away from something , or looking for something .
agent_alyssa_cole Noor Abed-Jazeem .
sayid_jarrah Nobody calls her Noor .
agent_alyssa_cole You want to know where she is ?
agent_alyssa_cole Then we're going to Sydney .
dr_jack_shephard Kate ?
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing out here ?
kate_austen Looking for you .
dr_jack_shephard Well , you found me .
kate_austen You're walking in circles .
kate_austen You need to come back .
dr_jack_shephard Not without Locke .
kate_austen You haven't slept .
kate_austen You gave Boone your own blood .
dr_jack_shephard Locke lied .
kate_austen Well , now you're-
dr_jack_shephard He lied , Kate .
dr_jack_shephard Boone did not fall off any cliff .
dr_jack_shephard His leg was crushed , and I based my medical treatment on his lie .
kate_austen People are scared and upset .
kate_austen They don't know what's going on .
kate_austen We need you to come back , Jack .
kate_austen Please .
dr_jack_shephard Shannon ?
dr_jack_shephard Do you want to say something ?
shannon_rutherford No .
sayid_jarrah I didn't know Boone very well , and for that I am sorry .
sayid_jarrah On our 6th day here a woman named Joanna died .
sayid_jarrah She drowned .
sayid_jarrah And Boone was the first one into the water .
sayid_jarrah I didn't know him , but I remember his courage .
sayid_jarrah And I know he will be missed .
john_locke It was my fault .
john_locke We found a plane , a Beechcraft , in the jungle .
john_locke It was lodged in the canopy so -- I would have gone up , but I --
john_locke my leg was hurt
john_locke so he -- there was a radio inside
john_locke and he thought he could -- look , his weight must have made the plane shift
john_locke and it fell --
john_locke and -- it happened because he was trying to help us .
john_locke He was a hero .
dr_jack_shephard Where were you ?
dr_jack_shephard Where were you ?
dr_jack_shephard Where the hell were you , you son of a bitch? !
dr_jack_shephard What did you do to him? !
charlie_pace Hey , wait , wait , Jack !
dr_jack_shephard Where were you? !
dr_jack_shephard You left him to die !
dr_jack_shephard You lied to me !
dr_jack_shephard Where were you? !
charlie_pace Jack , okay , it's okay .
dr_jack_shephard Where were you? !
dr_jack_shephard Where were you? !
kate_austen Jack !
kate_austen Jack , what's the matter ?
kate_austen Are you okay ?
kate_austen Are you okay ?
james_ford Get some water !
charlie_pace Breathe .
charlie_pace He's okay .
charlie_pace Just breathe , Jack .
dr_jack_shephard He's lying .
sayid_jarrah You're suffering from fatigue .
dr_jack_shephard Locke told Boone not to tell .
sayid_jarrah Tell about what ?
dr_jack_shephard Something about a hatch .
dr_jack_shephard Locke's hiding something .
sayid_jarrah Jack , lis-
dr_jack_shephard Look , the man is hiding something .
sayid_jarrah Jack , listen to me .
sayid_jarrah What we need is for the one doctor on this Island to get some sleep .
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine .
dr_jack_shephard I don't need it .
kate_austen Jack .
sunhwa_kwon You need some rest .
sunhwa_kwon C'mon .
essam_tasir Sayid !
essam_tasir Sayid , it is you .
sayid_jarrah Essam .
essam_tasir I see you haven't forgotten me .
sayid_jarrah Hardly .
essam_tasir What are you doing in Sydney ?
sayid_jarrah I've been traveling , and you ?
essam_tasir I live here -- almost a year now
essam_tasir -- I'm a tree-cutter .
essam_tasir I cut trees .
sayid_jarrah It sounds like good , honest work .
essam_tasir So much for my philosophy degree , huh ?
sayid_jarrah Whatever puts food on your table .
sayid_jarrah How is Zahra ?
essam_tasir She died -- stray bomb while she was shopping for a dress .
sayid_jarrah I'm so sorry .
essam_tasir Listen , listen , we've got a lot of catching up to do .
essam_tasir Why don't you come over ?
sayid_jarrah I'd love to .
yusef Damn it .
yusef I'm out of ammo .
haddad Use the crowbar .
yusef That only works on the zombies , not the big bugs .
haddad Indeed .
sayid_jarrah The 3 of you live here ?
essam_tasir Sydney's very expensive .
essam_tasir This is the best we can afford .
haddad And what is it you do , Sayid ?
sayid_jarrah At the moment I'm at liberty .
essam_tasir He's on holiday .
essam_tasir You'll love the beaches here .
essam_tasir There's something to be said for Australian women .
sayid_jarrah I've had the misfortune of being landlocked for several years .
sayid_jarrah The last beach I was at was Sharm-el Sheikh with you Essam -- remember , before our English exams ?
sayid_jarrah I hear the beaches here are very nice , especially the women .
sayid_jarrah Perhaps we can go .
sayid_jarrah So tell me exactly what kind of trees do you cut ?
haddad Who are you ?
sayid_jarrah I was a communications officer .
essam_tasir Sayid was Republican Guard .
essam_tasir He knows things .
haddad Perhaps it's not happenstance that you and Essam met at the Mosque .
haddad Perhaps it is fate .
claire_littleton It's okay .
claire_littleton Look , I'm fine , really , okay ?
charlie_pace You need rest , Claire .
charlie_pace Sun , tell her .
sunhwa_kwon In a hospital they would have you sleep .
sunhwa_kwon The nurses would take your baby .
claire_littleton Yeah ,
claire_littleton but I'm not in a hospital .
charlie_pace Well , all the more reason to take extra care , Claire .
charlie_pace Look , it's okay , I can take care of turnip-head for a while .
claire_littleton Turnip-head ?
charlie_pace It's just what I'm calling him until you give him a name because his head -- it's like a turnip .
claire_littleton What if he needs something , okay ?
charlie_pace You'll be there for him -- after you sleep .
claire_littleton No , okay ?
claire_littleton No .
charlie_pace Claire , no one is going to take this baby away from you .
charlie_pace No one .
claire_littleton You don't know that
claire_littleton , okay .
claire_littleton You can't say that .
charlie_pace I won't let anything happen .
claire_littleton Just be really careful
claire_littleton , okay ?
claire_littleton Make sure
claire_littleton if he gets hot that you take his blanket off -- his neck , okay , got his neck ?
charlie_pace Got it .
john_locke This was his .
john_locke I didn't go through it .
shannon_rutherford Thank you .
john_locke Welcome .
john_locke Storm coming .
john_locke I should have said no -- the first time he offered to hunt with me I should have said no .
shannon_rutherford He would have gone anyway .
john_locke Yeah , I suppose he would have .
john_locke I know how confused and angry you must be right now .
john_locke I can't say I understand what you're going through , but I know what it feels like when you lose family .
john_locke I hope you can forgive me .
john_locke I'm sorry .
shannon_rutherford You asked if you could do anything for me .
sayid_jarrah Anything .
shannon_rutherford John Locke killed my brother .
shannon_rutherford Will you do something about that ?
kate_austen Little more .
dr_jack_shephard No .
kate_austen You need to get your blood sugar level up .
dr_jack_shephard Look , enough already .
dr_jack_shephard I've rested .
kate_austen Jack .
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine .
kate_austen Where are you going ?
dr_jack_shephard I'm going to go talk to Locke .
kate_austen You need to lie down .
dr_jack_shephard No , I don't .
kate_austen I strongly advise it .
dr_jack_shephard Advise ?
dr_jack_shephard Advice --
dr_jack_shephard alright , what's going on now ?
kate_austen Lie down , okay .
kate_austen I crushed up some sleeping pills -- put them in your juice .
dr_jack_shephard Why would you -- you drugged me ?
kate_austen Yeah .
dr_jack_shephard Oh , okay .
kate_austen Night .
sayid_jarrah How did you get that ?
john_locke War wound .
sayid_jarrah Looks more like a surgical scar .
john_locke Like I said , war wound .
sayid_jarrah The plane's radio ?
sayid_jarrah Was Boone able to pick up a signal ?
john_locke I was on the ground , all I could here was static .
sayid_jarrah But it was working ?
john_locke Yeah ,
john_locke but I can't imagine it survived the fall .
sayid_jarrah Some of its parts might work in the transmitter I'm building for the raft .
sayid_jarrah If you'd be willing to take me ?
john_locke Of course .
sayid_jarrah How did you find this plane ?
john_locke Luck .
sayid_jarrah You and Boone were hunting .
john_locke Was that a question ?
sayid_jarrah Yes .
john_locke The boar got scarce a couple of weeks back .
john_locke We weren't hunting , we were exploring .
sayid_jarrah So you just happened upon a Beechcraft perched in the trees ?
john_locke Yep .
sayid_jarrah At the funeral you said your leg was injured .
john_locke It was just a charlie-horse .
john_locke A cramp .
sayid_jarrah I know what a charlie-horse is , John .
john_locke Back in Iraq you were an interrogator .
sayid_jarrah Is that a question ?
john_locke Yeah .
sayid_jarrah A long time ago I was .
john_locke Well , you haven't lost your touch .
sayid_jarrah Why would I interrogate you , John ?
john_locke Jack called me a liar in front of every man , woman and child
john_locke I've come to know over the past month .
john_locke Maybe there's a part of you that thinks maybe there isn't a plane out here at all .
sayid_jarrah I know when I'm being lied to .
sayid_jarrah There's a plane .
john_locke Like I said , you haven't lost your touch .
sayid_jarrah You've lost your edge , old man .
essam_tasir I never had one when playing against you .
sayid_jarrah Were you always this slow ?
essam_tasir C'mon , c'mon , let's keep playing .
sayid_jarrah You have to get out of that apartment -- practice more .
essam_tasir Haddad would like that -- more blending in with the community .
sayid_jarrah I think he's got his eye on a target .
essam_tasir What makes you say that ?
sayid_jarrah For the last 2 weeks he's been asking me about explosives -- blast radius , transport .
essam_tasir Haddad's very thorough .
sayid_jarrah Do you know if he's gotten hold of any yet ?
essam_tasir Explosives ?
essam_tasir I don't know .
essam_tasir All I know is there's going to be an operation -- and there is going to be a martyr .
sayid_jarrah You ?
essam_tasir Haddad told me this morning .
essam_tasir C'mon
essam_tasir let's keep playing .
essam_tasir C'mon -- I'll wipe the floor with you .
sayid_jarrah Essam , what is it , huh ?
sayid_jarrah What is it ?
essam_tasir I don't think I can do it .
agent_alyssa_cole You're kidding me , right ?
sayid_jarrah Listen to me , I can get Essam to turn himself in .
sayid_jarrah He wants out .
agent_alyssa_cole Does he know where the C-4 is ?
sayid_jarrah The other two are the ones you want .
sayid_jarrah Essam's confused-
agent_alyssa_cole Does he know where it is ?
sayid_jarrah No .
agent_alyssa_cole Then he's useless .
agent_alyssa_cole These cells run top down .
agent_alyssa_cole It's all need-to-know .
agent_alyssa_cole The recruit's handed a bomb and target at the last possible moment .
agent_alyssa_cole The only way to find that C-4 is to wait for Essam to walk out that door with a target to hit .
sayid_jarrah He's in over his head .
sayid_jarrah He doesn't even know why he's doing it ...
agent_alyssa_cole That's why you're going to convince him to go through with it .
sayid_jarrah No .
sayid_jarrah No , I will not .
agent_alyssa_cole Excuse me ?
sayid_jarrah I'm done .
sayid_jarrah It's over .
agent_alyssa_cole No , no , you're not even close to being done , my friend .
sayid_jarrah What are you going to do ?
sayid_jarrah Arrest me ?
agent_alyssa_cole No , we'll arrest her .
agent_alyssa_cole Your girlfriend's an Iraqi living abroad with a record of insurgency .
agent_alyssa_cole Wouldn't it be terrible if she got picked up as an enemy combatant , Sayid ?
agent_alyssa_cole So , if you want any chance of ever seeing her again you're going to go and talk your good friend Essam into blowing himself up .
charlie_pace The itsy-bitsy spider climbed up the spout , down came the rain and drowned the spider out ...
hugo_reyes Dude , it's washed -- washed the spider out .
hugo_reyes Unless it's some kind of British version ?
charlie_pace Oh , okay .
charlie_pace Down came the rain and washed the spider -- oh , bollocks , shhhh , shhh , shhh .
hugo_reyes What's the matter , man ?
charlie_pace Well , I can't get the bloody thing to stop crying .
hugo_reyes Maybe it's hungry ?
charlie_pace Nope , Claire nursed him 5 times .
hugo_reyes Any deposits ?
hugo_reyes You know , diaper-wise ?
hugo_reyes Alright , it's time to break out the big guns .
hugo_reyes Dude , that's all I got .
sayid_jarrah Heroin .
john_locke The cargo hold's full of it .
john_locke The best I can figure it
john_locke -- they were smugglers .
sayid_jarrah The plane was perched in the canopy ?
john_locke Right up there .
sayid_jarrah And Boone climbed up by himself because of your charlie-horse ?
john_locke Yes , that's right .
sayid_jarrah Why did you lie ?
john_locke I made a mistake .
sayid_jarrah I'm going to salvage what I can of the radio .
sayid_jarrah If we leave now we should beat the storm back .
john_locke Why don't you trust me , Sayid ?
sayid_jarrah For one thing , you've been carrying a gun you've told no one about .
john_locke We found one of the smugglers about a half a click West of here dressed as a priest --
john_locke Nigerian currency in his pockets , and this .
john_locke Now you're armed
john_locke and I'm not .
john_locke Does that earn me any trust ?
sayid_jarrah You gave this to me because I caught you concealing it .
sayid_jarrah That earns you adaptability .
john_locke Okay , I'll tell you something you don't know .
sayid_jarrah Please do .
john_locke The first week after the crash there was a cave in .
john_locke Jack was trapped .
john_locke Do you remember that ?
sayid_jarrah Of course .
john_locke You , Kate and Sawyer went out into the jungle to try and triangulate a signal .
sayid_jarrah Yes .
john_locke You were hit from behind -- knocked unconscious ?
john_locke When you woke up your transceiver , your equipment was destroyed .
john_locke That was me .
sayid_jarrah This is one time you'd better not be telling the truth .
john_locke I did what was in everyone's best interest .
sayid_jarrah You ruined my chance to find the source .
john_locke The source of a distress call that kept saying they're dead , it killed them all , over and over ?
john_locke Is that a place you really want to lead people to ?
sayid_jarrah Why wait all this time ?
sayid_jarrah Why not tell me then ?
john_locke Because back then you wouldn't have engaged in reasonable debate , and nobody else would have .
john_locke You were all so focused on getting off the Island that you weren't seeing things clearly .
john_locke It's like what's happening now with the raft .
sayid_jarrah Did you burn the raft , John ?
john_locke No , Sayid , I didn't .
sayid_jarrah What is the hatch ?
john_locke The hatch ?
sayid_jarrah Boone mentioned it before he died .
john_locke A hatch ?
john_locke Two hatches on a plane , Sayid , could be forward or aft .
essam_tasir I'm not sure if I can do this .
sayid_jarrah You would not be a martyr if you didn't have to overcome fear , Essam .
essam_tasir I'm not afraid to die .
essam_tasir It's all the innocent lives -- all those people .
essam_tasir The Imam preaches peace , Sayid .
essam_tasir Every human life is sacred .
sayid_jarrah It's true , innocent lives will be lost -- in service of a greater good .
essam_tasir What if I'm doing this because I'm angry ?
essam_tasir What if I'm doing this because they killed her ?
sayid_jarrah What if you are ?
sayid_jarrah Should we just accept what happened to Zahra ?
sayid_jarrah Do we just accept their deaths ?
sayid_jarrah Because if we do , it means that ultimately we can do nothing about them .
sayid_jarrah I lost someone , too , Essam .
sayid_jarrah I will never be whole again .
sayid_jarrah There need to be consequences for those responsible .
sayid_jarrah That's my duty .
sayid_jarrah That is how I will honor her .
essam_tasir Haddad was right , it was fate that brought us back together .
essam_tasir Sayid , will you do this with me ?
sayid_jarrah I will .
sayid_jarrah How are you ?
sayid_jarrah Do you want to take a walk ?
shannon_rutherford Sure .
sayid_jarrah I spoke to Locke .
shannon_rutherford What did he say ?
sayid_jarrah He took me to the plane .
sayid_jarrah I believe what happened was an accident .
shannon_rutherford Then why did he lie ?
sayid_jarrah I have no idea .
sayid_jarrah But I don't believe he meant to harm Boone .
shannon_rutherford So that's it ?
sayid_jarrah I know how strong the need can be to find someone to blame .
shannon_rutherford You don't get it , do you ?
sayid_jarrah Shannon .
shannon_rutherford Just forget about it , okay ?
walt_lloyd How much weight can this hold ?
michael_dawson I don't know .
michael_dawson A lot .
michael_dawson Enough .
michael_dawson Yeah ,
michael_dawson yeah , tighter .
michael_dawson Got it .
walt_lloyd What if it tips over ?
michael_dawson It won't .
michael_dawson That's why we made it
michael_dawson this wide .
michael_dawson There , that should do it .
michael_dawson Right ?
michael_dawson Good ?
jinsoo_kwon Good .
michael_dawson Alright .
walt_lloyd What if a shark attacks ?
michael_dawson A shark's not getting anywhere near us , man .
walt_lloyd What if we die ?
michael_dawson We are not going to die .
walt_lloyd Boone died .
charlie_pace Hey , Michael , do you know anything about babies ?
charlie_pace I can't get this little guy to be quiet .
michael_dawson Walk with him , he'll calm down .
charlie_pace Yeah , I tried that .
charlie_pace Hey , Jin , have you seen Sun ?
charlie_pace Sun .
charlie_pace I need some help with this baby .
jinsoo_kwon No .
charlie_pace Okay .
james_ford Hey , Chuckie , want to keep that kid quiet ?
james_ford Baby Huey's like nails on a chalkboard .
charlie_pace Oh , there you go .
charlie_pace You happy now ?
james_ford I was .
james_ford If you're going to play nursemaid , at least do the damn job .
charlie_pace Hey , say something else .
charlie_pace Just say something , say anything .
james_ford Okay , fine .
james_ford I liked that thing a lot better inside than I like it outside .
james_ford What ?
kate_austen Hey -- brought you something to eat .
dr_jack_shephard What's in it , chloroform ?
kate_austen Soup .
dr_jack_shephard Thanks , but I think I'll -- Who was in here ?
kate_austen I don't know , what's the matter ...
dr_jack_shephard Was anybody in here ?
kate_austen No , why are you ...
dr_jack_shephard The key to the gun case , it's gone .
kate_austen Maybe it fell off this morning .
dr_jack_shephard It didn't fall off .
sayid_jarrah What's going on ?
dr_jack_shephard Locke took the key -- he's after the guns .
kate_austen I haven't seen him all day , you don't know that ...
dr_jack_shephard No , then who was it ?
sayid_jarrah Jack , it wasn't Locke .
haddad Sayid , get in .
haddad It's time .
haddad Stay relaxed and focused ; drive with the windows down -- the fresh air will keep you alert .
haddad You will need to wear these .
haddad If you run into any problems use this .
haddad You are heroes .
haddad Good luck .
sayid_jarrah Essam stop .
essam_tasir Don't be nervous , brother .
essam_tasir We'll be okay .
sayid_jarrah I'm working with the CIA .
essam_tasir What ?
sayid_jarrah I'm going to give you 10 minutes to get away before I call them .
essam_tasir You set me up ?
sayid_jarrah Essam , just go .
essam_tasir Why would you do this to me ?
sayid_jarrah You're wasting time .
essam_tasir You said we were going to do this together .
essam_tasir You said you lost someone .
sayid_jarrah Her name is Nadia .
sayid_jarrah We were separated years ago .
sayid_jarrah They know where I can find her .
essam_tasir You used me to find a woman ?
essam_tasir You talked me into this .
sayid_jarrah Essam , don't .
essam_tasir You said it was for the greater good .
sayid_jarrah I'm begging you to go .
essam_tasir You said you were my brother .
essam_tasir You were supposed to be my brother , my friend .
sayid_jarrah I am your friend .
essam_tasir A friend who told me to do this for Zahra just so you could find some woman that you love? !
essam_tasir Well , then , Sayid , I hope she makes you whole again .
sayid_jarrah Essam !
dr_jack_shephard Go !
dr_jack_shephard Go .
john_locke She doesn't believe me , Sayid .
sayid_jarrah Shannon , Shannon , please listen to me .
shannon_rutherford He did it .
shannon_rutherford I know it .
sayid_jarrah You're not thinking rationally .
sayid_jarrah You've never fired a gun before .
sayid_jarrah Shannon , you don't want to do this .
shannon_rutherford Yes , I do !
sayid_jarrah If you do it , you can never take it back .
shannon_rutherford Stay back !
shannon_rutherford What did you do to him? !
john_locke I told you it was an accident .
dr_jack_shephard Shannon .
shannon_rutherford Jack , you told me he was a liar !
sayid_jarrah I'm sorry .
shannon_rutherford Don't .
shannon_rutherford Get away .
sayid_jarrah Shannon .
james_ford The low rumble breaks the crisp fall air as a flash of red streaks down the maple-dappled Vermont highway .
james_ford The 32 valve V-8 engine purrs as the transmission clicks down a gear and the vehicle unleashes all 400 horses and 350 pound feet rear-wheel torque .
charlie_pace Keep going .
charlie_pace Keep going .
claire_littleton Charlie .
james_ford Beneath the hood the 4.4 liter power plant features a fully integrated super-charger made into a 6 speed transmission from the manual sequential shift feature .
charlie_pace Keep going .
james_ford This smooth-riding sports car offers a bewitching blend of taste , comfort and economy .
kate_austen She just needs time .
kate_austen She's been through a lot .
sayid_jarrah Time won't make a difference .
sayid_jarrah Perhaps I made a mistake .
kate_austen You couldn't let her kill Locke .
kate_austen You had no choice .
sayid_jarrah There's always a choice .
agent_alyssa_cole She lives in Irvine , California , just south of Los Angeles --
agent_alyssa_cole works as a lab-tech at a medical testing company -- plane ticket ,
agent_alyssa_cole walking around money , you're on an Oceanic flight to LA .
agent_alyssa_cole It leaves in two hours .
sayid_jarrah What happens to his body ?
agent_alyssa_cole He was a terrorist
agent_alyssa_cole so he's not exactly getting a state funeral .
sayid_jarrah What happens to his body ?
agent_alyssa_cole After it's released ; he'll be cremated .
sayid_jarrah A Muslim man is supposed to be buried .
agent_alyssa_cole Yeah , well , there's no one to claim the body .
sayid_jarrah I'll claim him .
agent_alyssa_cole You can't claim him when you're on a plane in 2 hours , mate .
sayid_jarrah Then change my flight to tomorrow .
sayid_jarrah How's your head ?
john_locke It'll heal .
sayid_jarrah Another war wound .
john_locke I know what it cost you to do what you did .
john_locke Thank you .
sayid_jarrah I did it because I sense you might be our best hope of surviving here .
sayid_jarrah But I don't forgive what you did .
sayid_jarrah And I certainly don't trust you .
sayid_jarrah And now , you're going to take me to the hatch .
john_locke Hatch ?
john_locke -- I already showed you the ...
sayid_jarrah John , no more lies .

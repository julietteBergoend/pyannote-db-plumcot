marshal_edward_mars Don't trust her. She's dangerous.
dr_jack_shephard You should try not to move, man.
marshal_edward_mars Have to find her. Have to bring her back.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, you keep saying that. And every time I ask you who you have to bring back you pass out on me again. Since your fever's running pretty high, I'm guessing you have no idea who you're talking about.
marshal_edward_mars My cuffs, my handcuffs. Where are my cuffs?
dr_jack_shephard What?
marshal_edward_mars My jacket pocket.
dr_jack_shephard I don't...
marshal_edward_mars Jacket pocket.
dr_jack_shephard Okay.
marshal_edward_mars Dangerous. She's dangerous.
boone_carlyle It's getting dark.
james_ford Then pick up the pace.
boone_carlyle Hick.
james_ford Little louder?
sayid_jarrah We should make camp.
shannon_rutherford What, here?
sayid_jarrah Yes, here.
james_ford I'm not stopping. You all have a nice cookout.
sayid_jarrah Excellent, walk through the jungle in the dark.
james_ford Oooo, afraid the trees are going to get us?
sayid_jarrah No, what is knocking down the trees will get you.
james_ford Well, if you're so worried about me, how about you give me the clip back?
kate_austen Put the gun back in your pants, Sawyer. Sayid's right, if you keep walking you're not going to make it to the beach.
james_ford Yeah, why's that?
kate_austen Trust me.
sayid_jarrah This is Australia . This is us .
james_ford Nice stick.
sayid_jarrah Two days ago we take off from Sydney. We fly along the same north east route every commercial airliner bound for Los Angeles does. Now the pilot, he said he lost communication with the ground, correct?
kate_austen Yeah, 6 hours in. He turned around and headed for Fiji.
sayid_jarrah So, we changed course. Regrettably, no one knew we changed course. The turbulence hit. We know the rest.
kate_austen The pilot said we were over a thousand miles off course.
charlie_pace Yeah, but, they'll find us. They have satellites in space that can take pictures of your license plate.
sayid_jarrah If only we were all wearing license plates.
charlie_pace Well, aren't you the pessimist.
sayid_jarrah Basic photography - point and shoot. Satellites can shoot, but they must be told where to point.
charlie_pace Oh. Bollocks.
james_ford Okay, really enjoyed the puppet show. Fantastic. But we're stuck in the middle of damn nowhere. How about we talk about that other thing? You know that transmission Abdul picked up on his little radio? The French chick that said, "They're all dead." The transmission's been on a loop for â€¦ how long was it, Freckles?
kate_austen 16 years.
james_ford Right. Let's talk about that.
boone_carlyle Well, we have to tell the others when we get back.
shannon_rutherford Tell them what, exactly?
boone_carlyle What we heard.
shannon_rutherford You didn't hear anything. I'm not a stupid translator.
sayid_jarrah No one's going to tell them anything. To relay what we heard without fully understanding it will cause a panic. If we tell them what we know we take away their hope. And hope is a very dangerous thing to lose.
kate_austen So we lie.
hugo_reyes Was it a dinosaur?
dr_jack_shephard It wasn't a dinosaur.
hugo_reyes You say you didn't see it.
dr_jack_shephard I didn't.
hugo_reyes So how do you know it wasn't a dinosaur?
dr_jack_shephard Because dinosaurs are extinct.
hugo_reyes Oh. Yeah. So what's his story? He looks kind of... dying.
dr_jack_shephard He's not going to die.
hugo_reyes He's yellow, man.
dr_jack_shephard His wound is infected, but the antibiotics will fight it off.
hugo_reyes What if they don't?
dr_jack_shephard Then his body will shut down one piece at a time. His abdomen goes rigid, then...
hugo_reyes He looks like he's in pain.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah.
hugo_reyes What's this? Uh, dude? Uh... What do you think she did?
dr_jack_shephard It's none of my business.
hugo_reyes She looks pretty hard core.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley...
sayid_jarrah What are you doing?
boone_carlyle Standing guard. You heard what they said is out there.
james_ford You took my gun off me, boy?
shannon_rutherford Please, you've never even held a gun. He doesn't believe in guns. He's goes on marches.
boone_carlyle I don't go on marches.
sayid_jarrah Give it back to me.
james_ford Yeah, give it to Al Jazeera, he'll protect us.
charlie_pace Al Jazeera is a network.
boone_carlyle I'll keep the damn gun.
shannon_rutherford We should give it to her.
charlie_pace Yeah, Kate should hold the gun.
sayid_jarrah Fine with me. Well?
ray_mullen Good morning.
kate_austen Morning.
ray_mullen You were sleeping in my sheep pen.
kate_austen Sorry.
ray_mullen How'd you get here?
kate_austen I walked.
ray_mullen You walked?
kate_austen Yeah.
ray_mullen From where?
kate_austen Town.
ray_mullen Nearest town's 15 kilometers.
kate_austen Maybe that's why I was so exhausted.
ray_mullen What's your name?
kate_austen Annie.
ray_mullen You hungry, Annie?
ray_mullen So you want to tell me why you're trespassing on my property?
kate_austen I ran out of money.
ray_mullen You're an American.
kate_austen Canadian. I graduated from college and figured I'd see the world. Australia was top of my list so I hopped a flight to Melbourne but I don't know anybody here so I figured I'd walk for awhile, you know.
ray_mullen Melbourne's 100 kilometers from here.
kate_austen I like walking.
ray_mullen And you just happened to wonder onto my farm.
kate_austen I like farms, too.
ray_mullen Do you know how to work one?
kate_austen Yeah.
ray_mullen My wife died 8 months ago Wednesday. She left me with too many chores and a hell of a mortgage. If you help me with the first one, I'll give you a fair wage and a place to stay.
kate_austen Deal.
ray_mullen No. I'm a lefty.
hugo_reyes Dude, dude, they're back.
sayid_jarrah As you and the others know, we hiked up the mountain in an attempt to help the rescue team locate us. The transceiver failed to pick up a signal. We weren't able to send out a call for help. But we're not giving up. If we gather electronic equipment - your cell phones, laptops - I can boost the signal and we can try again, but that may take some time. So for now, we should begin rationing our remaining food. If it rains, we should set up tarps to collect water. I need to organize 3 separate groups. Each group should have a leader. One group for water - I'll organize that. Who's going to organize electronics? You? Rationing food? Okay. And I believe a third group should concern themselves with the construction of...
kate_austen Hi.
dr_jack_shephard Hey.
kate_austen I, um, I need to tell you something.
dr_jack_shephard Okay, sure.
kate_austen We couldn't send out a signal because there was another signal blocking it. The other signal - we heard it. It was a distress call from a French woman. She said that the others were dead - something had killed them all. She was alone on the Island. It's been playing for 16 years, Jack. I wanted to tell you.
dr_jack_shephard Anything else?
kate_austen How is he - the man with the shrapnel in his side?
dr_jack_shephard It's touch-and-go.
kate_austen He wake up?
dr_jack_shephard No, just for a few seconds during the surgery.
kate_austen He say anything?
dr_jack_shephard No.
hugo_reyes So what'd she say?
dr_jack_shephard She didn't say anything.
hugo_reyes But you told her you knew?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know anything.
hugo_reyes Well, you kind of know she's in that mug shot. And that we found those handcuffs. And that guy keeps mumbling "she's dangerous, she's dangerous" over and over.
dr_jack_shephard It's not my business. Not my problem.
hugo_reyes Yeah, you're right. We'll let Johnny Fever take care of her when he gets better.
dr_jack_shephard He's not getting better if we don't get some stronger antibiotics.
hugo_reyes That stuff I got from the luggage...
dr_jack_shephard It's for ear infections and foot fungus.
hugo_reyes We went through everything, man.
dr_jack_shephard What about that luggage in the overhead compartments?
hugo_reyes That's inside the plane.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah?
hugo_reyes But, the bodies are in there, and they're all... dead.
dr_jack_shephard Look, I'll handle it. Why don't you keep an eye on him...?
hugo_reyes Great. Yeah - love to - on it.
james_ford Boo.
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing in here?
james_ford Trick or treat, same as you.
dr_jack_shephard You're looting.
james_ford Aww, you say potato...
dr_jack_shephard What's in the bag?
james_ford Booze, smokes, couple of Playboys. What's in yours?
dr_jack_shephard Medicine.
james_ford Well, that about sums it up, don't it?
dr_jack_shephard Do you do this back home, too - steal from the dead?
james_ford Brother, you've to got wake up and smell the bull crap here, rescue ain't comin'. You're just wasting your time. You're trying to save a guy who last time I checked had a piece of metal the size of my head sticking out of his bread basket. Let me ask you something? How many of those pills are you going to use to fix him up?
dr_jack_shephard As many as it takes.
james_ford Yeah? How many you got? You're just not looking at the big picture, Doc. You're still back in civilization.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah? And where are you?
james_ford Me? I'm in the wild.
charlie_pace Whoa, hey, I got it. I got it.
claire_littleton Thanks.
charlie_pace Well, look on the bright side. Whoever's this was is probably better off than we are. I got it.
charlie_pace So, how's the baby?
claire_littleton It's okay, I think.
charlie_pace Good. So, your husband. Was he on the flight?
claire_littleton Oh, no. I'm not married.
charlie_pace Oh.
claire_littleton I know - how modern of me.
charlie_pace Well, who needs men, right? Bloody useless.
claire_littleton So, you guys hiked all the way up that mountain for nothing, huh?
kate_austen Hey, sorry.
hugo_reyes I was going to get some more water.
kate_austen We haven't met. I'm Kate.
hugo_reyes Hi, Kate.
kate_austen Hi.
hugo_reyes Hurley.
kate_austen I was just looking for Jack and I thought he might be in there.
hugo_reyes Yeah, no. Uh, he went to go get some medicine... over there.
kate_austen Where? In the fuselage?
hugo_reyes What? Yeah, in the uh, uh, you know? I've got to get that water.
ray_mullen The bank would have given you a heck of a toaster if you had kept that in a savings account.
kate_austen What do I need a toaster for?
ray_mullen You're hiding your wages in a tin can, Annie. I mean, I would have held on to it for you.
kate_austen I got trust issues.
ray_mullen Weren't you going to say goodbye?
kate_austen Wrote you a note.
ray_mullen You've been here almost 3 months, Annie. And every time I ask you about yourself, you get that look in your eye. Yeah, that one. So, I mind my own business. I figured maybe you got off on the wrong side of a bad relationship. Maybe you ran. I always knew you'd leave here someday. I guess I hoped it wouldn't be in the middle of the night.
kate_austen I'm sorry.
ray_mullen Yeah, so am I.
ray_mullen Hey, Annie, why don't you just stay one more night, eh? I'll drive you to the train station first thing in the morning. I promise.
kate_austen Okay.
ray_mullen I get it, you know. Everyone deserves a fresh start.
dr_jack_shephard Damn it. Damn it.
dr_jack_shephard Just breathe. Come on, come on, look, look at me, look. What did you do?
kate_austen I was just checking to if he was... he jumped on me. He grabbed me. Is he... okay?
dr_jack_shephard He's not responding to antibiotics, he's bleeding internally, his fever's pushing 104. And his abdomen's rigid. He needs water.
kate_austen So, what are you going to do about it?
dr_jack_shephard About what?
kate_austen About him.
dr_jack_shephard I told you, he needs water.
kate_austen Will he suffer?
dr_jack_shephard What?
kate_austen Will it be quick?
dr_jack_shephard No. It won't be quick. 2, 3, maybe 4 days.
kate_austen And he'll feel it?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, he'll feel it.
kate_austen Can't you put him out of his misery?
dr_jack_shephard I saw your mug shot, Kate. I am not a murderer.
ray_mullen Do they listen to Patsy Cline in Canada?
kate_austen They listen to Patsy Cline everywhere.
ray_mullen You hungry?
kate_austen I'll eat on the train.
ray_mullen You sure? There's a little place up here that makes a mean burger.
kate_austen What are you looking for, Ray?
ray_mullen What?
kate_austen How long have you known?
ray_mullen Couple of days. I saw your picture in the post office. I guess they knew you were Down Under.
kate_austen Why?
ray_mullen The reward's 23,000 dollars. I told you when I met you, I've got a hell of a mortgage. If it makes you feel any better, it was a hard decision, Annie.
kate_austen My name's not Annie.
michael_dawson Hey, who was that guy you were hanging out with?
walt_lloyd What guy?
michael_dawson The bald guy.
walt_lloyd Oh, Mr. Locke?
michael_dawson Mr. Locke got any kids?
walt_lloyd He didn't say.
michael_dawson Yeah, what did he say?
walt_lloyd I don't know.
michael_dawson What do you mean you don't know. What did he say?
walt_lloyd Some of it's secret.
michael_dawson Did he tell you not to tell me?
walt_lloyd No.
michael_dawson Then what's the secret?
walt_lloyd Mr. Locke said a miracle happened to him.
michael_dawson Yeah, well, a miracle happened to all of us, Walt. We survived a plane crash. Look, I don't want you hanging around with him anymore.
walt_lloyd Why not? He's my friend.
michael_dawson Hey, I'm your friend, too.
walt_lloyd If you were my friend, you'd find Vincent.
michael_dawson Walt, look, I haven't given up on your dog. I'm going to do everything I can to find him.
walt_lloyd No you won't.
michael_dawson Yeah, Walt, I will.
walt_lloyd You don't care about Vincent.
michael_dawson I'm going to get your dog back as soon as it stops raining. Hey listen to me, I'm going to get your dog back.
michael_dawson Yeah, soon as it stops raining - good, nice. I'm going to find your dog... yeah, I'm just going to go walking through the haunted damn jungle looking for your... Vincent?
michael_dawson Vincent? That you buddy?
michael_dawson Oh. Something was chasing me so, uh.. I don't hear it now. But you should probably head back. Uh, I didn't see anything, you know, if you're worried about it... I didn't see anything.
charlie_pace What are you making?
john_locke Whistle.
charlie_pace I used some tribal flutes once in a recording session. I'm in a band.
shannon_rutherford I wish he would just die already.
boone_carlyle Real humane, Shannon.
sayid_jarrah Anything I can do to help?
dr_jack_shephard No, I'm good, thanks.
sayid_jarrah The others are getting upset. They want to know what's going on inside the tent.
dr_jack_shephard Trying to save his life.
sayid_jarrah Rumor has it you can't.
james_ford Need a light?
james_ford Came by to thank you. You going to ask what for?
kate_austen What for?
james_ford For taking that gun away from me.
kate_austen I didn't take it away from you.
james_ford It's sticking out of your denims, ain't it? I sure wouldn't want to be the one with that gun right now. Because everyone sitting out there listening to that poor boy scream all night knows what's got to be done. Only one that can do it is the one with that gun. Don't act so surprised. I heard you tell the hero the same thing. Hell, there's only one bullet left - be damned near poetic.
marshal_edward_mars Listen to me.
dr_jack_shephard No, you need to keep quiet.
marshal_edward_mars Listen to me, no matter what she does - no matter how she makes you feel, don't you trust a word that she says. She will do anything to get away.
dr_jack_shephard What did she do?
marshal_edward_mars I want to talk to her.
dr_jack_shephard Tell me what she did.
marshal_edward_mars I want to talk to her, alone. She got to you, too, huh?
marshal_edward_mars Hey, Kate.
marshal_edward_mars What was it?
kate_austen What?
marshal_edward_mars The favor.
kate_austen I don't know what you're talking about.
marshal_edward_mars The last thing I heard before the crash - you wanted a favor.
kate_austen I have one favor to ask.
marshal_edward_mars Really? This ought to be good.
marshal_edward_mars Well?
kate_austen I wanted you to make sure that Ray Mullen got his 23 grand.
marshal_edward_mars Whatâ€”the guy who ratted you out?
kate_austen He had a hell of a mortgage.
marshal_edward_mars You really are one of a kind. You know, you would have got away if you hadn't saved him.
kate_austen In case you hadn't noticed, I did get away.
marshal_edward_mars You don't look free to me. Kate, I'm going to die, right?
kate_austen Yeah.
marshal_edward_mars So, are you going to do it, or what?
hugo_reyes Yo, so, where's the fugitive?
dr_jack_shephard In the tent.
hugo_reyes You let her in there alone?
dr_jack_shephard What's she going to do? She's 120 pounds soaking wet.
hugo_reyes Yeah, but she's got that gun.
dr_jack_shephard What?
hugo_reyes She's strapped, man. I saw it in her... in her... in her... in her...
dr_jack_shephard Kate?!
dr_jack_shephard What did you do?
james_ford What you couldn't. Look, I get where you're coming from being a doctor and all, but he wanted it. Hell, he asked me. So, I don't like it any more than you do, but something had to be done.
hugo_reyes Oh, no way. Guys?
dr_jack_shephard You shot him in the chest?
james_ford I was aiming for his heart.
dr_jack_shephard You missed.
hugo_reyes Man, is he still breathing?
dr_jack_shephard You perforated his lung. It'll take hours to bleed out.
james_ford So what isâ€”I only had one bullet.
dr_jack_shephard Get out. Get out!
hugo_reyes Oh boy.
james_ford Damn it!
john_locke I found your son's dog.
michael_dawson What?
john_locke Vincent-I tethered him to a tree just over there. I know that Walt lost his mom. I thought that you should be the one to bring his dog back to him.
michael_dawson Hey, thanks.
john_locke Welcome.
kate_austen I want to tell you what I did - why he was after me.
dr_jack_shephard I don't want to know. It doesn't matter, Kate, who we were - what we did before this, before the crash. It doesn't really... 3 days ago we all died. We should all be able to start over.
kate_austen Okay.
dr_jack_shephard Okay.

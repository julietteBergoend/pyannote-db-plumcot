dr_jack_shephard I was there , in the water .

kate_austen No .
kate_austen Sorry .
claire_littleton I must have looked through twenty suitcases .

hugo_reyes Hey Jack !
hugo_reyes Whoa .
hugo_reyes You look tired , brother .
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine .
dr_jack_shephard What's up ?
hugo_reyes We got a problem .
dr_jack_shephard That's it ?
charlie_pace That's it .
dr_jack_shephard How many ?
charlie_pace 18 .
hugo_reyes People just kind of took what they needed because we were supposed to be rescued , but we weren't .
charlie_pace Even if we divided it up , split the bottles in half it wouldn't be enough for 47 people .
dr_jack_shephard 46 .
dr_jack_shephard There is 46 of us now .
hugo_reyes People find out this is all we have left , they're going to freak out , man .
charlie_pace The boar's running low until we can catch another one .
charlie_pace What should we tell them ?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know .
hugo_reyes Maybe we can make one of those water finding sticks .
charlie_pace What should we do with the stuff we've got ?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know .
charlie_pace We should put it in the tent ,
charlie_pace yeah ?
hugo_reyes Maybe the dog can find water ?
charlie_pace Probably better if no one knows how little is left .
hugo_reyes I mean , dogs can find pot and bombs , so
hugo_reyes I'm sure they can find water .
charlie_pace Don't tell the others we're running low .
charlie_pace That way you can ration it .
charlie_pace Then you can decide what ...
dr_jack_shephard I'm not deciding anything !
hugo_reyes Why not ?
dr_christian_shephard You wanna come in ?
dr_christian_shephard So , you want to tell me what happened ?
young_jack JACK A couple guys jumped Marc Silverman .
dr_christian_shephard A couple guys jumped Marc Silverman .
dr_christian_shephard But they didn't jump you ?
young_jack No .
dr_christian_shephard I had a boy on my table today .
dr_christian_shephard I don't know , maybe a year younger than you .
dr_christian_shephard He had a bad heart .
dr_christian_shephard It got real hairy , real fast .
dr_christian_shephard And everybody's looking at your old man to make decisions .
dr_christian_shephard And I was able to make those decisions because at the end of the day , after the boy died , I was able to wash my hands and come home to dinner .
dr_christian_shephard You know , watch a little Carol Burnett , laugh till my sides hurt .
dr_christian_shephard And how can I do that , hmm ?
dr_christian_shephard And even when I fail , how do I do that , Jack ?
dr_christian_shephard Because I have what it takes .
dr_christian_shephard Don't choose , Jack , don't decide .
dr_christian_shephard You don't want to be a hero , you don't try and save everyone because when you fail ... you just don't have what it takes .
boone_carlyle Why didn't you leave me ?
boone_carlyle Hey , I'm talking to you .
dr_jack_shephard Not now , man .
boone_carlyle I could have made it back .
boone_carlyle What ?
boone_carlyle Not going to answer me ?
boone_carlyle I told you to leave me .
dr_jack_shephard You were drowning .
boone_carlyle You should've saved her .
dr_jack_shephard But I didn't save her .
dr_jack_shephard And neither did you .
boone_carlyle You think you're all noble and heroic for coming after me ?
boone_carlyle I was fine !
boone_carlyle You're not the only one who knows what to do around here , you know that ?
boone_carlyle I run a business !
boone_carlyle Who appointed you our savior , huh ?
boone_carlyle What gives you the right- .
boone_carlyle Look at me .
boone_carlyle Hey , I'm talking to you .

margo_shephard Why do you think that is ?

dr_jack_shephard I understand pressure .
margo_shephard Jack , please you know how he gets-he doesn't-he won't take care of himself .
margo_shephard You have to go after him .
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry .

kate_austen It's okay
kate_austen , it's okay .
charlie_pace What the ...
charlie_pace The water's gone .
charlie_pace Someone stole it .
john_locke Where is the doctor ?
kate_austen I don't know .
kate_austen No one can find him .
sayid_jarrah Is this the last of the camp's water supply ?
kate_austen Yeah .
sayid_jarrah Keeping it all in one place , foolish .
kate_austen I can go into the jungle , try to find some fresh water .
sayid_jarrah You're not going alone .
john_locke When the others find out the water's gone
john_locke it's going to get ugly .
john_locke And when they find out that someone pinched it , it's going to get uglier .
john_locke I'll go .
john_locke Camp needs you two here , especially with the doctor gone .
john_locke And besides , I know where to look .
dr_jack_shephard Where are you ?
dr_jack_shephard Where are you ?
dr_jack_shephard Where are you? !
hotel_manager The maid says he hasn't used the bed in the past three days .
dr_jack_shephard Did he rent a car from the concierge ?
hotel_manager No , sir .
hotel_manager Quite honestly , Mr . Shephard , I don't think your father rented a car at all .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , why's that ?
hotel_manager There was an incident a few nights ago , here at the hotel bar .
hotel_manager I had to get security to escort your father to his room .
dr_jack_shephard What's that have to do with renting a car ?
hotel_manager I'm sorry , sir , I shouldn't have said-
dr_jack_shephard Come on , what's that have to do with renting a car ?
hotel_manager Mr .
hotel_manager Shephard , I don't think any rental agent in Sydney would lease your father a car in his condition .
dr_jack_shephard My father is a Chief of Surgery .
hotel_manager Of course , sir .
hotel_manager I apologize .
dr_jack_shephard He left his wallet .
dr_jack_shephard Who leaves a wallet ?
hotel_manager Perhaps you should talk to the police , Mr . Shephard .
dr_jack_shephard Where are you ?

john_locke Come on .
john_locke You

charlie_pace Just relax , you have to think about the little one now , you .
claire_littleton Thanks for the water , Charlie .
charlie_pace There'd be more if some git hadn't nicked it .
claire_littleton Is Jack back yet ?
charlie_pace No .
charlie_pace No one's seen him .
charlie_pace But , I wouldn't worry .
charlie_pace Good old Mr .
charlie_pace Locke's gone into the jungle to get some water for you .
claire_littleton Great .
claire_littleton Our only hunter's going to get eaten just so he can get the pregnant girl some more water .
charlie_pace I wouldn't worry , luv .
charlie_pace I mean , you tell me , who would you rather meet in a dark alley , whatever's out there , or that geezer with his 400 knives ?
charlie_pace I mean , who packs 400 knives ?
charlie_pace Personally , I can only have space for 200 , 300 at most .
claire_littleton When are they going to rescue us ?
charlie_pace Soon .
claire_littleton Thanks , Charlie .
charlie_pace For what ?
claire_littleton People don't seem to look me in the eye here .
claire_littleton I think I scare them .
claire_littleton The baby ...
claire_littleton It's like I'm this time bomb of responsibility just waiting to go off .
charlie_pace You don't scare me .
hugo_reyes Uh , the Chinese people have water .
sayid_jarrah Where did you get this ?
sayid_jarrah Where did you get this ?
sayid_jarrah Where !
sayid_jarrah Did !
sayid_jarrah You!-
kate_austen She doesn't understand you .
sayid_jarrah She understands me .
sayid_jarrah Did you steal this water ?
kate_austen Just take it easy , alright .
kate_austen We just want to talk , alright ?
kate_austen This had water in it .
kate_austen Is it yours ?
kate_austen Who gave you this ?
sayid_jarrah I don't see the water .
kate_austen And ?
sayid_jarrah You go after him now , he'll give you nothing .
sayid_jarrah But if you wait , a rat will always lead you to it's hole .
james_ford Well , it's about time .
kate_austen For what ?
james_ford I made this birthday wish four years ago .
kate_austen Where's the water ?
james_ford That's better .
kate_austen Get off of me .
sayid_jarrah Give us the water now .
james_ford Touch me again , huh .
james_ford You really think I stole your damn water ?
sayid_jarrah We know you gave two bottles to the Koreans .
james_ford I don't give nothing to nobody .
kate_austen It's not here .
james_ford I traded Mr .
james_ford Miyagi the last of my water for a fish he caught .
james_ford We worked it out caveman style .
kate_austen You gave him your last two bottles ?
james_ford Water has no value , Freckles .
james_ford It's gonna rain sooner or later .
james_ford And hell , I'm an optimist .
james_ford Hey , you forgot something . .
james_ford Seeing as you're the new sheriff in town .
james_ford Might as well make it official .
dr_jack_shephard How are they , the others ?
john_locke Thirsty .
john_locke Hungry .
john_locke Waiting to be rescued .
john_locke And they need someone to tell them what to do .
dr_jack_shephard Me ?
dr_jack_shephard I can't .
john_locke Why can't you ?
dr_jack_shephard Because I'm not a leader .
john_locke And yet they all treat you like one .
dr_jack_shephard I don't know how to help them .
dr_jack_shephard I'll fail .
dr_jack_shephard I don't have what it takes .
john_locke Why are you out here , Jack ?
dr_jack_shephard I think I'm going crazy .
john_locke No .
john_locke You're not going crazy .
dr_jack_shephard No ?
john_locke No , crazy people don't know they're going crazy .
john_locke They think they're getting sane .
john_locke So , why are you out here ?
dr_jack_shephard I'm chasing something-someone .
john_locke Ah .
john_locke The white rabbit .
john_locke Alice in Wonderland .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , wonderland , because who I'm chasing-he's not there .
john_locke But you see him ?
dr_jack_shephard Yes .
dr_jack_shephard But he's not there .
john_locke And if I came to you and said the same thing , then what would your explanation be , as a doctor .
dr_jack_shephard I'd call it a hallucination .
dr_jack_shephard A result of dehydration , post traumatic stress , not getting more than two hours of sleep a night for the past week .
dr_jack_shephard All of the above .
john_locke All right , then .
john_locke You're hallucinating .
john_locke But what if you're not ?
dr_jack_shephard Then we're all in a lot of trouble .
john_locke I'm an ordinary man , Jack , meat and potatoes , I live in the real world .
john_locke I'm not a big believer in magic .
john_locke But this place is different .
john_locke It's special .
john_locke The others don't want to talk about it because it scares them .
john_locke But we all know it .
john_locke We all feel it .
john_locke Is your white rabbit a hallucination ?
john_locke Probably .
john_locke But what if everything that happened here , happened for a reason ?
john_locke What if this person that you're chasing is really here ?
dr_jack_shephard That's impossible .
john_locke Even if it is , let's say it's not .
dr_jack_shephard Then what happens when I catch him ?
john_locke I don't know .
john_locke But I've looked into the eye of this Island .
john_locke And what I saw was beautiful .
dr_jack_shephard Wait , wait , wait , where are you going ?
john_locke To find some more water .
dr_jack_shephard I'll come with you .
john_locke No .
john_locke You need to finish what you started .
dr_jack_shephard Why ?
john_locke Because a leader can't lead until he knows where he's going .
MEDICAL#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode05 The police found him in an alley in Queens Cross .
MEDICAL#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode05 Now , a tox screen showed a blood alcohol content , which for a man of his size , probably brought on myocardial infarction - a sizable , and fatal heart-attack .
dr_jack_shephard That's him .
dr_jack_shephard What do you mean you won't put it on the plane ?
ticket_agent I'm sorry
ticket_agent Mr . Shephard , but our policy is that the body must have the proper documentation .
ticket_agent There's just no latitude .
dr_jack_shephard No latitude ?
dr_jack_shephard No latitude ?
ticket_agent Without the proper documents-
dr_jack_shephard Look , you can't do this to me .
dr_jack_shephard I'm ready to go now .
ticket_agent Perhaps another carrier ?
dr_jack_shephard No !
dr_jack_shephard I want you to listen to me , okay .
dr_jack_shephard Because I'm asking you a favor , Chrissy .
dr_jack_shephard I'm standing in front of you in the same suit that I'm wearing to my father's funeral
dr_jack_shephard and I'm asking you a favor .
dr_jack_shephard In 16 hours I need to land at LAX , and I need that coffin to clear customs because there's going to be a hearse waiting there .
dr_jack_shephard And I need that hearse to take me and that coffin to a cemetery .
dr_jack_shephard Why ?
dr_jack_shephard Chrissy , why can't I just bring him to a funeral home and make all the arrangements ?
dr_jack_shephard Why can't I really take my time with it ?
dr_jack_shephard Because ...
dr_jack_shephard because I need it to be done .
dr_jack_shephard I need it to be over .
dr_jack_shephard I just-I need to bury my father .
boone_carlyle Hey , hey , Claire .
claire_littleton How did you get that ?
boone_carlyle Shhh .
charlie_pace Where'd you get that ?
charlie_pace Here's your thief .
michael_dawson Where'd he hide it ?
charlie_pace I don't know .
charlie_pace This wanker had three bottles on him .
charlie_pace Why'd you do it , pretty boy , eh ?
boone_carlyle It was just sitting in-it was just sitting in the tent , and Jack just took off .
charlie_pace Claire could've died !
boone_carlyle I tried to give her some sooner , but it just got out of hand .
boone_carlyle No one would have understood .
kate_austen What is going on ?
boone_carlyle Someone had to take responsibility for it .
boone_carlyle It would have never lasted !
charlie_pace Oh shut up !
dr_jack_shephard Leave him alone !
dr_jack_shephard It's been six days and we're all still waiting .
dr_jack_shephard Waiting for someone to come .
dr_jack_shephard But what if they don't ?
dr_jack_shephard We have to stop waiting .
dr_jack_shephard We need to start figuring things out .
dr_jack_shephard A woman died this morning just going for a swim and he tried to save her , and now you're about to crucify him ?
dr_jack_shephard We can't do this .
dr_jack_shephard Every man for himself is not going to work .
dr_jack_shephard It's time to start organizing .
dr_jack_shephard We need to figure out how we're going to survive here .
dr_jack_shephard Now , I found water .
dr_jack_shephard Fresh water , up in the valley .
dr_jack_shephard I'll take a group in at first light .
dr_jack_shephard If you don't wanna come then find another way to contribute .
dr_jack_shephard Last week most of us were strangers , but we're all here now .
dr_jack_shephard And god knows how long we're going to be here .
dr_jack_shephard But if we can't live together , we're going to die alone .
james_ford So , how does it feel ?
boone_carlyle How does what feel ?
james_ford Taking my place at the top of everyone's most hated list .
james_ford Sucks , don't it ?
dr_jack_shephard Thanks .
kate_austen So where were you today Jack ?
dr_jack_shephard Just had to take care of a few things .
kate_austen That's all I'm gonna get , huh ?
dr_jack_shephard My father died .
dr_jack_shephard In Sydney .
kate_austen I'm sorry .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry , too .

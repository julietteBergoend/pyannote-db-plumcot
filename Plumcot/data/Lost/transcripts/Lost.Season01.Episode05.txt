meathead Stay down! It's your choice man, walk away now and you won't get your ass kicked.
meathead You should've stayed down, Jack.
charlie_pace Jack, Jack!
charlie_pace Jack. Hey, Jack. There's someone out there. You gotta—the current's—there's someone out there, look.
charlie_pace I woke up and she's—I don't swim.
charlie_pace I don't swim.
dr_jack_shephard You okay, just take deep breaths now. Come on, just breathe, just breathe.
boone_carlyle Did you get her?
dr_jack_shephard What?
boone_carlyle There was a woman—I was trying to—did you get her?
boone_carlyle You gotta go back.
kate_austen Jack?
dr_jack_shephard There's someone else still out there.
kate_austen Hey.
dr_jack_shephard So, what'd they say?
kate_austen Jack, maybe you should...
dr_jack_shephard Who was she?
kate_austen Her name was Joanna, she wasn't supposed to be on the plane. She was scuba diving off the barrier reef and got an ear infection so the doctor grounded her for two days. She bumped her flight. That's how she ended up with us.
dr_jack_shephard She was just swimming this morning, got caught in a riptide. We've been here six days and I never talked to her. Never said a word to her.
kate_austen Jack, don't.
dr_jack_shephard There were 47 of us and I never said a single word to her.
kate_austen You tried.
dr_jack_shephard No I didn't. I thought maybe I'd—I thought maybe I could bring him back and still have the time. I was there, in the water. I didn't try. I decided not to go after her.
kate_austen Jack?
kate_austen Jack?
kate_austen Are you okay?
dr_jack_shephard Did you see that?
kate_austen What?
dr_jack_shephard Standing there, in the water, there was a man. You didn't see that?
kate_austen Jack, when was the last time you slept?
dr_jack_shephard I need to put this with the rest of the gear.
michael_dawson Who taught you that?
walt_lloyd Sun, the Korean lady.
michael_dawson Don't swallow it.
walt_lloyd Why not?
michael_dawson Ocean water'll make you thirsty.
walt_lloyd Why?
michael_dawson Just don't swallow it, man. Alright?
jinsoo_kwon 입술 좀 봐. 물을 꼭 마셔야 돼.
sunhwa_kwon 아니. 난 괜찮아요 고마워. 우리한테 언제 얘기해 줄까요? 뭘 어떻게 해야 할 지 모르겠네. 아무도 우릴 찾지 않을 것 같아요.
jinsoo_kwon 걱정하지 마. 사람이 올 거야.
sunhwa_kwon 모두 다 우릴 무시해요. 좀 더 적극적으로 얘기를 하려고 노력을 하면
jinsoo_kwon 우리는 괜찮을 거야. 다른 사람은 필요 없어. 그냥 내가 하라는 대로 하면 돼.
shannon_rutherford Have you got it or what?
james_ford You're in my light, sticks.
shannon_rutherford Lightsticks? What the hell is that supposed to...?
james_ford Light, comma, sticks. As in those legs of yours.
shannon_rutherford Look, while I really love my new nickname, and I think it's really sweet...
james_ford Calm down. I got your damn stuff.
shannon_rutherford It'll keep off sand fleas?
james_ford You bet. Even has aloe.
shannon_rutherford How much?
james_ford Your money's no good here.
shannon_rutherford Then what the hell do you want?
shannon_rutherford If you really think I'm going to...
james_ford Five grand.
shannon_rutherford I thought you said my money was no good here.
james_ford I was negotiating. I can take an IOU. Something tells me you're good... for it.
claire_littleton You haven't found a hairbrush in there, have you?
kate_austen No. Sorry.
claire_littleton I must have looked through twenty suitcases. I can't find one. It's weird, right? When you think that everyone packs a hairbrush.
kate_austen You alright?
claire_littleton Yeah, it's just the heat. Oh, and, and I'm pregnant.
kate_austen Really?
claire_littleton Thanks. What are you doing?
kate_austen I'm sorting the practical clothes from the impractical. Wanna help?
claire_littleton Sure. Can I—can I ask you something?
kate_austen Sure, shoot.
claire_littleton Are you a Gemini?
kate_austen Yeah, I am.
claire_littleton I thought so, restless, passionate. You know, everyone thinks astrology's just a load of crap but that's just because they don't get it. I can do your chart if you want to? Or not... Geminis...
hugo_reyes Hey Jack!
hugo_reyes Whoa. You look tired, brother.
dr_jack_shephard I'm fine. What's up?
hugo_reyes We got a problem.
dr_jack_shephard That's it?
charlie_pace That's it.
dr_jack_shephard How many?
charlie_pace 18.
hugo_reyes People just kind of took what they needed because we were supposed to be rescued, but we weren't.
charlie_pace Even if we divided it up, split the bottles in half it wouldn't be enough for 47 people.
dr_jack_shephard 46. There is 46 of us now.
hugo_reyes People find out this is all we have left, they're going to freak out, man.
charlie_pace The boar's running low until we can catch another one. What should we tell them?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know.
hugo_reyes Maybe we can make one of those water finding sticks.
charlie_pace What should we do with the stuff we've got?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know.
charlie_pace We should put it in the tent, yeah?
hugo_reyes Maybe the dog can find water?
charlie_pace Probably better if no one knows how little is left.
hugo_reyes I mean, dogs can find pot and bombs, so I'm sure they can find water.
charlie_pace Don't tell the others we're running low. That way you can ration it. Then you can decide what...
dr_jack_shephard I'm not deciding anything!
hugo_reyes Why not?
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD You wanna come in?
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD So, you want to tell me what happened?
young_jack JACK A couple guys jumped Marc Silverman.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD A couple guys jumped Marc Silverman. But they didn't jump you?
young_jack JACK No.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD I had a boy on my table today. I don't know, maybe a year younger than you. He had a bad heart. It got real hairy, real fast. And everybody's looking at your old man to make decisions. And I was able to make those decisions because at the end of the day, after the boy died, I was able to wash my hands and come home to dinner. You know, watch a little Carol Burnett, laugh till my sides hurt. And how can I do that, hmm? And even when I fail, how do I do that, Jack? Because I have what it takes. Don't choose, Jack, don't decide. You don't want to be a hero, you don't try and save everyone because when you fail... you just don't have what it takes.
boone_carlyle Why didn't you leave me? Hey, I'm talking to you.
dr_jack_shephard Not now, man.
boone_carlyle I could have made it back. What? Not going to answer me? I told you to leave me.
dr_jack_shephard You were drowning.
boone_carlyle You should've saved her.
dr_jack_shephard But I didn't save her. And neither did you.
boone_carlyle You think you're all noble and heroic for coming after me? I was fine! You're not the only one who knows what to do around here, you know that? I run a business! Who appointed you our savior, huh? What gives you the right—. Look at me. Hey, I'm talking to you.
boone_carlyle Look at me, Jack. Where are you going? Hey, where are going? Hey!
dr_jack_shephard Dad?
margo_shephard Your father's gone, Jack. Did you hear what I said? He's gone, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard He'll be back.
margo_shephard This time it's different. I want you to bring him back.
margo_shephard What?
dr_jack_shephard He hasn't talked to me in two months, Mom.
margo_shephard You haven't talked to him in two months.
dr_jack_shephard He doesn't want me to bring him back, trust me. Let one of his friends.
margo_shephard He doesn't have friends anymore. Why do you think that is? He was right about you.
dr_jack_shephard Right about what?
margo_shephard You don't understand the pressure that he's under.
dr_jack_shephard I understand pressure.
margo_shephard Jack, please you know how he gets—he doesn't—he won't take care of himself. You have to go after him.
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry. I can't.
margo_shephard "I can't?" You don't get to say "I can't." Not after what you did. Bring your father home, Jack.
dr_jack_shephard Where is he?
margo_shephard Australia.
walt_lloyd Hey, hey!
kate_austen What's the matter?
walt_lloyd That pregnant lady fell down.
kate_austen What happened?
charlie_pace She just dropped.
kate_austen It must be the heat. Is she breathing?
michael_dawson Yeah, I think.
kate_austen Come on. Let's get her inside.
charlie_pace Wake up.
kate_austen Claire? Claire, honey, wake up. Claire? Can you hear me, Claire. Come on. Wake up. Come on. Come on, please wake up. Come on. Claire, can you hear me? Alright.
claire_littleton Hmm?
kate_austen Hi. It's me. It's Kate.
claire_littleton What?
kate_austen You passed out. Just take it easy, okay? She needs water.
kate_austen Don't move, okay? Honey, I think you have a fever, but if you keep really still that's okay. It's okay, it's okay.
charlie_pace What the... The water's gone. Someone stole it.
john_locke Where is the doctor?
kate_austen I don't know. No one can find him.
sayid_jarrah Is this the last of the camp's water supply?
kate_austen Yeah.
sayid_jarrah Keeping it all in one place, foolish.
kate_austen I can go into the jungle, try to find some fresh water.
sayid_jarrah You're not going alone.
john_locke When the others find out the water's gone it's going to get ugly. And when they find out that someone pinched it, it's going to get uglier. I'll go. Camp needs you two here, especially with the doctor gone. And besides, I know where to look.
dr_jack_shephard Where are you? Where are you? Where are you?!
hotel_manager MANAGER The maid says he hasn't used the bed in the past three days.
dr_jack_shephard Did he rent a car from the concierge?
hotel_manager MANAGER No, sir. Quite honestly, Mr. Shephard, I don't think your father rented a car at all.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, why's that?
hotel_manager MANAGER There was an incident a few nights ago, here at the hotel bar. I had to get security to escort your father to his room.
dr_jack_shephard What's that have to do with renting a car?
hotel_manager MANAGER I'm sorry, sir, I shouldn't have said-
dr_jack_shephard Come on, what's that have to do with renting a car?
hotel_manager MANAGER Mr. Shephard, I don't think any rental agent in Sydney would lease your father a car in his condition.
dr_jack_shephard My father is a Chief of Surgery.
hotel_manager MANAGER Of course, sir. I apologize.
dr_jack_shephard He left his wallet. Who leaves a wallet?
hotel_manager MANAGER Perhaps you should talk to the police, Mr. Shephard.
dr_jack_shephard Where are you?
john_locke Take my hand. Come on.
john_locke You okay?
charlie_pace Hey.
claire_littleton Hey. How long have I...
charlie_pace A couple of hours. Here. It's not much but it's what we have. Just relax, you have to think about the little one now, you.
claire_littleton Thanks for the water, Charlie.
charlie_pace There'd be more if some git hadn't nicked it.
claire_littleton Is Jack back yet?
charlie_pace No. No one's seen him. But, I wouldn't worry. Good old Mr. Locke's gone into the jungle to get some water for you.
claire_littleton Great. Our only hunter's going to get eaten just so he can get the pregnant girl some more water.
charlie_pace I wouldn't worry, luv. I mean, you tell me, who would you rather meet in a dark alley, whatever's out there, or that geezer with his 400 knives? I mean, who packs 400 knives? Personally, I can only have space for 200, 300 at most.
claire_littleton When are they going to rescue us?
charlie_pace Soon.
claire_littleton Thanks, Charlie.
charlie_pace For what?
claire_littleton People don't seem to look me in the eye here. I think I scare them. The baby... It's like I'm this time bomb of responsibility just waiting to go off.
charlie_pace You don't scare me.
hugo_reyes Uh, the Chinese people have water.
sayid_jarrah Where did you get this? Where did you get this? Where! Did! You!-
kate_austen She doesn't understand you.
sayid_jarrah She understands me. Did you steal this water?
sunhwa_kwon 죄송하지만 무슨 오해가 있는 것 같은데요. 그런 게 아니라
jinsoo_kwon 떨어져, 이 새끼야. 내 와이프 한 번만 더 만지면 넌 죽어.
kate_austen Just take it easy, alright. We just want to talk, alright? This had water in it. Is it yours? Who gave you this?
sayid_jarrah I don't see the water.
kate_austen And?
sayid_jarrah You go after him now, he'll give you nothing. But if you wait, a rat will always lead you to it's hole.
james_ford Well, it's about time.
kate_austen For what?
james_ford I made this birthday wish four years ago.
kate_austen Where's the water?
james_ford That's better.
kate_austen Get off of me.
sayid_jarrah Give us the water now.
james_ford Touch me again, huh.
james_ford You really think I stole your damn water?
sayid_jarrah We know you gave two bottles to the Koreans.
james_ford I don't give nothing to nobody.
kate_austen It's not here.
james_ford I traded Mr. Miyagi the last of my water for a fish he caught. We worked it out caveman style.
kate_austen You gave him your last two bottles?
james_ford Water has no value, Freckles. It's gonna rain sooner or later. And hell, I'm an optimist.
james_ford Hey, you forgot something. . Seeing as you're the new sheriff in town. Might as well make it official.
dr_jack_shephard How are they, the others?
john_locke Thirsty. Hungry. Waiting to be rescued. And they need someone to tell them what to do.
dr_jack_shephard Me? I can't.
john_locke Why can't you?
dr_jack_shephard Because I'm not a leader.
john_locke And yet they all treat you like one.
dr_jack_shephard I don't know how to help them. I'll fail. I don't have what it takes.
john_locke Why are you out here, Jack?
dr_jack_shephard I think I'm going crazy.
john_locke No. You're not going crazy.
dr_jack_shephard No?
john_locke No, crazy people don't know they're going crazy. They think they're getting sane. So, why are you out here?
dr_jack_shephard I'm chasing something—someone.
john_locke Ah. The white rabbit. Alice in Wonderland.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, wonderland, because who I'm chasing—he's not there.
john_locke But you see him?
dr_jack_shephard Yes. But he's not there.
john_locke And if I came to you and said the same thing, then what would your explanation be, as a doctor.
dr_jack_shephard I'd call it a hallucination. A result of dehydration, post traumatic stress, not getting more than two hours of sleep a night for the past week. All of the above.
john_locke All right, then. You're hallucinating. But what if you're not?
dr_jack_shephard Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
john_locke I'm an ordinary man, Jack, meat and potatoes, I live in the real world. I'm not a big believer in magic. But this place is different. It's special. The others don't want to talk about it because it scares them. But we all know it. We all feel it. Is your white rabbit a hallucination? Probably. But what if everything that happened here, happened for a reason? What if this person that you're chasing is really here?
dr_jack_shephard That's impossible.
john_locke Even if it is, let's say it's not.
dr_jack_shephard Then what happens when I catch him?
john_locke I don't know. But I've looked into the eye of this Island. And what I saw was beautiful.
dr_jack_shephard Wait, wait, wait, where are you going?
john_locke To find some more water.
dr_jack_shephard I'll come with you.
john_locke No. You need to finish what you started.
dr_jack_shephard Why?
john_locke Because a leader can't lead until he knows where he's going.
MEDICAL#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode05 EXAMINER The police found him in an alley in Queens Cross. Now, a tox screen showed a blood alcohol content, which for a man of his size, probably brought on myocardial infarction - a sizable, and fatal heart-attack.
dr_jack_shephard That's him.
dr_jack_shephard What do you mean you won't put it on the plane?
ticket_agent I'm sorry Mr. Shephard, but our policy is that the body must have the proper documentation. There's just no latitude.
dr_jack_shephard No latitude? No latitude?
ticket_agent Without the proper documents-
dr_jack_shephard Look, you can't do this to me. I'm ready to go now.
ticket_agent Perhaps another carrier?
dr_jack_shephard No!
dr_jack_shephard I want you to listen to me, okay. Because I'm asking you a favor, Chrissy. I'm standing in front of you in the same suit that I'm wearing to my father's funeral and I'm asking you a favor. In 16 hours I need to land at LAX, and I need that coffin to clear customs because there's going to be a hearse waiting there. And I need that hearse to take me and that coffin to a cemetery. Why? Chrissy, why can't I just bring him to a funeral home and make all the arrangements? Why can't I really take my time with it? Because... because I need it to be done. I need it to be over. I just—I need to bury my father.
boone_carlyle Hey, hey, Claire .
claire_littleton How did you get that?
boone_carlyle Shhh.
charlie_pace Where'd you get that?
charlie_pace Here's your thief.
michael_dawson Where'd he hide it?
charlie_pace I don't know. This wanker had three bottles on him. Why'd you do it, pretty boy, eh?
boone_carlyle It was just sitting in—it was just sitting in the tent, and Jack just took off.
charlie_pace Claire could've died!
boone_carlyle I tried to give her some sooner, but it just got out of hand. No one would have understood.
kate_austen What is going on?
boone_carlyle Someone had to take responsibility for it. It would have never lasted!
charlie_pace Oh shut up!
dr_jack_shephard Leave him alone! It's been six days and we're all still waiting. Waiting for someone to come. But what if they don't? We have to stop waiting. We need to start figuring things out. A woman died this morning just going for a swim and he tried to save her, and now you're about to crucify him? We can't do this. Every man for himself is not going to work. It's time to start organizing. We need to figure out how we're going to survive here. Now, I found water. Fresh water, up in the valley. I'll take a group in at first light. If you don't wanna come then find another way to contribute. Last week most of us were strangers, but we're all here now. And god knows how long we're going to be here. But if we can't live together, we're going to die alone.
sunhwa_kwon 고마워요-- 아까 물 갖다 줘서.
jinsoo_kwon 남편이니까 그렇게 해야지.
james_ford So, how does it feel?
boone_carlyle How does what feel?
james_ford Taking my place at the top of everyone's most hated list. Sucks, don't it?
dr_jack_shephard Thanks.
kate_austen So where were you today Jack?
dr_jack_shephard Just had to take care of a few things.
kate_austen That's all I'm gonna get, huh?
dr_jack_shephard My father died. In Sydney.
kate_austen I'm sorry.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah. I'm sorry, too.

charlie_pace Sayid .
charlie_pace I'm on it , Sayid .
kate_austen I might throw up on you .
dr_jack_shephard You're doing fine .
kate_austen You don't seem afraid at all .
kate_austen I don't understand that .
dr_jack_shephard Well , fear's sort of an odd thing .
dr_jack_shephard When I was in residency , my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16 year old kid , a girl .
dr_jack_shephard And at the end , after 13 hours , I was closing her up and
dr_jack_shephard I , I accidentally ripped her dural sac .
dr_jack_shephard Shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together , membrane as thin as tissue .
dr_jack_shephard And so it ripped open .
dr_jack_shephard And the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta , spinal fluid flowing out of her
dr_jack_shephard and I ...
dr_jack_shephard And the terror was just so ... crazy .
dr_jack_shephard So real .
dr_jack_shephard And I knew I had to deal with it .
dr_jack_shephard So I just made a choice .
dr_jack_shephard I'd let the fear in , let it take over ,
dr_jack_shephard let it do its thing , but only for five seconds , that's all I was going to give it .
dr_jack_shephard So I started to count One , two , three , four , five .
dr_jack_shephard Then it was gone .
dr_jack_shephard I went back to work , sewed her up
dr_jack_shephard and she was fine .
kate_austen If that had been me , I think I would have run for the door .
dr_jack_shephard No , I don't think that's true .
dr_jack_shephard You're not running now .
sayid_jarrah You think they would have come by now .
charlie_pace Huh ?
charlie_pace Who ?
sayid_jarrah Anyone .
shannon_rutherford As if I'm going to start eating chocolate .
boone_carlyle Shannon , we may be here for a while .

hugo_reyes Well , hang in there .
claire_littleton Yeah , you too .
michael_dawson You sure you're warm enough ?
kate_austen Do you think he's going to live ?
dr_jack_shephard Do you know him ?
kate_austen He was sitting next to me .
dr_jack_shephard We must have been at about 40,000 feet when it happened .
dr_jack_shephard Hit an air pocket .
dr_jack_shephard Dropped , maybe , 200 feet .
dr_jack_shephard The turbulence was ...
dr_jack_shephard I blacked out .
kate_austen I didn't .
kate_austen I saw the whole thing .
kate_austen I knew that the tail was gone , but I couldn't bring myself to look back .
kate_austen And then the , the front of the plane broke off .
dr_jack_shephard Well , it's not here on the beach .
dr_jack_shephard Neither is the tail .
dr_jack_shephard We need to figure out which way we came in .
kate_austen Why ?
dr_jack_shephard Because there's a chance we could find the cockpit .
dr_jack_shephard If it's intact , we might be able to find a transceiver .
dr_jack_shephard Send out a signal , help the rescue party find us .
kate_austen How do you know all that ?
dr_jack_shephard Took a couple flying lessons .
dr_jack_shephard Wasn't for me .
kate_austen I saw some smoke .
kate_austen Just through the valley .
kate_austen If you're thinking about going for the cockpit , I'm going with you .
dr_jack_shephard I don't know your name .
kate_austen I'm Kate .
dr_jack_shephard Jack .
shannon_rutherford What was that ?
charlie_pace That was weird , right ?
walt_lloyd Is that Vincent ?
michael_dawson It's not Vincent .
claire_littleton Did anybody see that ?
hugo_reyes Yeah .
shannon_rutherford Boone !
charlie_pace Terrific .
cindy_chandler So , how's the drink ?
dr_jack_shephard It's good .
cindy_chandler That wasn't a very strong reaction .
dr_jack_shephard Well , it's not a very strong drink .
cindy_chandler Shhh .
cindy_chandler Just don't tell anyone .
dr_jack_shephard This of course breaks some critical FAA regulations .
charlie_pace Excuse me .
cindy_chandler Sir , excuse me !
rose_nadler Guess he really had to go .
cindy_chandler Sir , excuse me !
cindy_chandler Ladies and gentleman , the pilot has switched on the " fasten seatbelt " sign .
cindy_chandler Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts .
dr_jack_shephard It's normal .
rose_nadler Oh , I know .
rose_nadler I've just never been a very good flier .
rose_nadler My husband keeps reminding me that planes want to be in the air .
dr_jack_shephard Well , he sounds like a very smart man .
rose_nadler Be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom .
dr_jack_shephard Well , I'll keep you company until he does .
dr_jack_shephard Don't worry it's going to be over ...
michael_dawson It didn't sound like an animal .
michael_dawson Not exactly , I mean .
rose_nadler That sound that it made , I keep thinking that there was something really familiar about it .
shannon_rutherford Really ?
shannon_rutherford Where are you from ?
rose_nadler The Bronx .
charlie_pace Might be monkeys .
charlie_pace It's monkeys , right ?
james_ford Sure it's monkeys .
james_ford It's Monkey Island .
hugo_reyes Technically , you know , we don't even know if we're on an island .
sayid_jarrah We're on an Island .
kate_austen You ready ?
dr_jack_shephard Kate , you showed me where the smoke was .
dr_jack_shephard I can get there myself .
kate_austen I'm coming .
dr_jack_shephard Well , you're going to need better shoes .
michael_dawson Whatever it was ...
michael_dawson it wasn't natural .
charlie_pace Does anyone have any sun block ?
shannon_rutherford Yeah , I do .
charlie_pace Ah .
charlie_pace Cool .
hugo_reyes So , I was just looking inside the fuselage ...
hugo_reyes It's pretty grim in there .
hugo_reyes You think we should do something about the , uh ... b-o-d-y-s ?
michael_dawson What are you spelling , man ?
michael_dawson " Bodies " ?
walt_lloyd B-o-d-i-e-s .
sayid_jarrah That sounds like a good idea .
shannon_rutherford No !
shannon_rutherford They'll deal with it when they get here .
dr_jack_shephard We go out and look for the cockpit .
dr_jack_shephard See if we can find a transceiver , to send a distress signal , help the rescue team .
dr_jack_shephard You're going to need to keep an eye on the wounded .
dr_jack_shephard If the guy in the suit wakes up , try to keep him calm , but don't let him remove that piece of shrapnel .
dr_jack_shephard You understand ?
boone_carlyle Yeah , got it .
boone_carlyle What about the guy with the leg ?
boone_carlyle The , the tourniquet .
dr_jack_shephard I stopped the bleeding .
dr_jack_shephard I took it off last night .
dr_jack_shephard He ... he should be all right .
boone_carlyle Yeah .
boone_carlyle Cool .
boone_carlyle Good job .

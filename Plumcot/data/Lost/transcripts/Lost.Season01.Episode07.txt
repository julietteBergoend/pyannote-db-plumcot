john_locke Charlie .
john_locke Charlie .
john_locke How about you and I go for a walk ?
charlie_pace No .
charlie_pace No thanks , Locke .
charlie_pace I think I'm going to stay in today .
john_locke Come on .
john_locke Fresh air will do you good .
kate_austen I take better pictures than that .
kate_austen Smaller , too , if you want something for your wallet .
dr_jack_shephard I just came by for a few things and this was . . .
dr_jack_shephard this was with my stuff . .
kate_austen So you're not staying ?
dr_jack_shephard Call me a broken record , but caves are a natural shelter .
dr_jack_shephard And a hell of a safer than living here on the beach .
kate_austen You're mad at me .
dr_jack_shephard No .
dr_jack_shephard Kate , I'm --
dr_jack_shephard I just don't understand why you won't come with me .
dr_jack_shephard Us .
dr_jack_shephard It's maybe a mile up there , if that .
kate_austen We crashed 8 days ago , Jack .
kate_austen I'm not setting up a house here .
dr_jack_shephard I want off this Island too , but we both know that's not gonna happen any time soon .
kate_austen Sayid has a plan .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , to find the source of the distress code , I know .
kate_austen The signal's coming from somewhere on the Island .
kate_austen If we can find it . . .
dr_jack_shephard The signal has been running on a loop for 16 years , Kate .
dr_jack_shephard And the woman that left it , she wasn't rescued .
dr_jack_shephard What makes you think it's gonna be any different for us ?
kate_austen I believe it .
dr_jack_shephard Well , I wish I shared your faith .
james_ford Wouldn't mind sharing a few things with her myself .
kate_austen What do you want , Sawyer ?
james_ford Heard the doctor was vacating the premises .
james_ford Thought I'd best lay claims to my new digs before somebody else did .
james_ford I could fix this place up real good .
james_ford Might even find somebody to share it with me .
dr_jack_shephard I'll talk to you later .
charlie_pace Locke , is that you ?
charlie_pace Bless me father , for I have sinned .
charlie_pace It's been a week since my last confession .
PRIEST#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode07 Go ahead my son .
charlie_pace Last night I had physical relations with a girl I didn't even know .
PRIEST#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode07 I see .
PRIEST#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode07 Anything else ?
charlie_pace Yeah .
charlie_pace Uh , right after that I had relations with another girl .
charlie_pace Then straight after that I watched while they had relations with each other .
charlie_pace You see , it's ,
charlie_pace it's my band , father , Drive Shaft .
charlie_pace We've been playing the clubs in Manchester .
charlie_pace And , uh , we've been getting some heat , a following , you know , and , uh , the girls .
charlie_pace There's some real temptations that come with the territory , if you know what I mean .
PRIEST#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode07 Well , we all have our temptations , but giving in to them , that's your choice .
PRIEST#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode07 As we live our lives it's really nothing but a series of choices , isn't it ?
charlie_pace Well , then , I've made my choice .
charlie_pace I have to quit the band .
liam_pace And the meek shall inherit the earth .
charlie_pace Liam , what are doing ?
charlie_pace This is a church .
liam_pace Relax , choir boy .
liam_pace I bring good tidings of great joy .
liam_pace We've just been signed .
liam_pace A recording contract .
liam_pace You're gonna be a rock god .
john_locke Nice work , Charlie .
john_locke You make excellent bait .
charlie_pace I'm glad I could oblige .
charlie_pace Now give me my bloody drugs .
charlie_pace Did you hear what I said ?
charlie_pace I want my drugs back .
charlie_pace I need 'em .
john_locke Yet you gave them to me .
john_locke Hmm .
charlie_pace And I bloody
charlie_pace well regret it .
charlie_pace I'm sick , man .
charlie_pace Can't you see that ?
john_locke I think you're a lot stronger than you know , Charlie .
john_locke And I'm going to prove it to you .
john_locke I'll let you ask me for your drugs three times .
john_locke The third time , I'm going to give them to you .
john_locke Now , just so we're clear , this is one .
charlie_pace Why ?
charlie_pace Why ?
charlie_pace Why are you doing this ?
charlie_pace To torture me ?
charlie_pace Just get rid of them and have done with it ?
john_locke If I did that you wouldn't have a choice , Charlie .
john_locke And having choices , making decisions based on more than instinct , is the only thing that separates you from him .
sayid_jarrah Three antenna .
sayid_jarrah Three points of a triangle .
sayid_jarrah One here on the beach .
sayid_jarrah Another , Kate will position in the jungle , roughly two kilometers in , and the third I'll take to high ground , up there .
sayid_jarrah If the French transmission is coming from somewhere within our triangulation , I'll be able to locate the source .
sayid_jarrah But there are two complications .
boone_carlyle Of course there are .
sayid_jarrah The power cells I grafted onto the antennas are dry .
sayid_jarrah There's no telling how long they'll last .
sayid_jarrah A minute -- maybe more , maybe less .
kate_austen So we have to wait until we're in position before we switch them on .
boone_carlyle Wait .
boone_carlyle Wait a second .
boone_carlyle How are we going to be able to tell that we're actually in the right position ?
boone_carlyle We have no way to communicate with each other .
kate_austen Bottle rockets ?
sayid_jarrah Thank God for fireworks smugglers .
sayid_jarrah Now , when I'm in position I'll fire off my rocket .
sayid_jarrah When you two see it , you fire yours .
sayid_jarrah As soon as the last one has gone up we all switch on our antennas .
kate_austen Okay , but you said there are two complications .
sayid_jarrah The battery in the transceiver is dead .
sayid_jarrah Without the transceiver all of this is for nothing .
sayid_jarrah Something from a laptop computer would probably work , but I've not been able to find anything .
kate_austen I think I might know where to look .
kate_austen You're hoarding like a pack rat since the crash
kate_austen and you don't have a single laptop ?
james_ford We are testy .
james_ford Still upset about your little break up ?
james_ford You and Jacko ?
kate_austen It must be exhausting .
james_ford What's that ?
kate_austen Living like a parasite -- always taking , never giving .
james_ford Well , you got me pegged , don't you ?
kate_austen I get it now .
kate_austen You don't want off this Island because there's nothing for you to go back for .
kate_austen Nobody you miss .
kate_austen And no one misses you .
james_ford Oh , you're feeling sorry for me .
kate_austen I don't feel sorry for you .
kate_austen I pity you .
james_ford All you had to do was say please .
hugo_reyes Dude , what's in these things , cinderblocks ?
dr_jack_shephard I packed everything I thought might be useful here without leaving the others shorthanded .
charlie_pace Hey , you guys need a hand ? .
charlie_pace I used to load the band's equipment , before we had roadies , way back in the day .
charlie_pace Here let me .
dr_jack_shephard Charlie , the zipper's ... ...broken .
charlie_pace Sorry , just trying to help .
dr_jack_shephard I know , I know , it's okay .
dr_jack_shephard Hey , want to help me grab the rest of those bags ?
hugo_reyes Oh , could I ?
dr_jack_shephard What are you doing ?
charlie_pace Oh , uh , I have a headache .
dr_jack_shephard Diazepam .
dr_jack_shephard That's for anxiety .
charlie_pace I was looking for aspirin .
dr_jack_shephard Pretty strong stuff for a headache .
charlie_pace Yeah , right .
dr_jack_shephard Hey , you okay ?
dr_jack_shephard You're looking a little ...
charlie_pace No , it's nothing , it's just a headache .
dr_jack_shephard Charlie , leave it .
dr_jack_shephard Go get some water .
dr_jack_shephard Maybe you're dehydrated .
dr_jack_shephard Charlie , I got it .
dr_jack_shephard Go take care of yourself , man .
dr_jack_shephard We don't need you right now .
liam_pace Come on , Charlie boy .
liam_pace We can't do this without you .
liam_pace You are bloody Drive Shaft .
charlie_pace Watch the language .
liam_pace This is our shot at the big time .
liam_pace What ?
liam_pace You don't want to be famous ?
charlie_pace It's not about all that .
charlie_pace I only care about the music .
liam_pace Yeah , your music .
liam_pace Your songs that got us signed .
liam_pace I'm just a clown with a pretty face that sings them .
liam_pace And you want to take away my chance to be somebody ?
charlie_pace Liam , it's not about you .
charlie_pace It's -- I love the band .
charlie_pace It's not who I am .
charlie_pace Sometimes I just get lost in it .
liam_pace Won't happen -- because I'll be there looking out for you .
liam_pace We'll look out for each other .
liam_pace That's what brothers do , right ?
liam_pace Right ?
charlie_pace Wait , wait , wait
charlie_pace wait wait .
charlie_pace Just promise me one thing .
charlie_pace If things get too crazy no matter what , if I say we're done , we walk away .
liam_pace We walk away .
charlie_pace Liam , promise .
liam_pace We walk away .
liam_pace You're the rock god baby brother .
hugo_reyes Hey , dude .
hugo_reyes This yours ?
charlie_pace Oh yeah .
charlie_pace You're probably wondering because I play bass in Drive Shaft .
charlie_pace I wrote a bunch of tunes on that -- You , All , Everybody .
hugo_reyes Listen , uh , man .
hugo_reyes Jack just wants you to find another place for it .
hugo_reyes He's moving supplies and says it's in the way .
charlie_pace You know ?
charlie_pace A lot of people look up to me .
charlie_pace They respect me .
charlie_pace And you , you just treat me like I'm some bloody child !
charlie_pace Like I'm some useless joke !
dr_jack_shephard What are you talking about ?
charlie_pace Charlie's not good enough to do this , Charlie's just in the way .
charlie_pace Put Charlie onto that .
dr_jack_shephard Sit down .
dr_jack_shephard Let me take a look at you man .
charlie_pace Oh , you're going to look out for me ,
charlie_pace yeah? !
charlie_pace We'll look out for each other , that's how it is? !
charlie_pace I'm not interested !
dr_jack_shephard Charlie , just calm down , alright .
dr_jack_shephard You're not yourself .
charlie_pace You don't know me !
charlie_pace I'm a bloody rock god !
hugo_reyes Oh , no .
hugo_reyes Charlie , where's Jack ?
hugo_reyes Where's Jack ?
hugo_reyes Jack , Jack can you hear me ?
charlie_pace I don't know what happened .
charlie_pace We were just talking and it -- and it came down on us --
charlie_pace all happened so fast .
hugo_reyes Dude , we gotta get help .
hugo_reyes Charlie , go down to the beach and get help .
charlie_pace Okay , I'm on it .
hugo_reyes And make sure you tell Kate !
kate_austen What we're doing -- chasing some phantom distress signal -- what are the odds of this working ?
sayid_jarrah No worse than the odds of our surviving that plane crash .
kate_austen People survive plane crashes all the time .
sayid_jarrah Not like this one .
sayid_jarrah The tail section broke off while we were still in the air .
sayid_jarrah Our section cart wheeled through the jungle and yet we escaped with nothing but a few scrapes .
sayid_jarrah How do you explain that ?
kate_austen Blind , dumb luck ?
sayid_jarrah No one's that lucky .
sayid_jarrah We shouldn't have survived .
kate_austen Sorry , Sayid , some things just happen , no rhyme , no reason .
charlie_pace Hey , hey , we need help .
michael_dawson What's wrong , man ?
charlie_pace It's Jack , he's trapped .
boone_carlyle What ?
charlie_pace A cave collapsed .
charlie_pace We don't even know if he's alive .
charlie_pace Come on , we've gotta go .
michael_dawson Hey , uh , uh , Scott ?
steve_jenkins I'm Steve .
scott_jackson I'm Scott .
michael_dawson We've got an emergency , grab a couple of guys and let's go .
charlie_pace We've got to go now .
boone_carlyle Shannon , you have to be ready to do something really important , okay ?
boone_carlyle At 5 o'clock sharp you have to be ready to turn that antenna on over there .
boone_carlyle There's a switch at the base .
shannon_rutherford Why ?
boone_carlyle Because Kate and Sayid are triangulating the French signal .
boone_carlyle But the antenna's power's really weak
boone_carlyle so you have to wait until they fire their bottle rockets .
boone_carlyle Then you fire this one .
boone_carlyle Then you turn on the antenna .
boone_carlyle Got it ?
shannon_rutherford The switch is where now ?
boone_carlyle Did you hear a word I said ?
boone_carlyle Can you or can't you do it ?
shannon_rutherford Yeah , I can .
boone_carlyle Okay , okay .
charlie_pace Wait .
charlie_pace Kate .
charlie_pace Hey , we have to tell Kate about Jack .
james_ford Sorry sport , you just missed her .
james_ford Her and Mohammad headed into the woods about 10 minutes ago .
charlie_pace Which way ?
james_ford Don't sweat it , amigo .
james_ford I know which way they went .
charlie_pace Yeah , but-
james_ford I'll tell her .
james_ford You just keep doing ...
james_ford whatever it is you do around here .
charlie_pace What the hell was that ?
liam_pace That was another kick ass show .
liam_pace You were bloody brilliant .
charlie_pace I sing the chorus to You All Everybody .
liam_pace Oh yeah , sorry about that . .
liam_pace Got caught up in the moment .
liam_pace The crowd wanted it , you know .
charlie_pace Yeah , I know .
charlie_pace If I start and then you come in after me ...
liam_pace She's cool .
liam_pace Let her in .
liam_pace I won't let it happen again .
liam_pace I promise .
liam_pace Chill , baby brother .
michael_dawson Wait .
michael_dawson Hey wait .
hugo_reyes Jack's in there .
michael_dawson Let me check it out before you start moving things around .
michael_dawson If it's unstable ...
hugo_reyes Well , how do you know-
michael_dawson 8 years of construction work .
michael_dawson Hey Walt , get back , man
michael_dawson , I don't want you near the rocks , okay , and take the dog with you .
walt_lloyd You guys need Mr .
walt_lloyd Locke .
hugo_reyes Locke's out in the jungle killing stuff .
hugo_reyes Who knows where he is .
michael_dawson Alright , this area here is load-bearing .
michael_dawson We've got to dig where there's no danger of the wall buckling in on itself .
michael_dawson Here , we dig in here so the wall doesn't collapse .
michael_dawson Four at a time , by hand , until we can find some kind of shovel .
michael_dawson We take shifts , and go slow .
michael_dawson Whoever isn't digging should be clearing the rocks that we clear out and bring the water to whoever is working , okay .
michael_dawson Let's move .
james_ford Hey .
kate_austen What the hell are you doing here ?
james_ford Easy .
james_ford Just came to tell you something .
kate_austen What makes you think I'm interested in anything you have to say ?
james_ford Just came to tell you , you were right about me that I don't help anyone but myself .
james_ford Well , here I am , ready to pitch in .
kate_austen You're here to help ?
james_ford Hey , you act anymore surprised and I'm going to get offended .
john_locke Something wrong , Charlie ?
charlie_pace Yeah , Jack .
charlie_pace He's a -- there's been an accident at the caves .
charlie_pace Jack's trapped in a cave-in .
john_locke Is anyone trying to get him out ?
charlie_pace Yeah , there's a bunch of people there now .
john_locke Then why aren't you with them ?
john_locke You didn't come here to tell me about Jack , did you ?
charlie_pace I want my stash , Locke .
charlie_pace I can't stand feeling like this .
john_locke Come here .
john_locke Let me show you something . .
john_locke What do you suppose is in that cocoon , Charlie ?
charlie_pace I don't know , a butterfly , I guess ?
john_locke No , it's much more beautiful than that .
john_locke That's a moth cocoon .
john_locke It's ironic , butterflies get all the attention ; but moths -- they spin silk ,
john_locke they're stronger , they're faster .
charlie_pace That's wonderful , but ...
john_locke You see this little hole ?
john_locke This moth's just about to emerge .
john_locke It's in there right now , struggling .
john_locke It's digging its way through the thick hide of the cocoon .
john_locke Now , I could help it , take my knife , gently widen the opening , and the moth would be free .
john_locke But it would be too weak to survive .
john_locke The struggle is nature's way of strengthening it .
john_locke Now this is the second time you've asked me for your drugs back .
john_locke Ask me again and it's yours .
michael_dawson Hey , we're through , we got a hole .
hugo_reyes Jack ?
hugo_reyes Jack ?
hugo_reyes Can you hear me , Jack ?
hugo_reyes Come on dude , answer me .
hugo_reyes I hear him .
boone_carlyle He's alive .
hugo_reyes Jack , bro ,
hugo_reyes you okay ?
dr_jack_shephard I'm pinned .
dr_jack_shephard I can't move .
dr_jack_shephard I can't move .
hugo_reyes What do we do ?
hugo_reyes How do we get him out ?
dr_jack_shephard Charlie was with me .
hugo_reyes He's okay .
hugo_reyes He made it out .
michael_dawson Hey listen , Jack , we're going to get you out of there , okay ?
sayid_jarrah We'll place the second antenna here .
sayid_jarrah You want to help ?
sayid_jarrah Attach this antenna up in that tree , as high up as you can .
james_ford Golly , thanks , boss . .
sayid_jarrah Five o'clock .
sayid_jarrah Watch for my flare , then it's your turn .
sayid_jarrah I don't trust him .
kate_austen Who does ?
sayid_jarrah I don't trust him with you .
kate_austen I can handle him .
michael_dawson Okay , we can't safely make that tunnel any bigger , but since Jack can't get out , one of us is going to have to go in and un-pin him .
hugo_reyes What , crawl through that ?
boone_carlyle I think we need someone smaller .
hugo_reyes Dude , we don't understand Chinese .
michael_dawson Korean , man .
michael_dawson They're Korean .
charlie_pace I'll do it .
hugo_reyes Charlie ?
michael_dawson No , man .
michael_dawson Look , you're still too shook up .
michael_dawson I might be able to squeeze through ...
charlie_pace Hey , who's going to take care of your son if something happens .
charlie_pace She's got a husband , he's got a sister .
charlie_pace I'm alone here , no one on the Island .
charlie_pace Let me do this .
james_ford Still ain't five , just like the last time you checked your watch .
kate_austen I just don't want to miss Sayid's signal .
kate_austen Remember , I'll fire the flare , you set off the antenna .
james_ford I just thank the good lord I've got you here to keep reminding me .
kate_austen It's a dirty job , but somebody's got to do it .
james_ford So what is it about that guy -- Jack .
james_ford What it is about him makes you all weak in the loins .
kate_austen Do you try to be a pig , or does it just come naturally ?
james_ford So , he's a doctor , right ?
james_ford Yeah , the ladies dig the doctors .
james_ford Hell , give me a couple of band aids , a bottle of peroxide , I could run this Island too .
kate_austen You're actually comparing yourself to Jack ?
james_ford The difference between us ain't that big , sweetheart .
james_ford I guarantee you , if he had survived a few more weeks on this Island you'd have figured that out .
kate_austen What did you just say ?
james_ford Ah , damn .
james_ford Didn't I tell you ?
james_ford Word from the valley is
james_ford Saint Jack got himself buried in a cave-in .
kate_austen What ?
james_ford Look at the bright side , now you have someone else to pity .
michael_dawson Listen , man , go slow .
michael_dawson Try not to nudge any of the rocks around you .
charlie_pace Anything else ?
michael_dawson Yeah , good luck .
boone_carlyle Be safe man .
hugo_reyes Good luck , Charlie .
charlie_pace Alright , thanks guys .
liam_pace Everybody wants more , everybody wants to have a piece .
liam_pace All these people , they can't leave you alone when you're ...
charlie_pace Bloody hell .
liam_pace Hey , baby brother , grab a bird and sit down .
charlie_pace Get out .
charlie_pace You too , get out .
liam_pace Oh , I spilled on myself .
charlie_pace Out !
liam_pace Out ?
charlie_pace Come on , now !
liam_pace Come back in five minutes .
charlie_pace Sound check , you missed sound check , you don't show up for rehearsal .
charlie_pace We've got a show in an hour .
liam_pace Oooh , show .
liam_pace I like shows .
charlie_pace Alright , that's it .
charlie_pace After tonight , we cancel the rest of the tour .
liam_pace What ?
charlie_pace We walk away .
liam_pace Are you off your head ?
charlie_pace We're walking away like we said we would if things got ...
liam_pace Walk away and go where ?
charlie_pace Liam , you're killing yourself with this junk , you're destroying Drive Shaft !
liam_pace I am Drive Shaft !
liam_pace Nobody even knows who the sodding bass player is !
liam_pace This is it , Charlie -- end of the rainbow .
liam_pace You really think you can walk away ?
liam_pace Then what , eh ?
liam_pace Face it , if you're not in this band , what the bloody hell use are you ?
charlie_pace Liam ?
liam_pace Piss off !
michael_dawson Charlie ?
michael_dawson Charlie move !
michael_dawson Charlie ?
charlie_pace Hi .
charlie_pace I'm ...
charlie_pace I'm here to rescue you .
hugo_reyes I say we try again .
boone_carlyle We can't just leave them .
hugo_reyes If we don't move , they're going to run out of air .
michael_dawson Would you stop talking , I'm trying to think .
kate_austen Where is he ?
kate_austen Where is he ?
michael_dawson Kate .
kate_austen Where is he ?
kate_austen Where's Jack ?
hugo_reyes He's in there .
kate_austen Does anyone know if he's alive ?
kate_austen Is he alive ?
michael_dawson We don't know .
michael_dawson Charlie went in there through a tunnel that we dug , but it collapsed .
kate_austen Why is nobody digging ?
charlie_pace Okay , one , two , three . .
charlie_pace Sorry , Jack .
charlie_pace Sorry .
charlie_pace You alright ?
dr_jack_shephard My shoulder's dislocated .
charlie_pace What ?
dr_jack_shephard You're going to have to pop it back in .
charlie_pace No , I can't .
dr_jack_shephard I need your help on this , man .
charlie_pace I can't do it , Jack .
dr_jack_shephard Yes you can .
dr_jack_shephard Yes you can .
charlie_pace Okay ,
charlie_pace what do I -- what do I do ?
dr_jack_shephard Take my hand ...
charlie_pace This hand ?
charlie_pace Okay , okay , wait , okay , okay .
dr_jack_shephard Now , when I tell you to , pull as hard as you possibly can .
charlie_pace Jack , I don't know , I don't , I don't ...
dr_jack_shephard You can do this , Charlie .
charlie_pace Okay , okay , okay , okay .
dr_jack_shephard Now .
liam_pace Charlie ?
liam_pace What are you doing here ?
charlie_pace A bloke can't pay his big brother a visit once in a while ?
liam_pace Of course you can .
liam_pace Why didn't you call , you lunatic . .
liam_pace What are you doing in Sydney ?
charlie_pace It's all lined up , Liam .
charlie_pace 8 weeks on tour opening for some band called Meat Coat .
charlie_pace First gig's in Los Angeles .
charlie_pace LA , Liam .
charlie_pace This is a chance to get back on a label , a real one .
charlie_pace This is our comeback .
liam_pace Charlie , I don't want to come back .
charlie_pace Yeah , right .
charlie_pace Well , here's the thing .
charlie_pace They won't book Drive Shaft without you .
charlie_pace So I'm asking as a brother , the way you asked me .
liam_pace You were with me the night I missed Megan's birth .
liam_pace You were the one I was stumbling around Dresden with trying to find a sodding fix .
liam_pace Oh man , you're still using , aren't you ?
charlie_pace Don't change the subject .
liam_pace That's why you haven't been returning my calls .
charlie_pace Look , are you going to go on tour with us or not ?
liam_pace You said you were going to get some help , man .
charlie_pace I lost your sodding number ,
charlie_pace okay ?
liam_pace You're still a junkie .
charlie_pace You did this to me !
charlie_pace It was about the music !
charlie_pace The music , Liam .
charlie_pace You took that away from me .
liam_pace Listen , why don't you stay with us for a few weeks .
liam_pace Karen and me , we can get you help .
liam_pace Sydney's got some really good programs .
charlie_pace Forget it .
liam_pace Don't go .
charlie_pace Thanks for your help , brother .
liam_pace Stay , please .
liam_pace I'm just looking out for you !
charlie_pace You never looked out for me !
charlie_pace I have a plane to catch .
dr_jack_shephard How long has it been , Charlie ?
charlie_pace I don't know what you're going on about .
dr_jack_shephard How long since your last fix ?
charlie_pace Almost a day and a half .
dr_jack_shephard How's the withdrawal treating you ?
dr_jack_shephard Any hallucinations ?
charlie_pace Apart from the conversation I had with you about an hour ago in the jungle , no , not really .
dr_jack_shephard Why didn't you say anything ?
dr_jack_shephard I could've helped you through this .
charlie_pace Yeah , you think I'm useless , and a junkie to boot .
dr_jack_shephard Useless ?
dr_jack_shephard You're not useless .
dr_jack_shephard That took a lot of guts getting in here and trying to rescue me .
dr_jack_shephard I won't forget that .
charlie_pace For the rest of our lives ?
dr_jack_shephard At the rate we're using our oxygen in here , that won't be too long .
charlie_pace This place , it reminds me of confession , those little claustrophobic booths .
dr_jack_shephard I wouldn't have taken you for a religious man .
charlie_pace I used to be .
charlie_pace Hey , you want to hear my confession ?
charlie_pace Might take a while .
dr_jack_shephard Hey , I'm no saint , either .
dr_jack_shephard What's wrong ?
charlie_pace It's a moth .
dr_jack_shephard A what ?
charlie_pace Right behind you , look .

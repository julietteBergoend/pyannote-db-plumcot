james_ford Hell of a book .
james_ford It's about bunnies .
kate_austen Must be cold without your trunks .
james_ford You bet .

kate_austen You sure know how to make a girl feel special , Sawyer .
jessica You're incredible Sawyer .
james_ford I love you .
james_ford Look at you .
james_ford What do you want , right now ?
jessica How could I want anything else ?
jessica Oh , uh-oh , baby .
james_ford Oh , what .
jessica I thought you had a meeting .

james_ford Damn it .
james_ford Baby ,

jessica No , just go .
jessica You go ,
jessica okay , I'll stay here -- order room service , get fat .
james_ford Why don't you order a chocolate sundae -- when I get back , I'll use you as a dish .
james_ford You weren't exactly supposed to see that .
james_ford What are you doing in my stuff , son ?
dr_jack_shephard This is going to hurt .
dr_jack_shephard Ready to tell me what happened ?
sayid_jarrah We were trying to find the source of the distress call .
sayid_jarrah I saw the flare from the beach and then the flare from Sawyer's position in the jungle .
sayid_jarrah I switched on my antenna , activated the transceiver , and then -- darkness .
sayid_jarrah Whoever hit me came from behind .
dr_jack_shephard And destroyed the equipment ?
sayid_jarrah Yes .
dr_jack_shephard Listen , we're going to figure this out , but don't do anything ...
sayid_jarrah I will do whatever I need to do to find the man responsible .
shannon_rutherford We need some help over here .
dr_jack_shephard What happened ?
boone_carlyle Sawyer .
charlie_pace Morning delivery .
claire_littleton Awww , you're sweet , thanks .
charlie_pace Well , I figured in your condition , with the extra baggage , you know ...
claire_littleton Well , I can still walk .
charlie_pace Barely .
charlie_pace Anyway , I worry about you out here .
charlie_pace You know , it's very -- sunny .
claire_littleton Thus , my hat .
charlie_pace There's plenty of hats in the caves .
charlie_pace And we've got a doctor there , as well .
charlie_pace That'll come in handy .
claire_littleton I like the beach , Charlie .
charlie_pace Yeah , who wouldn't want to spend the day with sand fleas .
claire_littleton I want to be here -- for when we get rescued .
charlie_pace When we get rescued , right .
boone_carlyle Jack , it's fine .
boone_carlyle It's just a scrape .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , lot's of scrapes today .
dr_jack_shephard I'm running out of peroxide .
boone_carlyle He just jumped me man .
boone_carlyle I didn't ...
dr_jack_shephard Why ?
boone_carlyle Shannon has asthma .
dr_jack_shephard Asthma ?
boone_carlyle Yeah .
dr_jack_shephard I've never seen her have an attack before .
boone_carlyle Because she had an inhaler .
boone_carlyle She's sneaks hits when no one's looking .
boone_carlyle She's been embarrassed about it since she was a little kid .
boone_carlyle I guess breathing's not cool .
dr_jack_shephard Had an inhaler ?
boone_carlyle It ran out a couple of days ago .
boone_carlyle But I had 4 refills which should have been enough for a couple of months .
boone_carlyle But she always forgets her medication
boone_carlyle so I put it my suitcase .
boone_carlyle Today I see that jackass reading Watership Down .
dr_jack_shephard You're losing me .
boone_carlyle It was in my bags , the stuff that I checked .
boone_carlyle If he has my book he has my luggage , if he has the luggage he has the inhalers .
boone_carlyle Her breathing got really rough today , man .
boone_carlyle If she has an attack , it's not going to be good .
dr_jack_shephard Where is it ?
james_ford Hey , Doc .
james_ford Long time no see .
dr_jack_shephard Where is it ?
james_ford Where's what ?
dr_jack_shephard The girl's asthma medicine .
dr_jack_shephard Shannon -- her inhalers .
james_ford Oh , that .
dr_jack_shephard You attacked a kid for trying to help his sick sister .
james_ford No , I whooped a thief cuz he was going through my stuff .
dr_jack_shephard Yours ?
dr_jack_shephard What makes it yours ?
dr_jack_shephard What , you think you can just take something out of a suitcase and that makes it yours ?
james_ford Which I had to move because everybody just wants to help themselves .
james_ford Look , I don't know what kind of commie share-fest you're running over in cave town , but down here possession's 9/10ths .
james_ford And a man's got a right to protect his property .
dr_jack_shephard Get up .
james_ford Why , you want to see who's taller ?
dr_jack_shephard Get up .
james_ford You sure you want to make this your problem , Doc ?
dr_jack_shephard Oh yeah .
dr_jack_shephard I'm sure .
kate_austen Hey , what's going on here ?
jessica You told me you were going to Baton Rouge to close a deal .
james_ford Just trust me , there isn't any time to explain .
james_ford I'm already late .
james_ford I miss this meeting , the whole deal's a bust , alright ?
james_ford That's everything I have .
james_ford 140,000 dollars .
james_ford There's an oil mining operation in the Gulf of Mexico -- drilling platforms .
james_ford 300,000 dollars buys one share , but as soon as you invest a Government sponsored fund kicks in and triples your money in two weeks .
james_ford Triples it .
jessica 300,000 ?
james_ford Yeah .
jessica You've got 140 .
james_ford I found an investor in Toronto -- wants in 50/50 .
james_ford In two weeks we'll be splitting almost a million bucks .
james_ford Jess , this is my chance .
jessica There's another option .
james_ford Yeah ,
james_ford and what's that ?
jessica That I give you the 160,000 and we split the profit .
james_ford Yeah ,
james_ford and how in the hell are you going to scare up 160,000 bucks ?
jessica My husband .
dr_jack_shephard I'm going to kill him .
kate_austen That's not going to help us get the medicine .
dr_jack_shephard Maybe not , but it'll feel good .
kate_austen So what's stopping you ?
dr_jack_shephard We're not savages , Kate .
dr_jack_shephard Not yet .
kate_austen Let me talk to Sawyer .
dr_jack_shephard What makes you think he's going to listen to you ?
kate_austen He says we have a connection .
dr_jack_shephard Do you ?
kate_austen Please .
kate_austen What do you want ?
james_ford Excuse me ?
kate_austen What do you want , Sawyer ?
james_ford Freckles , I got so many answers to that question , I wouldn't even know where to start .
kate_austen What do you want for the inhalers ?
james_ford Ah , good question .
james_ford Hang on a tick .
james_ford What do I want ?
james_ford A kiss ought to do it .
kate_austen What ?
james_ford A kiss , from you , right now ?
kate_austen I don't buy it .
james_ford Buy what ?
kate_austen The act .
kate_austen You try too hard , Sawyer .
kate_austen I ask you to help a woman who can't breath
kate_austen and you want me to kiss you ?
kate_austen Nobody's that disgusting .
kate_austen I've seen you , you know .
james_ford Seen me what ?
kate_austen With that piece of paper -- the one you keep in your pocket .
kate_austen Seen the expression on your face when you read it and how carefully you fold it up .
kate_austen It means something to you .
kate_austen So you can play games all you want , but
kate_austen I know there's a human being in there somewhere .
kate_austen Give me the medication .
james_ford You think you understand me ?
kate_austen Yeah .
kate_austen I think I have ...
james_ford Shut up .
james_ford You want to know what kind of human being I am ?
james_ford Read it .
james_ford Read it .
james_ford Out loud .
kate_austen Dear Mr .
kate_austen Sawyer , you don't know who I am
kate_austen but I know who you are
kate_austen and I know what you done .
kate_austen You had sex with my mother and then you stole my dad's money all away .
kate_austen So he got angry and he killed my mother
kate_austen and then he killed himself , too .
james_ford Don't stop now .
james_ford You're just getting to the good part .
kate_austen All I know is your name .
kate_austen But one of these days I'm going to find you
kate_austen and I'm going to give you this letter
kate_austen so you'll remember what you done to me .
kate_austen You killed my parents , Mr . Sawyer .
james_ford Now about that kiss ... I didn't think so .
sayid_jarrah Locke , where were you last night , around sunset ?
john_locke Well , I'm afraid the only witness to my whereabouts is the boar that I was skinning for our dinner .
john_locke I heard you were trying to send out a distress call .
john_locke So it would seem whoever attacked you has a reason for not wanting to get off the Island .
john_locke Maybe someone who is profiting from our current circumstances ?
john_locke And from what I've seen you and Mr .
john_locke Sawyer share a certain animosity .
sayid_jarrah No , he has an alibi .
sayid_jarrah Just before I was struck , he set off a bottle rocket , a signal we had worked out -- 2 kilometers away .
sayid_jarrah He wouldn't have the time to go ...
john_locke Unless he found a way to time delay the fuse on his rocket .
sayid_jarrah How could he possibly have ...
john_locke Anyone who watches television knows how to improvise a slow fuse .
john_locke Use a cigarette .
john_locke Just in case there's a next time .
boone_carlyle Just try to breathe .
boone_carlyle Breathe .
boone_carlyle Come on Shann work with me .
dr_jack_shephard Give me the inhalers -- now .
james_ford Hell , I wondered when you were going to stop asking nice .
james_ford Well , it's about time , cowboy .
james_ford Been telling you since day one , we're in the wild .
james_ford Didn't think you had it in you .
james_ford That all you got ?
james_ford I'm not sure this is such a good idea .
jessica Why not ?
james_ford Because business between friends is always a little sticky .
james_ford I don't know you well ,
james_ford but I know your wife .
james_ford Working with her at the auto dealership , I'm just not sure I'm comfortable .
david Louisiana will invest two thirds of the drilling costs .
david What is this ?
david A loophole ?
james_ford Look , David , you're reluctant .
james_ford I get it .
james_ford You got your lumbar yard , you don't need this .
jessica You should do this .
david Jess , I don't even know this guy .
jessica Show him the cash .
david How do I know this is real ?
james_ford The money ?
james_ford Hell , how about you hold on to it for a night .
james_ford Check it out .
james_ford I want you to feel secure .
james_ford You know what ?
james_ford Let's not do this .
james_ford I've got another investor who's already committed .
jessica David ?
james_ford This should cover lunch .
james_ford And I'll see you Monday .
james_ford David .
jessica David ?
david Wait .
claire_littleton Warm fluffy towels .
claire_littleton Your turn .
charlie_pace Uh , banoffee pie .
claire_littleton You already said that .
charlie_pace Toffee and cream , mmmm .
claire_littleton Is food the only thing that you miss ?
charlie_pace You're pregnant .
charlie_pace I mean , do you not crave anything ?
charlie_pace Pickles , fried ice cream , chocolate ?
claire_littleton Peanut butter .
claire_littleton I'm the only Australian who loves peanut butter .
charlie_pace I could get you peanut butter .
claire_littleton Yeah , sure you can .
charlie_pace Yes , I can .
charlie_pace And when I get you peanut butter you have to vacate this sandy shore of depression and move to the caves .
charlie_pace Deal ?
claire_littleton Deal .
boone_carlyle Help , she's not breathing !
boone_carlyle The attacks are getting worse .
dr_jack_shephard Shannon , listen to me .
dr_jack_shephard Look at me , look at me .
dr_jack_shephard You need to listen now .
dr_jack_shephard This isn't just the asthma , it's anxiety .
dr_jack_shephard It's in your head .
shannon_rutherford No .
dr_jack_shephard Yes .
dr_jack_shephard You know that your medicine's run out
dr_jack_shephard and you're panicking .
dr_jack_shephard Shannon , Shannon , look at me .
dr_jack_shephard We can fight this , together , okay ?
dr_jack_shephard Nod your head , Shannon .
dr_jack_shephard Good .
dr_jack_shephard Breathe in through ...
boone_carlyle She needs her inhaler .
dr_jack_shephard Boone !
dr_jack_shephard Breathe in through your nose , slowly .
dr_jack_shephard No , no , no .
dr_jack_shephard In through the nose , like this .
dr_jack_shephard You can do this Shannon .
dr_jack_shephard You can do it .
dr_jack_shephard In through the nose .
dr_jack_shephard You got your breath .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
dr_jack_shephard Your color's coming back .
dr_jack_shephard See , I knew you could do this .
dr_jack_shephard Do you feel it ?
shannon_rutherford Yes .
dr_jack_shephard It's passing .
dr_jack_shephard Okay .
dr_jack_shephard Again , in through the nose .
dr_jack_shephard Alright , just keep doing that .
dr_jack_shephard Keep breathing like that .
dr_jack_shephard That's perfect , good job .
dr_jack_shephard Keep her relaxed .
dr_jack_shephard Do not let her panic .
boone_carlyle Yeah .
boone_carlyle Yeah .
hugo_reyes Wow , man .
hugo_reyes That was awesome .
hugo_reyes I mean , that was like a -- Jedi moment .
sayid_jarrah Jack , what will happen if she doesn't get the medicine ?
sayid_jarrah Then we have to make Sawyer give it to us .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , that's what I'm going to do .
sayid_jarrah No , not you , me .
sayid_jarrah I served 5 years in the Republican Guard .
dr_jack_shephard I thought you were a communications officer ?
sayid_jarrah Part of my training entailed getting the enemy to communicate .
sayid_jarrah Just give me 10 minutes with him .
sayid_jarrah He'll give us the medicine .
sayid_jarrah Is that a yes ?
dr_jack_shephard Yes .
hugo_reyes Food from the plane's been gone for over a week , dude .
charlie_pace What , no secret stash for emergencies ?
charlie_pace You and Jack have got a bunch of stuff in that cave .
hugo_reyes Sorry , man .
hugo_reyes No peanut butter .
hugo_reyes No peanuts .
hugo_reyes No nothing .
charlie_pace Yeah ,
charlie_pace but , there's got to be something .
charlie_pace I mean , look at you .
hugo_reyes Look at what ?
charlie_pace No , no .
charlie_pace Listen .
hugo_reyes Fat guy hoarding the food , is that what you think ?
charlie_pace No .
charlie_pace It's just we've been here for two weeks
charlie_pace and you've not really ...
hugo_reyes Slimmed down much ?
charlie_pace All I need is a bag of peanuts .
hugo_reyes I have no food , alright? !
hugo_reyes And for the record , I'm down a notch in my belt .
hugo_reyes I'm a big guy , it's going to be a while before you're going to want to give me a piggy back ride ,
hugo_reyes okay ?
charlie_pace Sorry .
charlie_pace Sorry , that was bad form .
hugo_reyes Yeah .
hugo_reyes I'm used to it .
charlie_pace So , not even a bag of ...
hugo_reyes Dude .
charlie_pace Okay .
charlie_pace Alright , I'm sorry .
michael_dawson Aaah , damn , stupid ...
sunhwa_kwon Michael -- the sick girl .
michael_dawson Yeah .
michael_dawson Asthma .
sunhwa_kwon Yes , asthma .
sunhwa_kwon I think I can help her .
sayid_jarrah Good morning .
kate_austen What are you doing ?
kate_austen Jack !
dr_jack_shephard This was Sawyer's choice , not mine .
kate_austen If you do this !
james_ford Well , ain't you the brave one , jumping a guy while he's napping .
james_ford Uh-oh , I'm in trouble now , ain't I ?
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer , I'm giving you the chance to do the right thing .
dr_jack_shephard Now , all I want is the asthma medicine .
dr_jack_shephard Just tell me where the inhalers are and we'll stop .
james_ford Stop what , Chico ?
dr_jack_shephard It doesn't have to be this way .
james_ford Yeah , it does .
sayid_jarrah We do not have bamboo in Iraq , although we do have something similar -- reeds .
sayid_jarrah But their effect is the same when the shoots are inserted underneath the fingernails .
james_ford You know what I think , Ali .
james_ford I think you've never actually tortured anybody in your life .
sayid_jarrah Unfortunately for us both , you're wrong .
james_ford That's it ?
james_ford That's all you got ?
james_ford Splinters ?
james_ford No wonder we kicked your ass in the Gulf ...
dr_jack_shephard Sayid .
dr_jack_shephard Sayid !
james_ford No .
james_ford Don't stop now .
james_ford I think my sinuses are clearing .
dr_jack_shephard What the hell is wrong with you ?
sayid_jarrah Perhaps losing an eye will loosen your tongue ?
james_ford Okay , okay .
sayid_jarrah Where is it ?
james_ford The only person I'll tell is her .
dr_jack_shephard Kate ?
james_ford That's the deal .
kilo Tell me Sawyer , do you want to die ?
kilo Because when a man walks in my place and tells me he left a 160,000 of my hard won dollars in the care of a civilian I've got to ask myself if what I'm hearing isn't the desperate cry for the sweet release of death .
james_ford Deal closed today .
james_ford See , women are easy -- a few cosmos , a couple of stunts they haven't seen between the sheets , and they think the scam's their idea .
james_ford Now husbands , they need to touch the money , smell it --
james_ford believe that if they had the brass to put that suitcase in the trunk of their family sedan and speed away , they just might have a chance at being an honest-to-gosh outlaw .
kilo Okay , Tex .
kilo You got your grift so pat ,
kilo what'd you need my money for ?
kilo Where's your seed from the last couple you roped ?
james_ford Well , what can I say ?
james_ford I like earning it as much as I like spending it .
kilo Be that as it may , I know a thing or two about making people suffer .
kilo Now you have my money , plus 50% , by noon tomorrow
kilo or I'll tell you all about it .
kate_austen So I'm here .
kate_austen Where is it ?
james_ford Happy to tell you , as soon as I get that kiss .
kate_austen What ?
kate_austen Are you serious ?
james_ford Baby , I am tied to a tree in a jungle of mystery .
james_ford I just got tortured by a damn spinal surgeon and a gen-u-ine I-raqi .
james_ford Of course , I'm serious .
james_ford You're just not seeing the big picture here , Freckles .
james_ford You really going to let that girl suffocate because you can't bring yourself to give me one little kiss ?
james_ford Hell , it's only first base .
james_ford Lucky for you
james_ford I ain't greedy .
kate_austen Okay .
james_ford Okay .
james_ford I don't have it .
kate_austen What ?
james_ford The medicine .
james_ford I don't have it , never did .
kate_austen The book -- they said you found it in their luggage .
james_ford The book washed up on shore , went in the drink with the rest
james_ford of-
kate_austen He doesn't have it .
dr_jack_shephard What ?
sayid_jarrah He's lying .
sayid_jarrah Can't you see that ?
sayid_jarrah He's been lying from the beginning .
sayid_jarrah He doesn't want us to get off this Island .
sayid_jarrah That's why he attacked me .
dr_jack_shephard Hold on a minute .
sayid_jarrah He destroyed the transceiver !
dr_jack_shephard You don't know that .
dr_jack_shephard Sayid !
dr_jack_shephard You hit an artery .
dr_jack_shephard Keep still damn it .
dr_jack_shephard Sayid , I need my stuff from the caves , my leather backpack .
dr_jack_shephard Go .
kate_austen Can you make it stop ?
boone_carlyle Whose blood is that ?
boone_carlyle Whose blood is that ?
sayid_jarrah Sawyer .
boone_carlyle You went after Sawyer and you didn't even tell me ?
boone_carlyle She's my sister .
shannon_rutherford Boone , don't leave me alone , okay ?
boone_carlyle I'm not going anywhere , okay ?
shannon_rutherford Okay .
michael_dawson Are these the right ones ?
michael_dawson I think I found the right tree , but I'm guessing .
sunhwa_kwon Just let me see .
sunhwa_kwon Oh yes , good .
jinsoo_kwon What's going on?)
michael_dawson Don't , man .
james_ford Let go .
james_ford I know you want to .
dr_jack_shephard Shut up .
dr_jack_shephard And stop moving .
james_ford You've been waiting for this , haven't you ?
james_ford Now you get to be the hero again , because that's what you do -- fix everything up all nice .
james_ford Tell him to let go , Freckles .
james_ford We already made out , what else I got to live for ?
james_ford Hey , Jack , there's something you should know
james_ford -- if the tables were turned , I'd watch you die .
james_ford Alrighty .
james_ford It looks like we're in the oil business .
david We're cool ?
james_ford Oh , we're cool .
david We get the money back ?
james_ford Week from tomorrow , tripled .
david You're not going to skip town , are you ?
jessica David , for god's sake , he left all his money with us .
jessica We could've skipped town .
james_ford Smart woman you got there , David .
james_ford Don't let her go .
jessica Hi , baby .
jessica What are you doing up ?
jessica Are you feeling better ?
boy Will you read to me ?
jessica In a minute sweetheart .
jessica We have company right now .
david You
david okay ?
james_ford Deal's off .
david Excuse me ?
james_ford Deal's off , forget it .
jessica What are you doing ?
david Hold on , what is this , a joke ?
james_ford I'm calling it off , walking away .
david You're not walking out of here .
david You know what I had to do for this ?
david All this money in one day? !
james_ford Take your hand off me , boy .
jessica Sawyer ?
david What's going on here ?
jessica This isn't how is was supposed to work .
jessica You said that we were ... !
david Said ?
david What'd he say Jessica ?
kate_austen You're lucky to be alive .
james_ford Jack ?
kate_austen Went to the caves to check on Shannon .
kate_austen I read it again , and then again , because I've been trying to figure out why you beat up Boone instead of just telling him you didn't have his sister's medication .
kate_austen Why you pretended to have it anyway .
kate_austen The thing that I keep coming back around to is that you want to be hated .
kate_austen Then I looked at the envelope -- America's bicentennial , Knoxville , TN .
kate_austen You were just a kid , 8 maybe 9 years old .
james_ford Kate .
kate_austen This letter wasn't written to you .
kate_austen You wrote this letter .
kate_austen Your name's not Sawyer , is it ?
james_ford It was his name .
james_ford He was a confidence man .
james_ford Romanced my momma to get to the money , wiped them out clean , left a mess behind .
james_ford So I wrote that letter .
james_ford I wrote it knowing one day I'd find him .
james_ford But that ain't the sad part .
james_ford When I was 19 , I needed 6 grand to pay these guys off
james_ford I was in trouble with .
james_ford So I found a pretty lady with a dumb husband who had some money .
james_ford And I got them to give it to me .
james_ford How's that for a tragedy ?
james_ford I became the man I was hunting .
james_ford Became Sawyer .
james_ford Don't you feel sorry for me . .
james_ford Get the hell out .
james_ford Get out !
boone_carlyle I don't know .
boone_carlyle It's a miracle .
boone_carlyle She just showed up with that mixture .
boone_carlyle She rubbed it on Shannon's chest and 10 minutes later she was breathing .
dr_jack_shephard Eucalyptus -- smart , Jack .
dr_jack_shephard Thank you , very much .
claire_littleton What are you doing ?
charlie_pace Packing your stuff , you're moving to the caves .
claire_littleton You didn't ?
claire_littleton Peanut butter ?
claire_littleton No way .
charlie_pace Just like you ordered .
charlie_pace Oh , there is one thing .
charlie_pace It's extra smooth .
claire_littleton That's okay .
claire_littleton It's empty .
charlie_pace What ?
charlie_pace No , no it's not .
charlie_pace It's full , full to the brim , with stick to the roof of your mouth , oh , god , makes you want a glass of milk extra smooth .
charlie_pace It's the best bloody peanut butter I've ever tasted .
charlie_pace You want some ?
kate_austen Sayid ?
sayid_jarrah I can't stay here .
kate_austen What ?
sayid_jarrah I'm leaving .
sayid_jarrah I don't know for how long .
kate_austen Sayid , you can't .
kate_austen We still don't know what's out there .
sayid_jarrah I've worse things to fear than what's in the jungle .
sayid_jarrah What I did today , what I almost did , I swore to do never again .
sayid_jarrah If I can't keep that promise , I have no right to be here .
kate_austen There's nowhere to go .
sayid_jarrah Someone has to walk the shore and map the Island , see what else there is .
sayid_jarrah I can't think of a better person to do it than the only one I trust .
sayid_jarrah I hope we meet again .

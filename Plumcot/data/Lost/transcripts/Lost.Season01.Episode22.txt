kate_austen Hi .
kate_austen I'm expecting a letter -- hold for guest arrival .
sanjay Sure , what's your name ?
kate_austen Joan Hart .
sanjay Oh , Joan Hart .
charlie_pace Platinum .
kate_austen Platinum ?
charlie_pace As in platinum record -- as in a million units sold .
charlie_pace Now , Drive Shaft's albums must have spiked when everybody found out that I died in some catastrophic plane disaster .
charlie_pace When I come back , alive , it's going to be insane .
kate_austen So you think the raft's going to work ?
charlie_pace Yeah , of course it will work , look at that thing .
charlie_pace It's not a raft .
charlie_pace They built a sodding boat .
charlie_pace And when they get picked up , the helicopters will come , making us ridiculously and eternally famous .
charlie_pace What's the matter , don't you want to be famous ?
kate_austen What do you think is going on over there ?
dr_leslie_arzt Sure , you can absolutely wait a few weeks before you launch .
dr_leslie_arzt I was just assuming you didn't want to die .
michael_dawson So , when is the next time we can launch ?
dr_leslie_arzt 3 , maybe 4 , months .
james_ford C'mon , even a weather man on TV don't know what's going to happen .
james_ford Why are we listening to Arzt ?
dr_leslie_arzt Because I'm a doctor , and you're a hillbilly .
james_ford You're a damn high school science teacher .
dr_jack_shephard Hey , Sawyer , just let the man talk .
dr_leslie_arzt It's been raining every afternoon .
dr_leslie_arzt That means that we are on the cusp on monsoon season .
dr_leslie_arzt Monsoon season is bad .
dr_leslie_arzt Now , the trade winds are blowing north right now -- shipping lanes are north -- so north is exactly where you want to be .
michael_dawson What does that mean ?
dr_leslie_arzt It means that when monsoon season hits the trade winds are going to shift to the south .
dr_leslie_arzt The raft goes with the wind .
dr_leslie_arzt Can anyone tell me what is the only piece of land that is south of us ?
dr_jack_shephard Antarctica .
dr_leslie_arzt That's right , Jack , Antarctica .
michael_dawson So , when do we have to leave ?
dr_leslie_arzt Yesterday .
kate_austen So obviously you believe him ?
michael_dawson Arzt ?
michael_dawson I don't know , but I'm not taking any chances .
kate_austen You think you'll be ready by tomorrow ?
michael_dawson The man said not a day to waste .
kate_austen Supplies all set ?
kate_austen You've got food , fresh water ?
michael_dawson Kate , no offense , but I've got work to do .
michael_dawson Why the sudden interest ?
kate_austen Because I'm going with you .
michael_dawson Look , the raft's full -- we need 4 , we got 4 .
kate_austen Including Sawyer ?
michael_dawson Including him .
michael_dawson We needed the stuff he had
michael_dawson so he bought his way on .
kate_austen To the first raft , which burned .
michael_dawson You know , I'm not going to get into semantics with you .
michael_dawson I told the guy ...
kate_austen He doesn't even know how to sail .
michael_dawson And you do ?
kate_austen I spent 2 summers crewing J boats .
kate_austen I know my way around a sailboat .
michael_dawson Yeah , maybe so , but a deal's a deal .
michael_dawson I'm sorry .
kate_austen You're bringing Walt , too ?
kate_austen I'm just saying it's dangerous .
michael_dawson I decide what's best for my boy .
michael_dawson And right now , what's best for him is to get the hell off this Island .
michael_dawson The raft's full .
HOSPITAL#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode22  Hospital chaplain to the neural ICU .

dr_tom_brennan I heard .
dr_tom_brennan I'm sorry .
kate_austen Yeah , me too .
dr_tom_brennan So any particular reason why you're hanging out in the back of my car ?
kate_austen I need your help .
dr_jack_shephard How much further ?
sayid_jarrah We're almost there .
dr_jack_shephard You want to tell me where we're going , Sayid ?
sayid_jarrah It's better that you see it for yourself .
dr_jack_shephard No , I'm not so sure that it is .
dr_jack_shephard Tell me why you brought me out here
dr_jack_shephard or I'm going to turn around .
john_locke He brought you out here because I asked him to .
john_locke I asked him not to tell you .
john_locke I wanted you to have an open mind .
dr_jack_shephard Open mind about what ?
dr_jack_shephard My god , what is this thing ?
john_locke Exactly .
john_locke I guess it's time we talked about this .
james_ford Yo , chief , dumb question here -- we're sailing out in the ocean , right ?
michael_dawson Do you mind ?
james_ford Sulu over here is packing a suitcase full of salted fish .
michael_dawson Yeah ?
james_ford We can't catch fish ?
michael_dawson Do you know anything about surviving at sea -- sailing , navigating , steering a raft ?
james_ford Do you ?
michael_dawson It doesn't matter what I know
michael_dawson , I built it .
michael_dawson Maybe you are the wrong guy to go on the raft .
james_ford You're going to vote me off , Mickey ?
james_ford And who the hell's going to take my place ?
james_ford What the hell do you think you're doing ?
kate_austen I'm sorry ?
james_ford Don't give me the awe-golly eyes .
james_ford Michael just told me you were jockeying for my spot on the raft .
kate_austen I was just asking some questions .
kate_austen He must have misunderstood me .
james_ford I know what you're doing .
kate_austen Yeah ?
james_ford Yeah , just like I know why you wanted that Halliburton case so bad -- the one that belonged to that U.S .
james_ford Marshal who was flying with us .
james_ford You were his prisoner .
kate_austen Let go of me .
james_ford The only chance of running is getting on that raft , ain't it ?
james_ford We get picked up by a ship and they come back to rescue the rest of you all -- there's going to be a nice big asterisk next to your name .
james_ford Don't worry puddin' , your secret's safe with me .
james_ford But just so you know -- no way in hell you're getting my spot on that raft .
kate_austen Hey Sawyer .
kate_austen I want your spot , I'll get your spot .
michael_dawson Hey , give me that water , man .
walt_lloyd Yo , dad .
michael_dawson Thanks .
walt_lloyd So what were you and Sawyer arguing about ?
michael_dawson I told him something he didn't want to hear .
walt_lloyd Why does he want to get on the raft so much ?
michael_dawson Because he knows it's going to work .
walt_lloyd When we get rescued we're going to come back for everybody else , right ?
michael_dawson Yeah , sure , of course .
michael_dawson The thing is -- this Island , uh , is , uh -- finding it again might be hard .
walt_lloyd Can't we fly around and look for it ?
michael_dawson Absolutely , but there's no guarantees .
michael_dawson That's why you and me-
walt_lloyd Dad ?
michael_dawson Oh .
michael_dawson That's why you and ...
walt_lloyd Dad !
walt_lloyd Dad !
michael_dawson Get Jack .
walt_lloyd Help !
walt_lloyd I need help .
walt_lloyd It's my dad .
kate_austen What's the matter ?
walt_lloyd His stomach is really bad .
kate_austen Take him back to Michael .
kate_austen I'll go get Jack .
sunhwa_kwon Okay .
sunhwa_kwon Let's go .
walt_lloyd This way .
kate_austen Jack !
kate_austen Jack !
dr_jack_shephard How long have you known about this ?
john_locke 3 weeks , give or take .
dr_jack_shephard 3 weeks .
dr_jack_shephard You've been out here for 3 weeks digging this thing up and you never told me about it ?
john_locke All due respect , Jack , but since when do I report to you ?
dr_jack_shephard All due respect , John , but you lied .
john_locke How long did you have that case full of guns before you decided the rest of us needed to know ?
john_locke You used your best discretion .
john_locke I used mine .
dr_jack_shephard So how do we open it ?
sayid_jarrah What ?
sayid_jarrah You want to open it ?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
sayid_jarrah We should bury it !
sayid_jarrah I brought you here to talk him out of this insanity .
sayid_jarrah Anything could be inside !
dr_jack_shephard Best case scenario there's supplies --
dr_jack_shephard worst case , we use it as a shelter .
sayid_jarrah Actually , Jack , I can think of much worse cases than that .
sayid_jarrah You notice anything about this hatch ?
sayid_jarrah There's no handle .
sayid_jarrah Could the reason for that be more obvious? !
sayid_jarrah Maybe it was never meant to be opened from the outside .
kate_austen Jack !
kate_austen Jack !
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , over here !
kate_austen It's Michael , something's wrong .
dr_jack_shephard What'd you eat today ?
michael_dawson Uh , fruit , fish .
dr_jack_shephard You drinking enough water ?
michael_dawson 2 or 3 bottles .
dr_jack_shephard Where are you getting that water from ?
michael_dawson You know , the caves , like everybody else .
dr_jack_shephard Alright , listen , Michael , just take it easy , okay ?
dr_jack_shephard You stay in the shade and try not to move too much , okay .
michael_dawson No .
michael_dawson We have to launch that raft tomorrow .
michael_dawson We have to .
dr_jack_shephard I know , I know .
dr_jack_shephard I need you to lay back .
kate_austen Lay down .
kate_austen Just lay down , okay .
dr_tom_brennan Hello ?
dr_tom_brennan Hey , Adam , hey , listen can you carve out some time for me on the MRI ?
dr_tom_brennan Yeah , it's a favor for a friend of a friend .
dr_tom_brennan Um , no , that would work out great , okay .
dr_tom_brennan Yeah , thanks , Adam .
dr_tom_brennan His name's Conner .
kate_austen How old is he ?
dr_tom_brennan 22 months next week .
kate_austen He's beautiful .
dr_tom_brennan Yeah , well , it's Rachel , it's not me .
kate_austen Where is she ?
dr_tom_brennan She's over in Cedar Rapids visiting her folks .
dr_tom_brennan They get back on Sunday .
dr_tom_brennan I got Diane in for an MRI .
dr_tom_brennan Now , they'll bring her downstairs to radiology .
dr_tom_brennan The appointment's not til 5am , so , we've got about 3 hours to kill .
kate_austen Tom ...
dr_tom_brennan You're welcome .
kate_austen You think it's still there ?
dr_tom_brennan What ?
kate_austen You know what .
dr_tom_brennan It's the middle of the night , Katie .
kate_austen We might not get another chance .
john_locke What do you think it is ?
john_locke Heatstroke ?
dr_jack_shephard No , he would have felt that coming on .
john_locke Bad fruit maybe ?
john_locke Raw fish ?
dr_jack_shephard Michael and Jin are on the same diet .
john_locke Well , Jin's fine .
dr_jack_shephard Jin's fine .
dr_jack_shephard What was making him sick was metabolized fast .
dr_jack_shephard It hit him quick and it hit him hard .
john_locke So you think it was the water .
dr_jack_shephard No , I don't think it was the water .
dr_jack_shephard I think it was something in the water .
dr_jack_shephard Feeling any better ?
michael_dawson The cramps are quieting down -- as long as I don't move , or , -- or breathe .
michael_dawson You and Locke kiss and make up ?
michael_dawson Good .
dr_jack_shephard No , Michael .
michael_dawson What ?
dr_jack_shephard Drink from that one .
michael_dawson Somebody did this to me ?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know .
dr_jack_shephard I'm not sure of anything yet .
michael_dawson Sawyer .
hugo_reyes I'm on bamboo duty , but
hugo_reyes yeah , sometimes I help refill the water .
john_locke Michael and Jin getting along ?
hugo_reyes Well , they fight like a married couple building a raft together ...
john_locke You told him ?
dr_jack_shephard Think Sawyer might have done it .
hugo_reyes Oh , because of Kate ?
dr_jack_shephard Kate ?
hugo_reyes Yeah , I guess she wants on the raft .
hugo_reyes So Sawyer went off on Michael because , you know , he gets to decide who goes .
hugo_reyes Hey , you don't think Kate did it , do you ?
john_locke Why would Kate poison Michael ?
hugo_reyes Well , you know , the whole fugitive thing .
hugo_reyes He doesn't know ?
hugo_reyes Well how am I supposed to keep straight who knows what around here ?
hugo_reyes I mean , Steve didn't even know about the polar bear .
john_locke What did she do ?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know .
dr_jack_shephard Why don't you ask her ?
john_locke And you didn't think the others should know about this , Jack ?
dr_jack_shephard Discretion , John .
claire_littleton Okay , can you stop moving
claire_littleton or I'm going to cut your ear off .
charlie_pace Ah , this is good .
charlie_pace I'm writing again .
charlie_pace I'm really feeling it , as well .
charlie_pace So , what's the first thing you're going to do when we get rescued ?
claire_littleton You know , I don't really know .

kate_austen Dr . Arzt said if they leave tomorrow ...
dr_jack_shephard Did you poison Michael , Kate ?
kate_austen What ?
dr_jack_shephard He's not sick , someone did this .
kate_austen Do you really think I'm capable of that ?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know what you're capable of .
kate_austen You brought beer ?
dr_tom_brennan No self-respecting man in Iowa goes anywhere without beer .
dr_tom_brennan It's not fair , you know -- you coming back .
dr_tom_brennan Here .
dr_tom_brennan Home .

kate_austen Oh .
dr_tom_brennan Oh my god .
dr_tom_brennan My plane .
dr_tom_brennan I can't believe I let you talk me into putting this in there .
kate_austen That was your idea .
kate_austen Kate and Tom , 1989 .
young_tom Is it on ?
young_tom I don't think it's on .
young_kate It's on .
young_tom Okay , this is Kate Austen and Tom Brennan and this is our dedication for our time capsule , here on August 15th , 1989 .
young_tom Hey , give me that back .
young_kate Why are you putting this stupid plane in there ?
young_tom Because it's cool , Katie .
young_tom I got it when I flew to Dallas by myself .
young_kate Ooh , that is cool , just like this time capsule .
young_tom It'll be totally cool when we dig it up in like 20 years .
young_kate How do you know we'll be together ?
young_tom Because we'll be married and you'll be a mom
young_tom and we'll have 9 kids .
young_kate I don't think so .
young_kate As soon as I get my license we should just get in a car and drive .
young_kate You know , run away .
young_tom You always want to run away , Katie .
young_kate Yeah ,
young_kate and you know why .
dr_tom_brennan Funny how things turn out , huh ?
kate_austen Yeah .
kate_austen Sorry .
dr_tom_brennan We'd better get to the hospital .

walt_lloyd Does it hurt ?
john_locke Yep .
john_locke Something you want to tell me , Walt ?
walt_lloyd I didn't do it .
john_locke Didn't do what ?
walt_lloyd I heard Jack .
walt_lloyd He thinks somebody got my dad sick .
walt_lloyd And I didn't do it .
john_locke You think because I know you burned the first raft that I'd think you made your dad sick ?
john_locke We're friends , Walt .
john_locke I didn't tell on you before
john_locke and I'm not going to tell on you now .
john_locke And I know you would never do anything to hurt your dad .
john_locke What's the matter ?
walt_lloyd Don't open it .
john_locke What'd you say ?
walt_lloyd Don't open it , Mr . Locke .
walt_lloyd Don't open that thing .
john_locke What ?
john_locke What thing ?

james_ford You ain't done with me by a damn sight .
james_ford You said you needed 4 !
michael_dawson I've got 4 !

michael_dawson You're a liar and a criminal , and I'm not letting you near my boy !
james_ford Oh , I'm a criminal , huh? !
james_ford I poisoned you because I'm a criminal !
james_ford Get your hands off me , boy .

james_ford You all remember Joanna , don't you ?
james_ford Huh ?
james_ford The woman who drowned ?
james_ford Now what's Kate doing with poor Joanna's ID ?
james_ford Could it be she'd do just about anything to get on that raft ?
james_ford So she could get herself rescued , run off with a new identity before half the reporters in the world descend on this damn Island ?
james_ford She might even poison the captain himself .
kate_austen Shut up !
james_ford She don't care about nothin' or nobody but herself .

michael_dawson Here .
dr_jack_shephard He looks determined .
sunhwa_kwon Yes , he is .
dr_jack_shephard You don't want him to go , do you ?
sunhwa_kwon No .
dr_jack_shephard Is that why you tried to make him sick ?
dr_jack_shephard Michael and Jin working together all the time -- pretty easy for them to get their water bottles mixed up ...
sunhwa_kwon I didn't want him to die out there .
sunhwa_kwon I just didn't know what to do .
sunhwa_kwon I only used enough to make him -- I wasn't trying to hurt him .
sunhwa_kwon Are you going to tell the others ?
dr_jack_shephard I don't see any reason why they need to know .
dr_jack_shephard But Sun , he's going .
dr_jack_shephard If I were you , I'd -- I'd say goodbye .
james_ford I'm back on the raft .
kate_austen I'm glad to hear it .

james_ford Nah , sorry don't suit me .
james_ford You cornered me , Freckles .
james_ford I did what I had to .
kate_austen I cornered you ?
james_ford You said if you wanted my spot you were going to take it .
james_ford I guess I believed you .
james_ford Well , that's that .
james_ford I've got some packing to do .
kate_austen Why is it so important for you to be on that raft ?

sunhwa_kwon I didn't tell him it was your idea .

sunhwa_kwon You were only trying to help me .
sunhwa_kwon He said he wouldn't tell the others .

danielle_rousseau The Others are coming .
danielle_rousseau Our ship went aground on this Island 16 years ago .
danielle_rousseau There were 6 of us -- my team , 6 .
danielle_rousseau At that time I was already 7 months pregnant .
danielle_rousseau I delivered the infant myself .
danielle_rousseau The baby and I were together for only 1 week when I saw black smoke -- a pillar of black smoke 5 kilometers inland .
danielle_rousseau That night they came , they came and took her --
danielle_rousseau Alex .
danielle_rousseau They took my baby .
danielle_rousseau And now , they're coming again .
danielle_rousseau They're coming for all of you .
dr_jack_shephard Who's coming ?
danielle_rousseau The Others .
danielle_rousseau You have only 3 choices run , hide , or die .
dr_jack_shephard This is a woman who blew up her own shelter .
dr_jack_shephard And now she's talking about seeing black smoke and hearing whispers .
dr_jack_shephard I mean , she's not playing with a full deck .
john_locke That doesn't mean that what she's saying isn't true .
dr_jack_shephard Well , if you want to focus on the " what if, " , be my guest , but I've got to stick with what's tangible .
dr_jack_shephard And right now , that's the launching of the raft .
dr_jack_shephard How's it going ?
michael_dawson I wanted to get off today , but , realistically , man , after we get the rudder done , we've still got to lay the rails to get it down to the water .
jinsoo_kwon Good .
dr_jack_shephard Wouldn't it save time if we were laying the rails while you were finishing the rudder ?
michael_dawson Manpower shortage .
dr_jack_shephard What do you need to lay the rails and then move the boat ?
michael_dawson To get it all done today ?
michael_dawson Pretty much everybody .
dr_jack_shephard Alright , give me 20 minutes .
dr_jack_shephard Grab as many palm tree logs as you can find , the longer the better .
dr_jack_shephard Take them over to the raft area and Michael will know what to do with them .
marshal_edward_mars Okay .
michael_dawson You need to get them in there tight .
michael_dawson You need leverage to get them on the rails .
michael_dawson Good , that's good .
michael_dawson Okay , that's good man .
michael_dawson Just get it under there , okay ?
michael_dawson Okay .
michael_dawson You alright ?
john_locke Yep .
michael_dawson So , listen , on my count
michael_dawson - I'll do 1-2-3-lift and then push , okay ?
michael_dawson Got it ?
michael_dawson Okay , c'mon .
michael_dawson Once we get it down to the water line , we'll drop it and load it up .
michael_dawson Alright .
michael_dawson Ready .
michael_dawson 1-2-3 !
michael_dawson Lift !
michael_dawson Push !
michael_dawson Push , c'mon guys , push , push !
michael_dawson Use the levers , use the levers !
michael_dawson Good , good .
michael_dawson 1-2-3 , lift !
michael_dawson I can't believe this Can't believe it .
james_ford What are you looking at me for? !
james_ford It's not my fault !
michael_dawson You missed a lever !
james_ford Because you couldn't keep the raft going straight !
michael_dawson I couldn't keep the boat going straight ?
michael_dawson Everybody's attention-
walt_lloyd Dad !
walt_lloyd Look .
dr_jack_shephard How many of them are there ?
danielle_rousseau I told you all I know .
sayid_jarrah There has to be more you tell us .
sayid_jarrah How did you know ?
danielle_rousseau You have a bigger problem .
danielle_rousseau I can vanish into the jungle , but I'm just one person .
danielle_rousseau You have 40 people .
danielle_rousseau Where will you hide them ?
hugo_reyes Dude .
hugo_reyes Whoa .
danielle_rousseau What is this ?
dr_jack_shephard We were hoping you could tell us .
danielle_rousseau I have never seen anything like it .
hugo_reyes Uh , question -- how do we know we can all , like , fit in there ?
john_locke No handle on the outside , means there must be another way in .
john_locke Another entrance means space .
sayid_jarrah This is a mistake .
sayid_jarrah We don't know anything about these Others .
sayid_jarrah We're reacting with no information , no intelligence .
sayid_jarrah This hatch might even be theirs .
sayid_jarrah Black smoke on the horizon doesn't mean they're-
danielle_rousseau It means they're coming !
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , we got that .
john_locke You booby-trapped your shelter with explosives .
john_locke You have any more ?
danielle_rousseau Dynamite , at the Black Rock , in the dark territory .
hugo_reyes Well , that's 3 reasons to go right there .
danielle_rousseau If we're to make it back by sunset we have to leave within the hour .
ana_lucia_cortez Tequila and tonic with a wedge of lemon .
ana_lucia_cortez Why were you yelling ?
ana_lucia_cortez --
ana_lucia_cortez The girl , at the check-in counter ?
ana_lucia_cortez You were yelling at her .
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry , uh
dr_jack_shephard , do I know you ?
ana_lucia_cortez I'm on your flight .
ana_lucia_cortez LA ?
ana_lucia_cortez So your dad died , huh ?
dr_jack_shephard I thought you didn't hear what I was yelling about .
ana_lucia_cortez I was being polite .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
dr_jack_shephard My dad died .
ana_lucia_cortez How ?
dr_jack_shephard A heart attack .
ana_lucia_cortez Not a drinker , huh ?
dr_jack_shephard No , no , not really .
ana_lucia_cortez No ring because you're single or because you don't like wearing one ?
dr_jack_shephard You asking me if I'm married ?
ana_lucia_cortez Are you married ?
dr_jack_shephard No .
dr_jack_shephard No , not any more .
dr_jack_shephard Can we get another tequila and tonic , please ?
ana_lucia_cortez I didn't think you were listening .
dr_jack_shephard So , what's your name ?
ana_lucia_cortez Ana Lucia .
dr_jack_shephard So , tell me , Ana Lucia , why are you drinking tequila and tonics at ten to noon ?
ana_lucia_cortez I hate flying .
ana_lucia_cortez And they stuck me all the way in the back of the plane where the wheels come down right under your damn feet .
ana_lucia_cortez So where are you sitting ?
dr_jack_shephard 23B .
ana_lucia_cortez 42F .
ana_lucia_cortez Wanna trade ?
ana_lucia_cortez Hey ,
ana_lucia_cortez yeah .
ana_lucia_cortez I'm in Sydney .
ana_lucia_cortez Hold on .
ana_lucia_cortez Sorry ...
dr_jack_shephard Jack .
ana_lucia_cortez  Jack , I've got to talk .
ana_lucia_cortez We'll have the next drink on the plane , okay ?
dr_jack_shephard 42F .
ana_lucia_cortez 42F
ana_lucia_cortez , right .
ana_lucia_cortez And Jack , the worst part's over .
dr_jack_shephard Look , I know you're all scared .
dr_jack_shephard And I know everybody has a lot of questions .
dr_jack_shephard All I can tell you right now is that we do have a plan .
dr_jack_shephard We've got to go into the jungle to get some supplies .
dr_jack_shephard We'll be back in a few hours .
dr_jack_shephard In the meantime , do everything you can to help Michael get that raft on the water .
dr_jack_shephard And after that , go to the caves .
dr_jack_shephard We'll be back as soon as we can .
dr_jack_shephard I promise .
dr_leslie_arzt Hey , nice speech .
dr_leslie_arzt Plan's a little flawed , but , hey , nobody's perfect .
dr_jack_shephard What plan ?
dr_leslie_arzt Yeah , your plan .
dr_leslie_arzt You're going to go into the jungle and get some dynamite and blow open a hatch
dr_leslie_arzt and then you're going to hide everyone inside .
dr_leslie_arzt You want to keep a secret , don't tell the fat guy .
dr_jack_shephard What do you want , Arzt ?
dr_leslie_arzt God knows how long that dynamite has been out there .
dr_leslie_arzt And from what I can tell , Madam Nutso doesn't seem too concerned with how to handle it .
dr_leslie_arzt So , unless you want to blow up , I'm coming with you .
dr_jack_shephard Okay .
dr_jack_shephard Grab some water bottles .
dr_jack_shephard We're leaving in half an hour .
michael_dawson We can salvage the cable but we need new bamboo for the mast .
michael_dawson We need to fix the rudder before we even start to think about that .
james_ford Need some help ?
michael_dawson Let's just get this done first .
james_ford Hey , this wasn't my fault .
james_ford So put me to work .
michael_dawson No offense , we just work faster this way , okay .
michael_dawson Alright , alright .
michael_dawson What do you think I'm doing over here ?
detective_calderwood You remember me ?
detective_calderwood 3 nights ago ?
detective_calderwood You were hauled in here thrashing and fighting .
detective_calderwood As you were being escorted by you kicked my desk .
detective_calderwood And you broke my mug .
james_ford Nice kids .
detective_calderwood Sadly for you , breaking my mug was not the most significant mistake you made that evening .
james_ford C'mon , Doctor , I got into a bar fight .
james_ford Isn't that a badge of honor in this country ?
detective_calderwood Do you know who you head-butted in that bar ?
detective_calderwood You head-butted the Honorable Warren Truss , Minister of Agriculture , Fisheries , and Forestry .
detective_calderwood One of the most important pe-
james_ford He head-butted me .
detective_calderwood We have witnesses he did no such thing .
james_ford Of course .
detective_calderwood You think this is funny , James ?
detective_calderwood James Ford , assault , wire fraud , identity theft , bank fraud , telemarketing fraud ...
james_ford This going some place ?
detective_calderwood You're a blight , a stain , a scavenger .
detective_calderwood You're a conman who prays on the weak and the needy .
detective_calderwood Tell me something , James , how do you live with yourself ?
james_ford I do just fine .
detective_calderwood Do you ?
detective_calderwood You're not even worth what it would cost us to incarcerate you .
detective_calderwood Which is why you're being deported .
detective_calderwood Your plane leaves this afternoon .
detective_calderwood And , James , you're banned from ever setting foot in Australia again .
james_ford Don't you worry , I ain't ever coming back here .
detective_calderwood Best not , mate .
dr_jack_shephard A lumberjack .
james_ford Excuse me ?
dr_jack_shephard I never asked you what you did back in the real world ,
dr_jack_shephard so , I'm taking a wild guess -- lumberjack .
james_ford Something I can help you with , Doc , because I've got work to do .
dr_jack_shephard I've got something for you .
dr_jack_shephard You're the only one on the raft who knows how to use one .
james_ford What do I need a gun for ?
dr_jack_shephard Just in case .
james_ford You think we're going to run out of food or water ?
james_ford Am I supposed to put the kid out of his misery ?
dr_jack_shephard Just in case .
james_ford What are you doing with the rest of them ?
dr_jack_shephard I'm giving them to Sayid .
james_ford Going into the jungle after the boom sticks , huh ?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
james_ford By the time you get back , we'll be in the water .
james_ford Guess this is pretty much goodbye , then .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , I guess it is .
dr_jack_shephard Good luck , Sawyer .
james_ford Jack .
james_ford -- About a week before we all got on the plane , I got to talking to this man in a bar in Sydney .
james_ford He was American , too .
james_ford A doctor .
james_ford I've been on some benders in my time , but this guy -- he was going for an all time record .
james_ford So , it turns out this guy has a son .
james_ford His son's a doctor , too .
james_ford They had some kind of big time falling out .
james_ford The guy knew it was his fault , even though his son was back in the States thinking the same damn thing .
james_ford See , kids are like dogs , you knock them around enough they'll think they did something to deserve it .
james_ford Anyway , there's a pay phone in this bar .
james_ford And this guy , Christian , tells me he wishes he had the stones to pick up the phone , call his kid ,
james_ford tell him he's sorry , that he's a better doctor than he'll ever be
james_ford -- he's proud , and he loves him .
james_ford I had to take off , but -- something tells me he never got around to making that call .
james_ford Small world , huh ?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
james_ford Good luck , Jack .
australian_official You going to be armed ?
marshal_edward_mars Yes , sir , ankle holster .
australian_official You have to stow this in the crew luggage compartment in the front .
marshal_edward_mars No problemo .
australian_official Why do you need 5 guns ?
marshal_edward_mars Gee , you want to tell him , Kate ?
marshal_edward_mars Why do I need 5 guns ?
marshal_edward_mars She's shy .
australian_official What's this , then ?
marshal_edward_mars That's a good story , you want to tell it , huh , Kate ?
marshal_edward_mars This belonged to her childhood sweetheart who she got killed a couple of years ago when she was on the run .
marshal_edward_mars Poor guy -- a wife , a 2 year old kid .
marshal_edward_mars What was his name ?
marshal_edward_mars Hmm ?
marshal_edward_mars Well , somewhere along the way during the 3 years that I was chasing her , she starts calling me , at my house , and whining on about her mitigating circumstances .
marshal_edward_mars But what she's really doing is taunting me .
marshal_edward_mars So , I tell her that I've got whats-his-name's little toy airplane in a safe deposit box in New Mexico .
marshal_edward_mars So , she somehow figures out which bank , which safe deposit box .
marshal_edward_mars She seduces some idiot to rob the damn bank , and then she puts a bullet in her new friend because she's done using him .
marshal_edward_mars But she leaves all the money .
marshal_edward_mars She just takes the plane because that's the one thing in the whole world that Kate does care about .
marshal_edward_mars She has no attachments , and I think she's telling herself she needs it to atone for killing her boyfriend , whats-his-name .
marshal_edward_mars God , Kate , c'mon , what was his name ?
kate_austen Tom , it's Tom , you son-of-a-bitch !
marshal_edward_mars And that is why I need 5 guns .
kate_austen So , you're heading out ?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
kate_austen I was thinking that I might go with you -- for old time's sake ?
kate_austen I want to help .
dr_jack_shephard You won't be here for the raft launching .
kate_austen Yeah , well , I'm --
kate_austen I'm not very good at goodbyes .
dr_jack_shephard Grab your stuff .
charlie_pace Thanks , man , I'll keep it safe .
charlie_pace Hey , Locke , do you have a message ?
charlie_pace It's going on the raft .
charlie_pace You know " Dear mom , Everything's fine .

dr_leslie_arzt A-R-Z-T , Arzt .
hugo_reyes Sorry , man , the name's hard to pronounce .
dr_leslie_arzt Yeah , well , I know a bunch of 9th graders who pronounce it just fine .
hugo_reyes How about I just call you by your first name ?
dr_leslie_arzt How about you don't ?
hugo_reyes Why not ?
hugo_reyes I remember it from the plane's manifest .
hugo_reyes I think Leslie's a bitchin' name .
dr_leslie_arzt Arnzt is fine .
danielle_rousseau Le Territoire Fonce .
dr_jack_shephard The Dark Territory .
danielle_rousseau The Black Rock is not far .
danielle_rousseau This is where it all began -- where my team got infected , where Montand lost his arm .
danielle_rousseau We must move quickly .
dr_leslie_arzt You know what ?
dr_leslie_arzt I'm going back .
dr_jack_shephard Hey , I thought you wanted to help .
dr_leslie_arzt Yeah , I wanted to help and that was before Montand lost his fricking arm .

john_locke Wait .
john_locke It's headed the other way .
danielle_rousseau We're safe now .
kate_austen What was that thing ?
danielle_rousseau It's a security system .
dr_jack_shephard Security system ?
dr_jack_shephard What does that mean ?
danielle_rousseau Its purpose is that of any security systems -- to protect something .
kate_austen Protect what ?
danielle_rousseau The Island .
hugo_reyes Uh , where's Arnzt ?
dr_leslie_arzt It's Arzt , you idiot .
hugo_reyes Dude , I thought you were dead .
dr_leslie_arzt Can we just , please , go get the dynamite , please ?
walt_lloyd Why are you folding the clothes ?
shannon_rutherford Because I'm anal .
shannon_rutherford Is there something you want ?
walt_lloyd I think you should take Vincent .
shannon_rutherford Are you serious ?
walt_lloyd He'll take care of you .
shannon_rutherford What makes you think I need a dog to take care of me ?
walt_lloyd Vincent took care of me when my mom died -- and nobody would talk to me .
walt_lloyd They pretended like nothing happened .
walt_lloyd So I had to talk to Vincent .
walt_lloyd He's a good listener .
walt_lloyd You could talk to him about Boone if you want .

sayid_jarrah Thank you .
boone_carlyle I couldn't get us into first class .

shannon_rutherford What ?
shannon_rutherford You're on his side , now ?
boone_carlyle One day you're going to appreciate everything I do for you .
shannon_rutherford Yeah , I can't wait for that day .
shannon_rutherford You can try again with the gate agent .
boone_carlyle Would you let it go ?
shannon_rutherford Excuse me for not being pathetic enough to not want to sit next to some crying baby for the next 15 hours .
boone_carlyle Oh god , you can be a bitch .
shannon_rutherford Oh , you want to play ?
shannon_rutherford I will get you thrown off this flight .

boone_carlyle Tell them what ?
boone_carlyle Who's going to believe you ?
boone_carlyle You're not even capable of ...
shannon_rutherford You have no idea what I'm capable of .
shannon_rutherford Excuse me , sir ?

shannon_rutherford Hi , um , some Arab guy just left his bags in the chairs downstairs and then just walked away .
airport_cop Can you describe him , please ?
shannon_rutherford Um , Arab ?
shannon_rutherford He went towards the shops .
shannon_rutherford How's that ?
sayid_jarrah I salvaged a few things for you from the Beechcraft .
sayid_jarrah This is the plane's radar emitter .
sayid_jarrah It needs to be mounted on the mast or the top of the cabin .
james_ford I'll do it .
sayid_jarrah Michael , to conserve power , turn it on only once every hour or so .
sayid_jarrah It will show you any ships within the horizon line , approximately 25 miles .
sayid_jarrah The same with the radio transmitter .
sayid_jarrah This was in the plane's toolbox .
sayid_jarrah There's only one flare .
sayid_jarrah Choose wisely when you use it .
john_locke Why are we stopping ?
danielle_rousseau Because we're here .
danielle_rousseau This is the Black Rock .

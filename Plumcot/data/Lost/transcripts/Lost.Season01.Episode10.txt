claire_littleton What's happening?
john_locke You know what's happening.
claire_littleton But I don't understand. Why --?
john_locke He was your responsibility but you gave him away, Claire. Everyone pays the price now.
charlie_pace It's alright. Hey, hey, you're dreaming. You were sleep-walking, alright? . Claire, what happened?
dr_jack_shephard That must have been a hell of a nightmare.
claire_littleton Who said it was a nightmare?
dr_jack_shephard I'd say when someone makes their fists so tight they dig their fingernails a quarter of an inch into their palm they probably weren't dreaming about riding ponies. Did you ever sleep-walk before?
claire_littleton No. I don't think so. How would I know?
dr_jack_shephard It'll get back to you. I had a girlfriend once that told me I talked in my sleep.
claire_littleton What did you say?
dr_jack_shephard Don't know. Whatever it was she didn't like it. How was your OB-GYN in Sydney?
claire_littleton Good. She was good.
dr_jack_shephard She was okay with letting you fly in your third trimester?
claire_littleton Yeah, I went for a checkup the week before and she said it'd be fine.
dr_jack_shephard Ultrasound was cool?
claire_littleton Uh-huh. Very healthy.
dr_jack_shephard How have you been feeling?
claire_littleton Okay. Back's pretty sore, but it's probably just from sleeping on the ground. I get dizzy if I stand up too fast. And I have to pee all the time.
dr_jack_shephard Are you eating enough?
claire_littleton Boar and bananas.
dr_jack_shephard How many weeks in are you? What was the date that you found out you were pregnant.
thomas Is it pink?
claire_littleton I don't know yet.
thomas I mean, did you actually pee on it?
claire_littleton I don't know, just give me a second.
thomas Maybe you didn't do it right.
claire_littleton Thomas, I can pee on a stick.
thomas Okay, well, what color is it?
claire_littleton How long's it been?
thomas 6 -- 66 seconds. Oh god. . Okay, it's definitely two lines.
claire_littleton Two pink lines?
thomas Pink? No, no, no, these are, like, red.
claire_littleton What? They're pink.
thomas These two lines?
claire_littleton They're pink.
thomas Okay, first of all these tests are not always accurate.
claire_littleton Thomas.
thomas No, no, no, my uncle he thought he had testicular cancer, remember that.
claire_littleton He did. He's dead.
thomas Yeah. I mean, no, no. It was like the wrong -- it was a bad diagnosis. Look, this thing, it doesn't mean for sure that you're pregnant.
claire_littleton Thomas --
thomas We can go get another one.
claire_littleton I am six weeks late, okay. Six weeks. That never happens. I'm pregnant.
thomas Okay. Okay. Look, it's all going to be okay.
claire_littleton I know. I know.
thomas Hey, Claire? If we, if we wanted to we could do this.
claire_littleton Stop it.
thomas No. I'm not kidding.
claire_littleton My mom would disown me.
thomas She basically has already.
claire_littleton Yeah. But with what? My... my five dollar an hour job at Fish and Fry?
thomas You're not the only one with a job, you know. I mean, I've got my painting.
claire_littleton That's sweet, but this isn't what we want.
thomas Maybe it is. This could be like, uh, I don't know. It could be like the best thing ever.
claire_littleton You, you really want to try?
thomas Yeah. Claire, I love you.
dr_jack_shephard Well, this is a first -- you standing still, middle of the day, doing nothing. Amazing.
kate_austen I'm doing something.
dr_jack_shephard Yeah, what's that?
kate_austen I'm sinking. Water goes out, takes the sand with it and you sink. I used to do it with my mom when I was a kid.
dr_jack_shephard Ah, new plan. You're going to just sink your way right off the Island. Sayid would be proud.
kate_austen He's been gone for almost a week.
dr_jack_shephard Something tells me he'll be okay.
kate_austen So what are you doing this far from the caves?
dr_jack_shephard Bringing water down, bringing fish back. Claire's going to have the baby soon.
charlie_pace "Dear diary, still on the bloody Island. Today I swallowed a bug. Love, Claire." Here, what separates us from these savage Yanks if we can't drink tea? Feeling better?
claire_littleton It was just a dream.
charlie_pace Mmmmm. I have this dream... I'm driving a bus and my teeth start falling out. My mom's in the back eating biscuits. Everything smells of bacon. It's weird. Of course, I don't wake up screaming.
claire_littleton I'm alright, Charlie.
charlie_pace No, of course you are. It's just, I think about you in this place -- how hard it must be for you without your family and your friends. And I think we could be friends. I could be your friend. We don't have to do each other's hair or anything. I just mean that if you needed someone to talk to about anything, I'm here.
claire_littleton Charlie.
charlie_pace Okay -- .
claire_littleton I didn't mean that --
charlie_pace It's cool, Claire. It's cool.
claire_littleton Thomas cleaned out his whole loft. I'm officially moving in on Tuesday.
rachel That is great.
claire_littleton I know. He's awesome. . You know, maybe we shouldn't --
rachel No, you're not backing out now.
claire_littleton It's seems --
rachel He's just a psychic, Claire. I mean, I thought you were all into this, all your astrology stuff.
claire_littleton Yeah, I know, but I don't need somebody telling me what's going to happen or how to live my life.
rachel It's not about what you need. It's about what's fun. So unless you have another excuse --
richard_malkin I'll need your hands for this.
richard_malkin Ah, so when did you find out?
claire_littleton What?
richard_malkin About the baby.
claire_littleton Two days ago.
rachel She hasn't told her mom yet. We're afraid she might -- .
claire_littleton What? Should I not tell her? What? What is it?
richard_malkin I'm sorry. I can't, I can't --
claire_littleton What were you gonna -- what did you see?
richard_malkin I'm... I'm not doing this reading.
claire_littleton You, you were going to say something.
richard_malkin You'll have to leave. Now. Thanks, thanks very much.
rachel What a freak.
claire_littleton Help me! Somebody's going to hurt me, please, help me.
charlie_pace Someone attacked her.
dr_jack_shephard What?
claire_littleton He held me down.
michael_dawson Which way did he go? How long ago?
claire_littleton I don't know. I couldn't see. Just now, just now, he just ran away.
hugo_reyes What's going on?
charlie_pace We should find out, check the surrounding caves.
dr_jack_shephard Hey, wait, wait, hold on don't go --
charlie_pace Hurley, let's go.
dr_jack_shephard C'mon, c'mon, let's sit down here, okay? Go get her some water.
dr_ethan_rom Yeah, sure.
dr_jack_shephard Claire, look at me, it's okay. You're safe now.
michael_dawson Did you get a look at him, at all?
claire_littleton No, it was dark. I couldn't see.
dr_jack_shephard Where did this happen?
claire_littleton It was here. I, I was sleeping and I woke up and he was trying to hurt my baby! He had this... this thing -- like... like a needle. And he stabbed me with it. He was trying to hurt my baby.
dr_jack_shephard It's okay. It's okay.
hugo_reyes We looked around the entire perimeter, man.
dr_jack_shephard Nobody saw or heard anything?
hugo_reyes Uh-uh, nada. Everyone was asleep. So, I had an idea. I'm out here looking for some psycho with Scott and Steve, right? And I'm realizing who the hell are Scott and Steve?
dr_jack_shephard I'm not following you?
hugo_reyes Look, if I was a cop and some woman got attacked, we'd canvas, right? Knock on doors, find witnesses. But we don't even have doors.
dr_jack_shephard Hurley, you're not helping me understand where you're...
hugo_reyes Look, we don't know who's living here and who's still at the beach. I mean, we don't even know each other. My name isn't Hurley, it's Hugo Reyes. Hurley's just a nickname I have, alright? Why? I'm not telling. The point is, we've got to find out who everyone is.
dr_jack_shephard You want to start a census.
hugo_reyes Yeah, a registry, you know, names, what people look like, who's related to who. I mean, we start laying down the law, maybe we'll stop attacking each other. It seems like someone's getting punched, or stabbed, or something every other day here. We've got to find out who did this to her.
charlie_pace You alright? Don't worry, you want to close your eyes, I'll be here all night. I won't let anyone get to you. I won't leave you, Claire. Promise.
thomas Wow, we have drapes now.
claire_littleton I know it. I feel all grown up. You like them?
thomas Yeah. They're good.
claire_littleton I don't know why drapes represent age for me. I guess it just feels like something my mum would do. Oh, um, Sasha called, they're going out tonight, wanted to know if we'd go. What? I didn't eat all the chips, there's another bag.
thomas Claire? I can't do this.
claire_littleton Do what? Did you have a bad day?
thomas This isn't working. Come on, you knew that.
claire_littleton I what? Um, just so I'm not over-reacting here, are you breaking up with me?
thomas Look, for the past three months, it's just, you know, there's always some plan, some responsibility, somewhere that we have to be, someone that you have to talk to.
claire_littleton Well, yeah, I'm trying to make sure that when the baby comes...
thomas Oh, the baby, yeah, I mean, that is just not -- it's like this now, you know. What's it going to be like when the baby comes?
claire_littleton But you said we should do this.
thomas Yeah, well, now it's real.
claire_littleton Well, you can't just change your mind.
thomas How in the hell am I supposed to be a dad, Claire? How about my painting, my life?
claire_littleton I knew... I knew this was going to happen.
thomas I told you so -- terrific. Now I get all your daddy abandonment crap, huh?
claire_littleton Hey, you bastard, don't you dare try and justify what you're doing!
thomas I have done nothing, okay. I have done absolutely nothing.
claire_littleton What?! I have?!
thomas You don't think I've seen what you've done?
claire_littleton Excuse me?
thomas You were supposed to be on the pill.
claire_littleton You think I got pregnant on purpose?
thomas I don't even care.
claire_littleton Like this was some kind of plan? You are out of your mind!
thomas It's over, Claire.
claire_littleton No, it's not over!
thomas I'm outta here.
claire_littleton Thomas!
hugo_reyes John, right? John Locke?
john_locke Is this about your census?
hugo_reyes Yeah, you know, I thought it'd be a good idea, you know, to get everyone's name and place of residence.
john_locke And who's checking on you?
hugo_reyes Uh, me?
john_locke That was a joke.
hugo_reyes Uh, good one.
john_locke Yep. You already know my name. I lived most of my life in Tustin, CA.
hugo_reyes Cool. And, reason for travel? The reason you were in Australia?
john_locke I was looking for something.
hugo_reyes Looking, uh-huh. So, did you find it?
john_locke No. It found me. Anything else?
hugo_reyes No, no. That's good. Uh, thanks.
hugo_reyes Hey, uh, I know I already talked to you, but, uh, I just wanted to get away from him fast, okay?
charlie_pace Did you see anyone leave the beach last night?
kate_austen People come and go, but I, I don't know. . What?
dr_jack_shephard I'm not sure anything actually happened.
charlie_pace Wait, what?
dr_jack_shephard Claire told Michael and I that this attacker tried to inject her with something. But there was no mark on her stomach. She wakes up two nights in a row screaming. The first time she was sleep-walking.
charlie_pace You think she was making this up? She was terrified, man.
dr_jack_shephard Look, she said that the guy was trying to hurt her baby. Why would someone do that now with all of us sleeping 20 feet away?
charlie_pace So, you think she's lying?
dr_jack_shephard No. Pregnant women have extremely lucid...
charlie_pace Lucid, right.
dr_jack_shephard These are textbook anxiety nightmares.
charlie_pace You know everything that's going on with everyone?
kate_austen Hey. So what do we do?
dr_jack_shephard She's due in a little more than a week, maybe two, but if she stays stressed out like this, or has another panic attack it could trigger an early labor. And out here, with no instruments, no monitors, no anesthetic -- that would not be good.
charlie_pace It's not all in her head.
hugo_reyes Hey, Lance.
dr_ethan_rom Sorry?
hugo_reyes Lance. Your name's Lance, right?
dr_ethan_rom Ethan.
hugo_reyes Dude, that's right. Lance is the little skinny guy with the glasses and the red hair.
dr_ethan_rom I can see how you'd confuse us.
hugo_reyes Sorry, dude. Lots of names and faces. It's pretty pathetic, huh? You'd think after a couple of weeks on the Island with the same people, we'd all know each other.
dr_ethan_rom Yeah, you're right. You would think so.
hugo_reyes So, we're doing this list, you know, survivors, names, home addresses, stuff like that.
dr_ethan_rom Okay, well, you already have my name...
hugo_reyes Not Lance.
dr_ethan_rom Definitely not.
hugo_reyes Last name?
dr_ethan_rom Rom.
hugo_reyes Rom, R-O-M?
dr_ethan_rom That's right?
hugo_reyes Great, where are you from Ethan Rom?
dr_ethan_rom Ontario.
hugo_reyes Right on, love Canada, great uh... well that should do it. Thanks for your time, dude.
dr_ethan_rom Hey, what's this for?
hugo_reyes Oh, it's nothing. It's just, uh, you know, I thought I'd be a good idea.
dr_jack_shephard Claire?
claire_littleton Did you find him?
dr_jack_shephard Um, no.
claire_littleton Well, what if he comes back?
dr_jack_shephard Claire, this situation we're in -- the crash, that no one's coming, this place -- it, it can kind of mess with your head a little, and maybe make you see things that aren't actually there. Now, I know it feels very real.
claire_littleton I, I don't understand...
dr_jack_shephard Your baby's coming, soon. And I can't even imagine how scary that must be for you, but the more upset you are, the more dangerous it is for you, and your baby. So, I want you to take these.
claire_littleton What are they?
dr_jack_shephard It's a sedative, very mild -- commonly used in situations like yours. It won't harm the baby, I promise.
claire_littleton You don't believe me.
dr_jack_shephard Claire.
claire_littleton You think I'm making this up? I get attacked and you want to give me sleeping pills?
dr_jack_shephard They're not sleeping p -- look, it's a very mild sedative.
claire_littleton I'm leaving.
dr_jack_shephard What? No. Claire, Claire.
claire_littleton I was safer at the beach. It's not safe here.
dr_jack_shephard Don't do this, Claire. You need to think about the baby.
claire_littleton Don't talk to me about the baby. I'm sick of everyone telling me what to do.
dr_jack_shephard Please.
claire_littleton Let go of me.
charlie_pace You okay? What did you say to her?
richard_malkin Yes?
claire_littleton Mr. Malkin, we met before.
richard_malkin Yes. I remember.
claire_littleton You wouldn't give me a reading. I was hoping you would now.
claire_littleton If you're psychic, why do you have to count it?
richard_malkin That's not how it works.
claire_littleton I was just joking.
claire_littleton So, how does it work?
richard_malkin I don't know. Oh, when did he leave you?
claire_littleton Last week. Is that why you didn't want to do my reading last time?
richard_malkin No, no. I saw something, sort of a blurry thing.
claire_littleton And, blurry's bad?
richard_malkin Blurry's bad. That's why I stopped the reading. Are you sure you want to go on now?
claire_littleton Yeah, yes, please.
richard_malkin I can tell you, this is important.
claire_littleton Okay.
richard_malkin It is crucial that you yourself raise this child.
claire_littleton You mean with Thomas? Is he...
richard_malkin The father of this child will play no part in it's life, nor yours.
claire_littleton So what exactly are you saying?
richard_malkin This child parented by anyone else, anyone other than you -- danger surrounds this baby...
claire_littleton Danger?
richard_malkin Your nature, your spirit, your goodness, must be an influence in the development of this child.
claire_littleton Look, if Thomas and I don't get back together I'm putting this baby up for adoption. I just wanted to find out what would give the baby the happiest life.
richard_malkin There is no happy life -- not for this child, not without you.
claire_littleton I don't...
richard_malkin It can't be another. You mustn't allow another to raise your baby.
claire_littleton Okay, great. Thanks for taking my 200.
richard_malkin Oh, no look, take it. Ms. Littleton, I am begging you just to consider...
claire_littleton I can't raise this child by myself.
richard_malkin You have to listen to me!
claire_littleton Okay, thanks for your time, and my money back.
richard_malkin Ms. Littleton, please. The baby needs your protection! Ms. Littleton, please!
claire_littleton Hello?
richard_malkin Ms. Littleton, it's Richard Malkin.
claire_littleton Oh, my God.
richard_malkin Listen to me. I have a plan, something that will make this all better.
claire_littleton You've got to stop calling me. It's too late, alright. I'm going to see adoptive services tomorrow.
richard_malkin I've been telling you for months, you cannot do that.
claire_littleton Look, what I do with my baby is none of your business.
richard_malkin If you don't do what I'm suggesting, great danger will befall...
claire_littleton Hey, great danger will befall you if you don't stop calling me in the middle of the night.
richard_malkin I know what you're feeling inside, Claire -- that you're doubting your decision to give up the baby. Look, I'm begging you, don't do it. At least hear my plan first.
claire_littleton Good night.
charlie_pace Hi. Where are you going?
claire_littleton Back to the beach.
charlie_pace What happened? Did Jack...
claire_littleton Jack tried to dope me. He thinks I'm making all this up, that none of it really happened.
charlie_pace Right. So, to prove your sanity you go tromping through the jungle alone. Well done.
claire_littleton I'm not crazy, Charlie.
shannon_rutherford You want my information. Name Shannon Rutherford, Age 20, Address Craphole Island.
hugo_reyes So, uh, where were you guys last night?
shannon_rutherford Um, the beach.
boone_carlyle Why the interrogation?
hugo_reyes You're like the 20th person to ask me that. Why is everyone so uptight about answering a few questions?
boone_carlyle Well, maybe we're just not cool with you setting up your own little Patriot Act, man.
shannon_rutherford He's a liberal.
boone_carlyle No, seriously, why the list?
hugo_reyes Ah, it's nothing, we just had a little incident in the valley last night.
shannon_rutherford An incident?
hugo_reyes Yeah, Claire, the pregnant girl, you know her, she, uh, kind of got attacked.
shannon_rutherford What?
boone_carlyle She okay?
hugo_reyes Yeah, she's a little shook up, but...
shannon_rutherford I am so not moving to the rape caves.
boone_carlyle You know, your life would be so much easier if you just had the manifest as we crossed out all the names of the dead after we burned the fuselage, so it should be a full roster of the rest of us.
hugo_reyes What? Really? Where is it?
boone_carlyle Who do you think?
hugo_reyes I'm just going to lay it out straight.
james_ford Okay, you do that.
hugo_reyes I hear you have the flight manifest, and I need it, and I want you to give it to me.
james_ford That so?
hugo_reyes Now, you could do what you normally do when someone asks for something -- tell me to screw off.
james_ford Screw off?
hugo_reyes Or, you could just give it to me -- because, dude, you could use the points.
james_ford Well, gosh, you sure know how to butter a man up, Stay Puft.
hugo_reyes It's a gift.
james_ford Manifest is in the brown suitcase. Take it.
charlie_pace Please let me carry your bag.
claire_littleton I'm fine.
charlie_pace I know you're fine, but I can still carry your bag.
claire_littleton Why did you come after me?
charlie_pace Well, it's probably because I like you. What?
claire_littleton You don't like me, Charlie, okay? You just want to rescue me because, because of this . I'm fine, okay. I don't need rescuing. I don't need...
charlie_pace Whoa, Claire. What is it? What, Claire, what, what is it?
charlie_pace Is that another one?
claire_littleton Yeah.
charlie_pace Okay, we need to time the contractions. That's what you do, time the contractions, okay. One sugar-plum fairy, two sugar-plum fairy...
claire_littleton Charlie.
charlie_pace You just need to calm down, alright. Big deep breaths. . Oh, bloody hell.
claire_littleton Charlie, I need you to go get Jack.
charlie_pace What?
claire_littleton I'll be alright.
charlie_pace I'm not leaving you alone.
claire_littleton Charlie, please just go.
charlie_pace I can deliver a baby. I can do this. This must happen all the time.
claire_littleton Charlie, you don't know how to deliver a...
charlie_pace Just listen to me. I'm not going to let anything happen to you. I might not know what I'm doing but I'll figure it out. If I can kick drugs I can deliver a baby. Let me explain. I'm a drug addict. I was a drug addict. I'm clean now.
claire_littleton Get Jack!
charlie_pace Right.
lawyer Arlene and Joseph will bring you to Melbourne. They'll pay your living and medical expenses.
arlene We found you an apartment. It's a really nice two bedroom place. And, well, we think you're going to be really comfortable in it.
lawyer As discussed, once the baby is born and handed over to the Stewarts you'll have no right to see the child again. You'll have no right to correspond with the child. It will be entirely up to Eileen and Joseph to decide whether to tell the child anything about you. Understood?
claire_littleton Yes.
lawyer Upon your discharge from the hospital you'll be given an additional payment of 20,000 dollars.
claire_littleton I just want to make sure that you're going to take really good care of the baby.
arlene Of course we will.
lawyer Now, I'll need you to sign and date here, where indicated.
claire_littleton Do you know "Catch a Falling Star"? It's a song, like a lullaby.
arlene "Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket."
claire_littleton My dad used to sing that to me when I was little. Do you think you could sing it to the baby once in a while?
arlene Of course.
claire_littleton It's not working.
lawyer Here.
claire_littleton I, I'm sorry. I can't do this.
arlene What? No!
claire_littleton Okay, what is it? What's your offer.
charlie_pace Oh, thank god. What's your name?
dr_ethan_rom Ethan.
charlie_pace Ethan...
dr_ethan_rom Are you alright?
charlie_pace ...you need to go the caves. Run to caves. Get Jack. Tell him that Claire...
dr_ethan_rom Claire. Is she okay?
charlie_pace She's having the baby. Go fast, okay? I'll be with her, on the path over there. Go.
charlie_pace Claire?
claire_littleton I'm here.
charlie_pace Claire. Okay, Jack's coming. How are you doing?
claire_littleton It hurts.
charlie_pace Okay, just take my hand. Squeeze. Okay, breathe. Inhale, exhale. Good, just breathe. Inhale, okay, good.
claire_littleton I'm not supposed to be here.
charlie_pace I think we all feel like that a little bit.
claire_littleton I know, it's just -- someone promised me it would be different.
charlie_pace Well, he was wrong.
claire_littleton Yeah. He was wrong.
claire_littleton You spent the last 4 months telling me I have to raise the baby myself. Now you're giving me money and saying I don't have to?
richard_malkin I found a couple in Los Angeles who are very eager to adopt. The baby will be safe in their care. Now, I've foreseen...
claire_littleton Heh, Foreseen? I don't even know why I'm here. I'm sorry.
richard_malkin I know this sounds ridiculous, Claire. All this psychic business, and I appreciate that you must think I'm a raving madman. But this is what must happen.
claire_littleton So, you're giving me 6000 dollars to give my baby to a couple of strangers in Los Angeles?
richard_malkin 12,000. The other 6 when you arrive in Los Angeles. And they're not strangers, Claire. They're good people.
charlie_pace A psychic?
claire_littleton I know. It's embarrassing. And now after everything, he was just full of it.
charlie_pace Or not. I mean, all he wanted was that no one else raise your baby, right? Maybe he knew. I mean, if he wanted it bad enough. You know, if he had the gift, and I believe some people do, maybe he knew, Claire.
claire_littleton I can't go tomorrow. I have to get my...
richard_malkin It has to be this flight. It can't be any other. They're already scheduled to meet you when you arrive. Flight 815. Flight 815.
claire_littleton There was no couple in Los Angeles. He knew. He knew about the plane, what was going to happen. Oh my god, he knew.
charlie_pace You feel another one coming?
claire_littleton I don't think so.
charlie_pace Where the hell is Jack?
claire_littleton You know, I think, I think I'm alright.
charlie_pace The contractions?
claire_littleton Maybe that was the last one? Please let that be the last one.
charlie_pace Jack said that stress can cause false labor. You sure you're alright?
claire_littleton No pain.
charlie_pace Birthing emergency averted. I told you I'd take care of you.
claire_littleton Thanks, Charlie.
charlie_pace You're quite welcome. You think you can make it back to the caves? I won't let anything happen to you.
claire_littleton Okay, let's go.
dr_jack_shephard Sayid?
sayid_jarrah Listen to me. I found her, the French woman.
dr_jack_shephard I need some water. What happened?
sayid_jarrah The woman -- on the island. I had to come back. I had to come back. We're not alone.
charlie_pace You okay?
claire_littleton Yeah, yeah. Look, he just kicked, here .
hugo_reyes We've got a problem. The manifest, Jack, the census, the names of everyone who survived, all 46 of us. I interviewed everyone. Here, at the beach, got their names. One them, one of them isn't -- Jack! One of them isn't in the manifest. He wasn't on the plane.
dr_ethan_rom Hello there.
charlie_pace Ethan, where's Jack?

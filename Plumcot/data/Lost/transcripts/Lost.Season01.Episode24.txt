charlie_pace Claire , everybody's leaving .

claire_littleton I've got the baby , and I'm so tired
claire_littleton , I can't carry him -- now he's wet , there's sand everywhere , I don't have anymore nappies .
charlie_pace Why don't you let me help .
claire_littleton No , nobody ever taught me how to do this , okay ?
charlie_pace Claire , it's going to be okay .
claire_littleton Oh , why do people keep telling me that ?
claire_littleton Are they the ones with the baby ?
sayid_jarrah We've got to get there before sundown .
sayid_jarrah Once you reach the caves , stay there .
sayid_jarrah The rest of us will be right behind you .
charlie_pace Sayid .
charlie_pace I need a gun .
charlie_pace Look , I know Jack gave them to you .
charlie_pace I want one right now .
charlie_pace I have to protect Claire .
sayid_jarrah Rousseau said the Others wouldn't be here until nightfall .
charlie_pace Rousseau is certifiable .
charlie_pace What if they show up before then and-
sayid_jarrah The last time you handled a sidearm-
charlie_pace I killed a murderer .
charlie_pace I did us all a favor .
sayid_jarrah Charlie , you're emotionally involved .
sayid_jarrah Let me handle the weapons .
charlie_pace But you're not here all the time .
charlie_pace You can't protect Claire .
charlie_pace Look , I need a gun !
sayid_jarrah If you really want to help Claire , get her packed , carry her child to the caves .
sayid_jarrah That's what she needs .
hugo_reyes How exactly does something like this happen ?
danielle_rousseau Are you on the same Island as I am ?
hugo_reyes I guess that explains it .
dr_leslie_arzt Hold on , wait , hold on .
dr_leslie_arzt Hold , wait .
dr_leslie_arzt What are we a couple miles inland ?
dr_leslie_arzt A tsunami probably swept it here , huh
dr_leslie_arzt , right ?
dr_jack_shephard Hey , hey , where are you going ?
danielle_rousseau Explosives are in the hold of the ship .
dr_jack_shephard Rousseau , wait .
danielle_rousseau I did what you asked .
danielle_rousseau You need dynamite , you don't need me .
john_locke Let her go , Jack .
dr_jack_shephard Who's going to lead us back ?
john_locke I'll lead us back .
dr_jack_shephard Damn it .
dr_jack_shephard You heard her -- the explosives are in the hold .
dr_jack_shephard Let's go .
dr_leslie_arzt Whoa , whoa , hold on , hold on .
dr_leslie_arzt I came here to tell you how to handle dynamite , not explore some ghost ship
dr_leslie_arzt , you think I'm go-
dr_jack_shephard Alright , just stay out here .
hugo_reyes Uh , I'm going to stay out here and hang with Arnzt .
john_locke Slaves .
john_locke This ship must have been in route to a mining colony -- probably set off from the eastern coast of Africa -- Mozambique .
kate_austen Jack , John , over here .
dr_leslie_arzt And then my 3rd wife , she says , get this , she says , " I didn't sign up for this .
dr_leslie_arzt "
dr_leslie_arzt Now you tell me , what the hell is that even supposed to mean ?
dr_leslie_arzt What , am -- am I boring you ?
hugo_reyes Huh ?
dr_leslie_arzt You know what ?
dr_leslie_arzt I'm --
dr_leslie_arzt I'm sorry ,
dr_leslie_arzt I'm so ...
dr_leslie_arzt I'm sorry that I'm not cool enough to be part of your merry little band of adventurers .
hugo_reyes What ?
dr_leslie_arzt I know a clique when I see it .
dr_leslie_arzt I teach high school , pal-y .
dr_leslie_arzt You know , you people think you're the only ones on this Island doing anything of value .
dr_leslie_arzt I've got news for you .
dr_leslie_arzt There were 40 other survivors of this plane crash .
dr_leslie_arzt And we are all people , too .
hugo_reyes O-kay .
kate_austen You know what ?
kate_austen We could probably get it open if I just-
dr_jack_shephard No , no , no , we should take it outside .
kate_austen Why ?
kate_austen We don't even know if it's ...
dr_jack_shephard You're not prying open a crate that says explosives on the side with a pick axe , Kate .
john_locke Yeah , I agree with Jack -- take it outside , open it there .
kate_austen Okay .
dr_jack_shephard I got it .
dr_jack_shephard You mind showing us the way ?
dr_leslie_arzt And it's not just the teenagers , either .
dr_leslie_arzt You know , the gym teachers -- you think they let me sit with them in the cafeteria ?
dr_leslie_arzt No .
dr_leslie_arzt They do not .
hugo_reyes Dude , this is all in your head .
dr_leslie_arzt Really ?
dr_leslie_arzt Then you explain to me why Kate gets the best pieces of wreckage to build her shelter ?
dr_leslie_arzt And the Korean guy ?
dr_leslie_arzt Does he catch fish for everybody on the Island ?
dr_leslie_arzt No , he does not .
dr_leslie_arzt He doesn't .
dr_leslie_arzt And some of us have actually lost weight while we were here .
dr_leslie_arzt Now , would mind telling me where you're hiding the carbs because I can't figure ...
dr_leslie_arzt What the hell are you people doing? !
dr_leslie_arzt Wait , wait , stop , stop , right where you are .
dr_leslie_arzt Alright , I want you to put that down carefully .
dr_leslie_arzt Put it down carefully .
dr_leslie_arzt Put it gently , gently .
dr_leslie_arzt Damn it , carefully , gently , gently .
dr_leslie_arzt Alright , now get out of there .
dr_leslie_arzt Come away from there .
dr_leslie_arzt C'mon , get out .
dr_leslie_arzt Move away from it .
dr_jack_shephard What the hell are you doing ?
dr_leslie_arzt Shhh .
dr_leslie_arzt Be quiet .
dr_leslie_arzt Do any of you have any idea what happens to dynamite in 90+ degree heat , huh ?
dr_leslie_arzt So you know ?
dr_leslie_arzt Any of you ?
dr_leslie_arzt It sweats nitroglycerin .
dr_leslie_arzt Whoa , hey , what you doing ?
dr_leslie_arzt Did I ask you to come closer ?
dr_leslie_arzt Dynamite is nitroglycerin stabilized by clay .
dr_leslie_arzt Nitroglycerin is the most dangerous and unstable explosive known to man .
dr_leslie_arzt Hey , Kate give me your shirt .
dr_leslie_arzt Now , princess , give me your shirt .
dr_leslie_arzt I need to wrap the dynamite .
dr_leslie_arzt Just throw it to me , right here .
dr_leslie_arzt Be careful , c'mon , hurry up .
dr_leslie_arzt Okay , good , now back up , back up , back up .
dr_leslie_arzt Just back up .
dr_leslie_arzt Get out of my way .
dr_leslie_arzt Any of you ever hear about the guy who invented nitroglycerin ?
dr_leslie_arzt Probably not -- because he blew his freaking face off .
dr_leslie_arzt His lab assistant came into the room , saw that his mentor detonated , and he said , " Huh , I guess this stuff does work . "
dr_leslie_arzt Alright , we're not going to take any more of this stuff than we need because nitroglycerin is extremely temperamental , so we-
hugo_reyes Dude .
airport_cop Sorry for the inconvenience .
sayid_jarrah I'm sure you are .
airport_cop Sir , your bag was unattended .
sayid_jarrah Am I free to go ?
airport_cop Yes , sir .

hawaiian_shirt Sorry .

michael_dawson I'm happy to say goodbye to this place forever .
walt_lloyd What about everybody else ?
walt_lloyd Think they'll be okay ?
michael_dawson I hope so , buddy .
michael_dawson At least until we can get them some help .
james_ford Redemption song is all I'll ever have ...
michael_dawson You singing Bob Marley ?

james_ford Why , you like Bob Marley ?
michael_dawson Man , who doesn't like Bob Marley ?

hugo_reyes An accident ,
hugo_reyes yeah .
dr_jack_shephard Locke , we should think about this .
john_locke Alright .
dr_jack_shephard Maybe this isn't the best way .
john_locke It's the only way , Jack .
dr_jack_shephard How many do we need to blow the Hatch ?
john_locke Two should take care of the hinge , three to be safe .
dr_jack_shephard Safe ?
john_locke I'm removing the driest pieces to minimize our risk transporting it .
john_locke You ever play " Operation " ?

claire_littleton She took my baby !
charlie_pace This is your fault !
charlie_pace You brought her into the camp !
charlie_pace If you had just given me a gun !
sayid_jarrah Do not hit me again .
sayid_jarrah You want to waste time assigning blame ?
sayid_jarrah There's plenty to go around .
sayid_jarrah She has a head start .
sayid_jarrah If we leave now we can catch her .
charlie_pace How are we going to do that? !
sayid_jarrah Because I know where she's going .
claire_littleton I want my baby !
dr_jack_shephard We can carry all the sticks in my pack .
dr_jack_shephard The more insulation we stuff in the better .
john_locke I think we should split them up .
dr_jack_shephard What ?
john_locke It's not smart to keep it all together .
john_locke So , we split them up .
john_locke If we need 3 sticks to blow the hinge then we should bring 6 -- 3 and 3 -- failsafe , in case one of us ...
dr_jack_shephard You and me , then .
kate_austen No , I'm --
kate_austen I'm taking one .
dr_jack_shephard It's not going to happen , no .
kate_austen This is why I came .
dr_jack_shephard Then , you wasted a trip .

dr_jack_shephard Kate , no one owes anyone anything .
kate_austen I'm carrying one .
dr_jack_shephard We're done here .
kate_austen This is not your decision .
dr_jack_shephard Kate , yes it is .
john_locke We'll draw straws .
john_locke They're coming .
john_locke We don't have time to argue about who gets to risk their life , so -- we'll let fate decide .
kate_austen Works for me .
dr_jack_shephard What about you ?
dr_jack_shephard You want to carry some dynamite , too ?
dr_jack_shephard What ?
hugo_reyes You got some ...
hugo_reyes Arnzt on you .
john_locke Short sticks carry the packs .
john_locke Looks like it's me and you , Kate .
walt_lloyd So , what's this stuff even do ?
michael_dawson Well , the transmitter sends out an SOS in case someone's listening .
michael_dawson And if there's anything out there , we'll see it on this radar screen here .
michael_dawson Here we go .
michael_dawson C'mon , someone find us .
walt_lloyd Those are the messages everybody wrote .
james_ford Sure are .
walt_lloyd They're private .
james_ford Yep .
james_ford I , for one , never knew how much Tracy missed her hubby and 2 kids back in Fresno .
james_ford Yet she's sleeping next to good old Scott to keep her warm at night .
walt_lloyd That's Steve .
walt_lloyd Scott's dead .
james_ford Whatever .
james_ford It's alright
james_ford , Kazoo , we've got to keep ourselves entertained .
james_ford Who the hell is Hugo and how's he got a 160 million dollars to leave to his mom .
walt_lloyd How would you like it if I read yours ?
james_ford You can't read mine because I didn't write one .
walt_lloyd Why not ?
james_ford Because the only one I ever wrote is to the man I'm going to kill .
walt_lloyd Why you going to kill him ?
james_ford Because I need to .
walt_lloyd Why ?
james_ford Because !
charlie_pace Are you bloody joking? !
charlie_pace Why would she go for the black smoke? !
charlie_pace Isn't that where the Others are supposed to be? !
sayid_jarrah The Others are precisely why she would go there .
sayid_jarrah Rousseau told us she saw black smoke the day her own child was taken 16 years ago .
sayid_jarrah They took something from her , and now she believes she has something that they want .
charlie_pace She's making a trade ?
sayid_jarrah I believe she is , yes .
charlie_pace That's insane .
charlie_pace She's insane .
sayid_jarrah Don't try to apply reason to her actions .
sayid_jarrah She's a mother who lost her child , just like Claire .
sayid_jarrah This isn't about revenge .
sayid_jarrah Don't make it personal .
claire_littleton I'm coming with you .
sayid_jarrah That's not a good idea , Claire .
claire_littleton This is my baby , okay? !
claire_littleton I let her take him !
charlie_pace Hey , hey .
claire_littleton Don't tell me what to do , okay !
charlie_pace Calm down !
claire_littleton I am going to come with you !
claire_littleton This is my fault
claire_littleton and I'm coming
claire_littleton and you can't stop me !
charlie_pace It's alright , Claire .
claire_littleton Get him back , Charlie .
claire_littleton Get Aaron back .
charlie_pace Aaron ?
claire_littleton Please , get him back .
charlie_pace Claire , I will get him back .
charlie_pace Promise .
michael_dawson Hey , you want something to eat ?
michael_dawson I guess that's a no , then .
michael_dawson If you're worried about Vincent , he going to be okay , man .
michael_dawson Dogs fly in the luggage compartment all the time .
michael_dawson --
michael_dawson Alright , I've got to call work , right over there .
michael_dawson Don't go anywhere , okay ?
michael_dawson No , I live in a studio apartment .
michael_dawson I've got to be out the door in the morning for work by 5am .
michael_dawson Who's going to watch him ?
michael_dawson How's he going to get to school ?
michael_dawson What's he going to do after school ?
michael_dawson I can't do this , ma .
michael_dawson -- You know , I was -- listen , I was thinking -- I was thinking maybe you could take him .
michael_dawson --
michael_dawson Look , ma , if it's a question of money , I ...
michael_dawson What am I supposed to do with him? !
michael_dawson He's not supposed to be mine !
michael_dawson He was never part of the plan .
michael_dawson Yeah , I -- thanks a lot .
michael_dawson Hey , man , I was , uh ...
walt_lloyd I need new batteries .
michael_dawson Hey , want to try ?
walt_lloyd What ?
michael_dawson C'mon , come here .
michael_dawson You drive for a while .
walt_lloyd Really ?
michael_dawson Absolutely .
michael_dawson Okay now , look , the most important part of this boat is the rudder .
michael_dawson It's how you steer .
michael_dawson You turn it gradually --
michael_dawson nothing sharp , okay .
michael_dawson Push it this way .
walt_lloyd Where are we going ?
michael_dawson Look , so , we're going approximately North by Northeast .
michael_dawson So , hopefully that puts us into a shipping lane , or we hit some land .
walt_lloyd What do I aim for ?
michael_dawson See that cloud on the horizon , right there ?
walt_lloyd Yeah .
michael_dawson You aim for that .
walt_lloyd Yep .
michael_dawson Okay .
walt_lloyd Got it .
walt_lloyd -- How come you and my mom didn't stay together ?
michael_dawson We tried .
michael_dawson It just didn't work out , so -- our lives , our interests -- we just went in different directions .
walt_lloyd How come I never saw you ?
michael_dawson Because your Mom didn't want me to .
michael_dawson She did what she thought was best for you .
walt_lloyd She was wrong .
jinsoo_kwon Rudder !
michael_dawson Hey , we hit a log !
michael_dawson We lost the rudder .
jinsoo_kwon Rudder !

michael_dawson C'mon , buddy .
michael_dawson You just saved our asses , buddy .
michael_dawson Here's your shirt .
michael_dawson You should put that back on before you burn .
kate_austen Sorry .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , well , luck of the draw .
john_locke The sun sets in 90 minutes , give or take .
john_locke If we want to get back to the Hatch we're going to have to hustle .
dr_jack_shephard Okay , this is how we do this .
dr_jack_shephard I'll lead -- Kate
dr_jack_shephard , you're right behind me , then Hurley .
dr_jack_shephard John , you bring up the rear .
dr_jack_shephard If you start to see me heading the wrong way-
john_locke We should stagger our formation -- keep a safe distance from each other .
dr_jack_shephard Alright , we stagger .
dr_jack_shephard If anyone hears anything or sees anything ...
hugo_reyes Like the security system that eats people ?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , like that .
dr_jack_shephard You two , you take your packs off , you put them down and you run .
dr_jack_shephard You got it ?
kate_austen Got it .

sunhwa_kwon Do you think all this
sunhwa_kwon -- all we've been through -- do you think we're being punished ?
shannon_rutherford Punished for what ?
sunhwa_kwon Things we did before -- the secrets we kept , the lies we told .
shannon_rutherford Who do you think is punishing us ?
sunhwa_kwon Fate .
claire_littleton No one's punishing us .
claire_littleton There's no such thing as fate .
sayid_jarrah Are you okay ?

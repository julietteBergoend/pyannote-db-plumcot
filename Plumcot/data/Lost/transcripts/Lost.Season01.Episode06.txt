kate_austen It's not like I'm asking a personal question .
dr_jack_shephard It is a personal question .
kate_austen You don't have to get all quiet on me .
kate_austen I just want to know .
dr_jack_shephard Well , you're not going to know .
kate_austen What's the big deal ?
dr_jack_shephard It's not a big deal .
dr_jack_shephard It's just something I did .
dr_jack_shephard I had my reasons .
dr_jack_shephard And I don't want to put it out there .
kate_austen It's just that you and your tattoos don't add up .
kate_austen Are you one of those hard-core spinal surgeons ?
dr_jack_shephard That's me .
dr_jack_shephard Hard-core .
charlie_pace If you guys are finished verbally copulating we should get a move on .
charlie_pace There's a whole beach of people waiting for us to get some drinking water for them .
charlie_pace And the great white hunter's getting restless .
dr_jack_shephard Okay , let's do this .
kate_austen Hey , Charlie .
kate_austen Ask Jack about his tattoos .
charlie_pace Oh , you guys have an inside joke .
charlie_pace How absolutely wonderful for you both .
jinsoo_kwon Miss .

sayid_jarrah What happened ?
dr_jack_shephard Water's this way .
kate_austen How'd you find this place ?
dr_jack_shephard Luck .
dr_jack_shephard This is it .
john_locke It's amazing .
charlie_pace Absolutely .
charlie_pace It's totally you .
charlie_pace Hey guys , shouldn't someone look through this stuff ?
charlie_pace Could be something useful in here .
john_locke He's got a point .
charlie_pace I do ?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
dr_jack_shephard Bring me your bottles , and keep an eye out for any medical supplies , drugs in particular .
charlie_pace Drugs , right .
john_locke Don't move .
charlie_pace Look , I was just going to take ...
john_locke Do not move .
dr_jack_shephard What's going on ?
john_locke He's standing on a beehive .
charlie_pace What's a beehive doing there ?
charlie_pace Beehives are supposed to be in trees .
dr_jack_shephard What now ?
john_locke If he moves , he'll split the hive .
charlie_pace I don't like bees , okay .
charlie_pace I have an irrational fear of bees .
charlie_pace I think I'm allergic to bees .
john_locke Please be quiet .
john_locke We need to get something to seal the hive .
kate_austen To cover it ?
john_locke Hurry .
michael_dawson I'm getting tired of saying this .
michael_dawson I was just walking the beach with my son , and all of the sudden this dude is all up on me .
michael_dawson I didn't do anything .
sayid_jarrah Surely there must be something you're not telling us .
michael_dawson Surely ?
michael_dawson Where you from man ?
sayid_jarrah Tikrit .
sayid_jarrah Iraq .
michael_dawson Okay .
michael_dawson I don't know how it is in Iraq , but in the United States of America where I'm from , Korean people don't like black people .
michael_dawson Did you know that ?
michael_dawson So maybe you ought to talk to him !
sayid_jarrah The cuffs stay on !
james_ford A little louder , Omar .
james_ford Maybe then she'll understand you .
hugo_reyes Guys , that Chinese dude is going to get pretty crispy out here .
hugo_reyes How long are you going to keep him tied down like that ?
sayid_jarrah He tried to kill Michael .
sayid_jarrah We all saw it .
sayid_jarrah The cuffs stay on until we know why .
michael_dawson Come on , man .
michael_dawson Let's go .
dr_jack_shephard Okay .
dr_jack_shephard Just keep still man .
dr_jack_shephard I'm going to try to cover the hive .
charlie_pace This is the most crap idea ever .
charlie_pace It's never going to work .
john_locke Now , pull yourself together , son .
charlie_pace It wouldn't be an irrational fear of bees if I could just pull myself together ,
charlie_pace would it ?
kate_austen Who is he .
kate_austen How'd he get here ?
dr_jack_shephard I can't exactly perform an autopsy but there doesn't seem to be any major trauma to the bones .
dr_jack_shephard There's another one over here .
dr_jack_shephard Someone laid them to rest here .
kate_austen Who ?
dr_jack_shephard I don't know .
kate_austen Where would they come from ?
dr_jack_shephard Didn't you guys shoot a polar bear last week ?
kate_austen Yeah .
dr_jack_shephard Where'd that come from ?
kate_austen Any idea how long they've been here ?
dr_jack_shephard Long .
dr_jack_shephard It takes 40 or 50 years for clothing to degrade like this .
kate_austen What is it ?
john_locke Hello ?
john_locke Anybody there ?
john_locke Everyone alright ?
dr_jack_shephard A few stings aside .
charlie_pace You two run away fantastically .
charlie_pace Glad my diversion spared you .
charlie_pace I was only stung several hundred times .
charlie_pace Oh , and uh , someone left this .
kate_austen It was , um , it was full of bees .
charlie_pace I'd have thought C's , actually .
charlie_pace Sorry .
charlie_pace Bloody Hell !
charlie_pace Are these the people who were here before us ?
john_locke What are you talking about ?
charlie_pace Uh , just , you know , the , the , there could have been people here before us , right ?
john_locke Clearly .
john_locke But , who were these men ?
dr_jack_shephard Actually , one of them is female .
john_locke Our very own Adam and Eve .
john_locke I think one of us should stay and help Charlie salvage the wreckage .
kate_austen You offering ?
john_locke Sure .
john_locke Give me a chance to get to know him a little better .
kate_austen We should move out .
kate_austen People are probably getting thirsty .
kate_austen What ?
dr_jack_shephard 46 people need to drink a half gallon a day each .
dr_jack_shephard Carrying all this water back and forth is going to be real pain in the ass .
kate_austen You're starting to make me regret volunteering .
dr_jack_shephard These caves make too good a shelter just to be used for burial .
dr_jack_shephard Adam and Eve , they must have lived here .
dr_jack_shephard Their plane crashed , or maybe they were ship-wrecked .
dr_jack_shephard They probably found this place and knew they could survive here .
dr_jack_shephard Unlimited supply of fresh water , tree canopy keeps the temperature down , shields out the sun , , the openings are narrow , easier for protection against predators .
dr_jack_shephard We don't need to bring the water to the people .
dr_jack_shephard We need to bring the people to the water . .
dr_jack_shephard I think we could live here .
michael_dawson Hey , what are you doing ?
michael_dawson You say something to my boy ?
michael_dawson Yeah , nice talking to you , too .
michael_dawson Move it , Walt .
walt_lloyd How come he doesn't like us ?
michael_dawson What ?
walt_lloyd You said people like him don't like people like us .
michael_dawson Oh man .
michael_dawson You know , uh , look , that's not true , and
michael_dawson you know what , I don't think like that anyway .
michael_dawson I was ,
michael_dawson I was angry .
walt_lloyd What did you do to him ?
michael_dawson What did I do to him ?
michael_dawson You tell me ?
michael_dawson I've been with you since we crashed .
michael_dawson Have you seen me do anything , to anyone ?
michael_dawson What kind of man do you think I am , anyway ?
michael_dawson What did your mother say about me ?
walt_lloyd She never talked about you .
michael_dawson You don't know anything about me , do you ?
walt_lloyd You don't know anything about me .
michael_dawson I know a lot about you .
walt_lloyd Yeah ?
michael_dawson Yeah .
walt_lloyd When's my birthday ?
michael_dawson August 24th .
michael_dawson When's mine ?
michael_dawson Forget it , come on , man .
sunhwa_kwon What happened to you ?
sunhwa_kwon What were you doing ?
sunhwa_kwon Whose blood is this ?
sunhwa_kwon What were you doing ?
sunhwa_kwon What happened ?
kate_austen You checking me out ?
dr_jack_shephard What ?
kate_austen No harm in it .
dr_jack_shephard Trust me , if I was checking you out , you'd know it .
kate_austen Yeah , so then what were you thinking ?
kate_austen Right now .
dr_jack_shephard Well , I sure as hell wasn't thinking that .
kate_austen Don't stop to think , just tell me .
dr_jack_shephard I was thinking that if we were living at the caves we could build a dam around that spring so that everybody could have fresh water
dr_jack_shephard and we could get the infirmary off the beach .
dr_jack_shephard You think it's a bad idea ?
kate_austen No , no .
kate_austen It makes sense .
dr_jack_shephard But ?
kate_austen No
kate_austen but .
dr_jack_shephard Good , because a lot of people are still hoping a rescue boat is going to show up .
dr_jack_shephard They're not thinking about their own safety .
dr_jack_shephard We're going to have a lot of convincing to do .
kate_austen We ?
kate_austen You still haven't convinced me yet .
charlie_pace You following me ?
john_locke Yes .
charlie_pace There's no need .
charlie_pace I'm just going to the loo .
john_locke Is there something you want to tell me , Charlie ?
charlie_pace I'm going to the loo .
john_locke It's dangerous out there .
john_locke Until we get back to the beach , I'm not breaking line of sight with you .
charlie_pace Bugger off .
john_locke I know who you are .
john_locke And I know what you're looking for .
john_locke Drive Shaft -- you played bass .
charlie_pace And guitar -- on a couple of tracks .
charlie_pace You really heard of us ?
john_locke Hey , just because I'm over 40 doesn't mean I'm deaf .
john_locke I have both your albums .
john_locke Although , I thought that your self-titled debut was a much stronger effort than Oil Change .
john_locke It's a shame what happened to the band .
john_locke How long since you played ?
charlie_pace My guitar ?
charlie_pace Uh , 8 days , 11 hours , give or take .
john_locke You miss it ?
john_locke Well , a lot of wreckage .
john_locke It might still turn up .
charlie_pace Undamaged ?
charlie_pace Still playable ?
charlie_pace I don't think so .
charlie_pace I mean , I wish , but there was this bloke at the counter
charlie_pace made me check it in .
john_locke No .
charlie_pace Yeah .
charlie_pace There wasn't enough room in the cabin , fascist .
john_locke You'll see it again .
charlie_pace Oh yeah ?
charlie_pace What makes you say that ?
john_locke Because I have faith , Charlie .
sayid_jarrah It's about time .
sayid_jarrah I am dying of thirst .
sayid_jarrah I think I'll let him sit in the sun a while longer .
sayid_jarrah Then I'll take his wife aside , find some way to communicate .
sayid_jarrah I think she knows why he attacked Michael .
dr_jack_shephard You're sure you don't want me to talk to her ?
dr_jack_shephard Okay .
dr_jack_shephard If you've got that under control I'm going to start talking to people about the caves .
dr_jack_shephard Might be able to get a few to go with me before nightfall , start setting up camp .
sayid_jarrah You're serious ?
sayid_jarrah Is there a reason you didn't consult us when you decided to form your own civilization ?
dr_jack_shephard I'm only talking about moving into the valley .
sayid_jarrah Well , what happened to live together , die alone ?
dr_jack_shephard Digging in together is the only way we're going to survive .
sayid_jarrah Our best hope of survival is in being spotted by a plane or a ship , and for that we need to organize everyone to keep that signal fire burning while others scout the Island for supplies .
sayid_jarrah Digging in anywhere else is suicide !
kate_austen It is the only source of fresh water we've found , Sayid .
dr_jack_shephard And staying on the beach , in the sun without water ?
dr_jack_shephard That's not suicide ?
sayid_jarrah I'm not going to admit defeat .
michael_dawson Now what ?
michael_dawson I already gave you my statement , sheriff .
sayid_jarrah I came to apologize .
sayid_jarrah I shouldn't have been suspicious .
sayid_jarrah You were the victim in the attack this morning .
michael_dawson I appreciate that , but I can tell you didn't come all the way over here just to say you're sorry .
sayid_jarrah People are seriously considering following Jack to the caves .
sayid_jarrah I'd like to know where you stand .
michael_dawson Right here .
michael_dawson I've got one priority right now and that's to get my kid off this Island .
michael_dawson A boat passes , I'm not going to be on the hook for missing it .
sayid_jarrah Good .
dr_jack_shephard Slowly , just a little bit at a time , little bit .
dr_jack_shephard Glad you're coming .
hugo_reyes Hey man , I go where the boar's at .
hugo_reyes So , what's up with you and Kate ?
hugo_reyes You guys going to move into a cave together , or what ?
dr_jack_shephard Sorry , am I in high school ?
hugo_reyes Well , that wasn't a denial .
dr_jack_shephard Just get your stuff together , we've got to get out of here soon .
james_ford Well , well , well , if ain't the belle of the ball ?
james_ford So what's it like having both the doctor and Captain Falafel fighting over you ?
james_ford Just call 'em how I seem 'em , Freckles .
james_ford Truth be told , I'm not the only one wondering where you're going to weigh in on this whole moving off the beach thing .
james_ford Are you going with the pessimists , or staying here and waiting for the rescue boats ?
kate_austen Are you going ?
james_ford Well , that's the real trick , isn't it ?
james_ford We all pack up stakes for the caves and the next day a plane passes by , they're going to go on their merry way and be none the wiser .
james_ford On the other hand , stay here , get eaten by boars , fall off a rock , not going to be anyone around to answer that 911 call .
kate_austen Still haven't answered my question .
james_ford You didn't answer mine .
james_ford And I asked first .
michael_dawson Oh great , look who came to chat .
sunhwa_kwon I need to talk to you .
michael_dawson You speak English ?
sunhwa_kwon Yes .
michael_dawson What ?
michael_dawson You speak English ?
michael_dawson Why didn't you say anything? !
sunhwa_kwon My husband doesn't know .
michael_dawson Why would you learn English and not tell your husband ?
sunhwa_kwon He has a bad temper .
sunhwa_kwon What my husband did to you today , it was a misunderstanding .
michael_dawson No .
michael_dawson I got it .
michael_dawson Loud and clear .
sunhwa_kwon It was the watch .
michael_dawson Your husband tried to murder me for a watch? !
michael_dawson I found this watch two days ago .
sunhwa_kwon It belongs to my father .
sunhwa_kwon Protecting that watch is a question of honor .
michael_dawson He calls trying to kill me in front of my kid , honor? !
sunhwa_kwon You don't know my father .
sunhwa_kwon I need your help .
charlie_pace Listen to me , you old git , I'm going in the jungle .
charlie_pace A man has a right to some privacy .
john_locke Just hand it to me .
john_locke You're going to run out .
john_locke My guess is sooner rather than later .
john_locke Painful detox is inevitable .
john_locke Give it up now
john_locke at least it will be your choice .
charlie_pace Don't talk to me like you know something about me .
john_locke I know a lot more about pain than you think .
john_locke I don't envy what you're facing .
john_locke But I want to help . .
john_locke Do you want your guitar ?
john_locke More than your drug ?
charlie_pace More than you know .
john_locke What I know is that this Island might just give you what you're looking for , but you have to give the Island something .
charlie_pace You really think you can find my guitar ?
john_locke Look up , Charlie .
charlie_pace You're not going to ask me to pray or something .
john_locke I want you to look up .
dr_jack_shephard Hey .
dr_jack_shephard It's almost time to go .
kate_austen I don't want to be Eve .
dr_jack_shephard No one's asking you to .
kate_austen I just can't -- dig in .
dr_jack_shephard Why not ?
dr_jack_shephard Someone else can stay here , keep a look out , wait for rescue .
dr_jack_shephard Why does it have to be you ?
kate_austen That's not it .
dr_jack_shephard Then what is it ?
dr_jack_shephard Kate , how did you get to be this way ?
dr_jack_shephard Just what is it that you did ?
kate_austen You had your chance to know .
dr_jack_shephard If you need me you know where to find me .
kate_austen You know where to find me , too .
michael_dawson I know you can't understand a word , and normally I'm not the talking out loud type , but since I have a captive audience , I hope for your sake you pay attention .
michael_dawson I'm not exactly having the best month of my life .
michael_dawson I barely knew my son , and now , I gotta be his daddy .
michael_dawson And then to top if off
michael_dawson , I have a deranged Korean guy trying to kill me and for what? !
michael_dawson Look , I get it , right .
michael_dawson It's the watch .
michael_dawson Mine broke and I found this in the wreckage , and I figured , " hey , why let a $20,000 dollar watch go to waste " ?
michael_dawson Which is ridiculous since time doesn't matter on a damn Island !
michael_dawson Stay away from me .
michael_dawson And my kid .
dr_jack_shephard Hello ?
john_locke What's this ?
dr_jack_shephard New tenants .
hugo_reyes Short walk .
hugo_reyes They lied .
walt_lloyd Can I ask you something ?
michael_dawson Anything you want , man .
walt_lloyd When's your birthday ?

hugo_reyes He wasn't on the plane .
kate_austen Who wasn't on the plane ?
hugo_reyes Ethan , the Canadian guy , he is not on the passenger manifest .
dr_jack_shephard Well , where the hell is he ?
hugo_reyes I don't know .
hugo_reyes I saw him yesterday , but now ...
dr_jack_shephard Has anyone seen Ethan ?
kate_austen Sayid's leg .
dr_jack_shephard Has anyone seen Ethan ?
michael_dawson Yeah ,
michael_dawson yeah .
michael_dawson He went to go get some wood .
michael_dawson He took off on the path to the beach .
michael_dawson Is he okay ?
michael_dawson What happened ?
dr_jack_shephard Where's Charlie ?
kate_austen What ?
dr_jack_shephard Where's Charlie ?
john_locke He went after Claire .
john_locke Jack !
dr_jack_shephard She was moving back to the beach .
dr_jack_shephard Claire .
dr_jack_shephard That's hers .
dr_jack_shephard What happened ?
dr_jack_shephard What ...
john_locke I don't know .
john_locke Footprints .
john_locke At least three distinct sets all over the place .
john_locke It looks like there might have been a struggle .
dr_jack_shephard What ?
dr_jack_shephard What is it ?
john_locke Drag marks .
john_locke Here .
john_locke And here .
dr_jack_shephard Claire and Charlie , they were together .
john_locke I think they've been taken .
dr_jack_shephard Claire! !
dr_jack_shephard Charlie !
dr_jack_shephard Claire !
john_locke Jack .
john_locke Jack .
john_locke Shhhh .
john_locke Tracks are still fresh .
dr_jack_shephard This doesn't make any sense .
dr_jack_shephard How can one man drag off two people , one of them pregnant ?
john_locke You're asking the wrong question .
john_locke Not how , why ?
dr_jack_shephard You think it was Ethan .
john_locke It certainly feels like it was Ethan , doesn't it ?
dr_jack_shephard By himself .
dr_jack_shephard How ?
john_locke We can't account for all of our people .
john_locke And , more importantly , who's to say they're even our people ?
dr_jack_shephard What ?
john_locke Sayid said there were others .
dr_jack_shephard Sayid said we're not alone .
john_locke Semantics .
dr_jack_shephard Sayid's injured .
dr_jack_shephard We're not even sure where he went .
dr_jack_shephard He's delirious .
john_locke I'm just telling you what the ground is telling me .
dr_jack_shephard So which way is the ground telling you that they went ?
john_locke Jack , we don't know what's going on here .
dr_jack_shephard We know enough .
john_locke We need to prepare .
john_locke We could be back at the caves in 10 minutes , organize a search party , get wea-
dr_jack_shephard Which way did they go , Locke ?
nurse ...
nurse stats are dropping .
dr_jack_shephard C'mon , c'mon .
nurse #2 BP's falling .
nurse She's bleeding out .
dr_jack_shephard No , I've got the artery almost there .
nurse She's in arrest .
dr_jack_shephard 1 milligram epi .
dr_jack_shephard Let's get the crash cart over here .
dr_jack_shephard Alright , artery's sealed .
dr_jack_shephard Close her up .
nurse Defib .
dr_jack_shephard Charge
nurse Charged .
dr_jack_shephard Clear .
dr_jack_shephard Charge .
nurse We're charged .
dr_jack_shephard Clear .
dr_jack_shephard Come on , come on back now , come on .
dr_jack_shephard Come on now .
dr_jack_shephard Come on back .
dr_jack_shephard Come on .
dr_christian_shephard Call it .
dr_jack_shephard Come on , baby , come back .
dr_jack_shephard Come back .
dr_jack_shephard Come on , baby , come on .
dr_jack_shephard Come on now .
dr_jack_shephard You can do this .
dr_jack_shephard Come on .
dr_jack_shephard Come on .
dr_christian_shephard Call it , Jack .
dr_christian_shephard It's over , call it .
dr_jack_shephard You call it .
kate_austen You let him go alone ?
john_locke Don't worry .
john_locke I'll catch up .
john_locke What's the word from the beach ?
kate_austen Nothing .
kate_austen Nobody has seen him .
kate_austen I'm coming with you .
john_locke I figured you might .
shannon_rutherford What are you doing ?
shannon_rutherford We need to get our water and get back to the beach ...
boone_carlyle I heard you're forming a search party .
boone_carlyle Can I help ?
shannon_rutherford This is a deserted Island .
shannon_rutherford There's no choppers , no Amber Alerts .
shannon_rutherford How exactly are you going to find them ?
john_locke By following Ethan's trail .
john_locke No one can walk through the wilderness without leaving signs , bending blades of grass , breaking twigs , especially with captives in tow .
john_locke And yes , I could use another hand if you're up for it .
boone_carlyle I'm up for it .
john_locke Then let's get moving .
walt_lloyd I could take Vincent , and he could sniff something that belonged to Charlie .
walt_lloyd And I can help .
michael_dawson I said no , man .
michael_dawson Hey , Locke .
michael_dawson Hey , look , you know , a lot of us don't just want to sit here waiting for news .
john_locke Thanks , but we're set .
john_locke Anyone else will just slow us down .
michael_dawson Okay .
michael_dawson Maybe I'll just put together another party .
john_locke Good idea .
john_locke We're going north .
john_locke I suggest you go south .
michael_dawson Come on .
dr_christian_shephard I never thought I'd see the day , Jack .
dr_christian_shephard You barge into my O.R .
dr_christian_shephard You work on my patient .
dr_jack_shephard You didn't have to do this procedure .
dr_christian_shephard I don't have to do anything .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , of course , you don't .
dr_christian_shephard I chose to do this procedure , this emergency procedure , because when this girl crashed in the ER , they called me .
dr_jack_shephard I was right upstairs .
dr_christian_shephard And you should have stayed upstairs .
dr_christian_shephard And how did you find out ?
dr_jack_shephard One of the nurses came to get me .
dr_christian_shephard Who ?
dr_christian_shephard Oh , thank god
dr_christian_shephard I have you and some anonymous nurse to rescue me .
dr_jack_shephard She told me that your hands were shaking .
dr_christian_shephard My hands were not ...
dr_jack_shephard You cut her hepatic artery .
dr_christian_shephard She was in a car crash , Jack .
dr_christian_shephard Her insides were a mess .
dr_jack_shephard You made a mistake .
dr_christian_shephard They called me .
dr_christian_shephard I ...
dr_jack_shephard I don't care whether they called you .
dr_jack_shephard You made a mistake .
dr_christian_shephard Are you lecturing me? !
dr_christian_shephard You tell me , if you were upstairs , and I was in a restaurant having lunch , then why did they call me ?
dr_jack_shephard How many drinks did you have at lunch , dad ?
john_locke Jack .
john_locke Jack .
john_locke It's a good thing you were going in a circle .
john_locke Not much of a search grid , but we never would have found you otherwise .
kate_austen Did you find anything ?
dr_jack_shephard No .
john_locke You should go back to the caves -- Sayid's leg .
dr_jack_shephard I dressed Sayid's leg .
dr_jack_shephard You found me , we can find Charlie and Claire .
dr_jack_shephard Now , do we have a trail to follow or not ?
john_locke Jack , this was my fault .
dr_jack_shephard What ?
john_locke I hunted with Ethan .
john_locke I spent time with him .
john_locke I never sensed anything -- off .
john_locke But for everything that I know about hunting , tracking -- whoever he is , he knows more .
john_locke If we catch up with him , I don't want anything to happen to the only trained physician on the Island .
john_locke So go back , be the doctor .
john_locke Let me be the hunter .
dr_jack_shephard Can we go now ?
john_locke Follow me .
michael_dawson I'm trying to help and all the guy can tell me is go south ?
michael_dawson Like what ?
michael_dawson I'm going to get in his way or something ?
hugo_reyes We're all tweaked , man .
hugo_reyes Locke's just feeling it like the rest of us .
michael_dawson So , what ?
michael_dawson There's five other guys who would've gone out there with me , putting our necks on the line to find Charlie and Claire .
michael_dawson All I'm saying is I'm getting sick of getting treated like a second class citizen around here because Mount Baldy can bag a boar .
walt_lloyd He knows a lot more than how to catch a boar .
walt_lloyd Mr .
walt_lloyd Locke is a warrior .
walt_lloyd He can hunt , he can track stuff , and he's the only who brought knives .
walt_lloyd So , if it were me , I would listen to him .
michael_dawson Well , I don't want you to .
michael_dawson You understand ?
michael_dawson You stay with Hurley .
michael_dawson I may not be a warrior , but I am going south .
hugo_reyes Back home , I'm known as something of a warrior myself .
john_locke We mark our progress by line of sight .
john_locke We tie these off so we don't get lost .
boone_carlyle You can lead us back to camp , right ?
john_locke If nothing happens to me .
boone_carlyle Maybe I better take marker detail .
dr_jack_shephard Anything ?
john_locke Not yet .
dr_jack_shephard If you can't find the trail ...
john_locke I'll pick it up again , alright ?
john_locke We need to rest for a minute to get our clarity back .
dr_jack_shephard You're going to take a break ?
dr_jack_shephard It's got to be almost 4 o'clock .
dr_jack_shephard When the sun sets there's no way ...
john_locke It's 425 .
john_locke And , yes , I'm taking a break .
kate_austen Can I talk to you for a sec ?
kate_austen Would it kill you to give the guy a little space ?
dr_jack_shephard It might .
kate_austen Stop that .
dr_jack_shephard What ?
kate_austen That .
kate_austen What's going on ?
dr_jack_shephard I didn't believe her -- Claire .
dr_jack_shephard I gave her a sedative .
kate_austen Jack , you can't ...
dr_jack_shephard She told me someone was after her , that she was being attacked , and I
dr_jack_shephard -- she just seemed so out of it .
dr_jack_shephard I thought that her pregnancy was amping up her stress and
dr_jack_shephard I ...
dr_jack_shephard I didn't believe her .
john_locke Jack !
kate_austen What is it ?
john_locke Look familiar ?
dr_jack_shephard It's Charlie's .
boone_carlyle You think it just came off ?
dr_jack_shephard No .
dr_jack_shephard He's leaving us a trail .
dr_jack_shephard They went this way .
john_locke I'm not so sure .
john_locke There's another trail here .
dr_jack_shephard What do mean , another ?
john_locke These are footprints .
john_locke People moved off this way .
dr_jack_shephard Charlie's leaving these for us to follow .
dr_jack_shephard They went that way .
kate_austen Unless Charlie isn't the one leaving them .
kate_austen If Ethan knows that we're behind him , he could be setting up a dummy trail .
kate_austen Take off in one direction , double-back his own footprints .
boone_carlyle Wait ?
boone_carlyle Now you're a tracker ?
john_locke You're just full of surprises .
dr_jack_shephard So , we've got two trails .
dr_jack_shephard Let's split up , I'll take that one .
john_locke No .
john_locke We should stay together , Jack .
dr_jack_shephard Why ?
dr_jack_shephard We've got two trails , and , apparently , two trackers .
john_locke Be careful .
james_ford Who got taken by what ?
walt_lloyd Charlie and Claire , they think Ethan took them .
james_ford Ethan took them , huh ?
walt_lloyd Yeah .
james_ford Took them why ?
james_ford And who the hell is Ethan ?
walt_lloyd I don't know .
walt_lloyd He wasn't on the list thing , the manifest .
james_ford Ever think he might have lied about his name ?
walt_lloyd It's stupid to lie about your name .
james_ford Alrighty , Tattoo , where do you think Ethan came from ?
walt_lloyd Maybe he was already on the Island , before we were .
james_ford You got yourself one hell of an imagination , kid .
walt_lloyd There could be lots of other people on the Island .
james_ford So a tribe of evil natives planted a ringer in the camp to kidnap a pregnant girl and a reject from VH-1
james_ford has-beens ?
james_ford Yeah , fiendishly clever .
james_ford And why am I getting the evening news from a 6 year old ?
walt_lloyd I'm 10 .
james_ford Okay , then it must be true .
walt_lloyd If you don't believe me , ask Sayid .
walt_lloyd He said we're not alone .
james_ford Sayid's back ?
boone_carlyle Red shirt .
john_locke Huh ?
boone_carlyle Red shirt .
boone_carlyle Ever watch " Star Trek " ?
john_locke Nah , not really .
boone_carlyle The crew guys that would go down to the planet with the main guys , the captain and the guy with the pointy ears , they always wore red shirts .
boone_carlyle And they always got killed .
john_locke Yeah ?
boone_carlyle Yeah .
john_locke Sounds like a piss-poor captain .
boone_carlyle What do you do in the real world , Mr .
boone_carlyle Locke ?
john_locke It's John .
boone_carlyle John .
john_locke Why don't you guess ?
boone_carlyle Well , you're either a taxidermist or a hit man ?
john_locke I was a regional collection supervisor for a box company .
boone_carlyle A box company ?
john_locke They made boxes .
boone_carlyle Yeah , right .
kate_austen Please , slow down .
dr_jack_shephard You said they went this way .
kate_austen I think they went this way .
kate_austen I'm not as good at this as Locke is .
dr_jack_shephard So where did you pick up the tracking skills , Kate ?
dr_jack_shephard Was that before or after you were on the run ?
kate_austen I'm trying to help , Jack .
dr_jack_shephard You know what might help ?
dr_jack_shephard A little honesty .
dr_jack_shephard Just give me something real , anything .
kate_austen My dad was in the army .
kate_austen Ranger Battalion .
kate_austen We were stationed in Fort Lewis , Washington State .
kate_austen We'd go hiking together .
kate_austen One day we spend 8 hours tracking deer .
kate_austen Being in the woods , it was like -- it was like his religion .
kate_austen That was real .
kate_austen Anything you want to share , Jack ?
dr_christian_shephard Oh , thanks for coming in , Jack .
dr_christian_shephard Have a seat .
dr_jack_shephard What does it say ?
dr_christian_shephard The truth , that a patient was brought to the ER following a car accident , rushed into surgery with massive internal bleeding -- you joined me , and in spite of our most heroic efforts , the patient succumbed to her injuries .
dr_jack_shephard Looks like you fixed everything but the patient .
dr_jack_shephard You had no business being in O.R .
dr_christian_shephard Do you really think I would have walked in there if I couldn't handle it ?
dr_jack_shephard You've done it before .
dr_christian_shephard That's right , I have , because I am perfectly capable of making those ...
dr_jack_shephard How can you say that after what happened yesterday ?
dr_christian_shephard The problem is not that ...
dr_jack_shephard You were impaired .
dr_christian_shephard I know my limits .
dr_jack_shephard I won't sign this .
dr_christian_shephard You're a part of the team , Jack .
dr_christian_shephard I'm not the only one on the hook for this .
dr_christian_shephard You called me off .
dr_christian_shephard You were the surgeon of record when she died .
dr_christian_shephard Look , accidents happen in surgeries all the time , Jack .
dr_christian_shephard That's the truth
dr_christian_shephard and you know it .
dr_christian_shephard But if you contradict this report , if you mention alcohol , well , that's the only fact that's going to matter .
dr_christian_shephard They'll strip me of my license .
dr_jack_shephard Yes , they will .
dr_christian_shephard I know I have been hard on you , but that is how you make a soft metal into steel .
dr_christian_shephard That is why you are the most gifted young surgeon in this city .
dr_christian_shephard And this , this is a career that is all about the greater good .
dr_christian_shephard I've had to sacrifice certain aspects of my relationship with you so that hundreds and thousands of patients will live because of your extraordinary skills .
dr_christian_shephard I know it's a long , a long time coming .
dr_christian_shephard What happened yesterday , I promise you , will never happen again .
dr_christian_shephard And after all what I've given -- this is not just about my career , Jack .
dr_christian_shephard It's my life .
dr_christian_shephard Thank you , son .
dr_christian_shephard Thank you .
james_ford Well , well , well .
james_ford I don't know if you Islams got a concept of karma , but I get the sense
james_ford this Island just served you up a heaping platter of cosmic payback .
sayid_jarrah What do you want ?
james_ford Dr .
james_ford Do-Right doesn't trust me with his antibiotics
james_ford so I have to hump it up here everyday just to get my meds .
james_ford You know , a less magnanimous man than I might just be thinking he could beat the ever-living-snot out of you right now without fear of reprisal .
sayid_jarrah You want to take a shot ?
sayid_jarrah Take it .
sayid_jarrah But know that I left this camp out of shame for what I did to you .
sayid_jarrah It was never my intention to return .
james_ford Sorry , fresh out of sweet forgiveness .
james_ford If it wasn't your intention to return , then why did you ?
sayid_jarrah I was taken prisoner by the French woman .
james_ford The one who's been sending out a distress signal for 16 years ?
james_ford She's alive ?
sayid_jarrah She was on a science expedition .
sayid_jarrah She said their ship wrecked .
james_ford She alone ?
sayid_jarrah She said that there are others on this Island .
james_ford Her people ?
sayid_jarrah No .
sayid_jarrah She believed they had all gotten sick .
sayid_jarrah She murdered her entire team .
james_ford Right .
james_ford And these others , who the hell are they ?
sayid_jarrah I don't know .
sayid_jarrah She's never seen them .
james_ford Oh , she's never seen them , but she knows they're there .
sayid_jarrah If you believe her .
james_ford Do you ?
sayid_jarrah Maybe .
sayid_jarrah Maybe not .
sayid_jarrah But on my way back I heard something in the jungle surrounding me .
james_ford Something like what ?
sayid_jarrah Have you got something to say to me , Sawyer , or are you going to continue asking me questions
sayid_jarrah you know I don't have the answers to ?
james_ford Tide's coming up the beach .
james_ford Plane hull's almost in the water .
james_ford Kept your signal fire burning .
hugo_reyes Crap .
walt_lloyd Your blacks can't get in .
hugo_reyes Yeah , I know my blacks can't get in .
walt_lloyd My roll .
hugo_reyes Yahoo .
walt_lloyd Need a 4-3 .
hugo_reyes Dude , would you please roll ?
walt_lloyd Yes .
hugo_reyes No !
walt_lloyd Your turn .
walt_lloyd It's okay
walt_lloyd , I wasn't very good when I first started playing , either .
hugo_reyes I didn't just start playing .
hugo_reyes I took 17th in a tournament once .
walt_lloyd 17th is not very good .
hugo_reyes No , 17th is very good .
walt_lloyd C'mon double 6's , double 6's .
walt_lloyd Yes .
hugo_reyes Aw , you've got to be kidding me ,
walt_lloyd I'm lucky .
hugo_reyes No one is that lucky .
walt_lloyd My dad said I was the luckiest person he ever knew .
hugo_reyes Really ?
walt_lloyd Not Michael , Brian .
walt_lloyd My other dad .
walt_lloyd Yeah , um . . .
walt_lloyd Yes !
walt_lloyd Yes !
walt_lloyd C'mon , one more game , double or nothing .
hugo_reyes Can't .
hugo_reyes I have a meeting .
walt_lloyd A meeting ?
hugo_reyes Yeah .
hugo_reyes A meeting .
walt_lloyd You owe me 20 thousand dollars !
hugo_reyes You'll get it .
boone_carlyle It's been all 15 minutes since we've seen any sign .
boone_carlyle What are we following ?
john_locke My gut .
boone_carlyle Great .
john_locke So , Boone , what did you do in the real world ?
boone_carlyle I run a business .
john_locke What kind of business ?
boone_carlyle Uh , it's a wedding thing .
john_locke Huh ?
boone_carlyle My mother has this empire .
boone_carlyle The Martha Stewart of matrimony .
boone_carlyle I run one of the subsidiaries .
john_locke So who's running it now ?
boone_carlyle I guess it doesn't matter , does it ?
john_locke I'm sure there are people who can handle it , temporarily .
john_locke It's going to start raining , in one minute .
boone_carlyle 1 minute ?
john_locke Give or take a few seconds .
john_locke You should turn around , Boone , and head back .
boone_carlyle What ?
john_locke The trail's been cold for a quarter mile , dangerous terrain ahead .
john_locke If you start now , you'll make it back to camp before dark .
boone_carlyle What about you ?
john_locke I can take care of myself .
boone_carlyle No , I'm not heading back .
john_locke I admire your courage , but ...
boone_carlyle I'm not heading back .
john_locke Alright .
boone_carlyle They teach you how to predict the weather in a box company? !
dr_jack_shephard I guess we were right .
dr_jack_shephard Where to now ?
kate_austen Jack ?
kate_austen Jack , where are you going ?
kate_austen Jack ?
dr_jack_shephard Didn't you hear her ?
kate_austen What ?
kate_austen Hear , hear who ?
kate_austen Jack !
dr_ethan_rom If you do not stop following me , I will kill one of them .
dr_ethan_rom Do you understand ?
dr_ethan_rom No more warnings .
andrea Dr .
andrea Shephard .
dr_jack_shephard Andrea .
dr_jack_shephard Andrea , that man that my father is talking to , who is that ?
andrea That's her husband .
andrea He's threatening to sue .
kate_austen Jack , Jack .
kate_austen Jack , are you okay ?
dr_jack_shephard How long was I out ?
kate_austen I don't know
kate_austen , I'm sorry , you slid on the rocks and ...
dr_jack_shephard Ethan ?
kate_austen What ?
dr_jack_shephard Ethan was here .
kate_austen You banged your head , Jack .
dr_jack_shephard No , no .
dr_jack_shephard He was here .
kate_austen You have to stop .
kate_austen The rain has washed away the trail .
kate_austen Even if he was here -- you've got -- Jack !
dr_jack_shephard I'm not letting him do this .
kate_austen Not letting him? !
dr_jack_shephard Not again .
dr_christian_shephard We realized that her blood pressure was continuing to drop precipitously , at which point the patient went into cardiac arrest .
dr_christian_shephard Of course , every effort was made to resuscitate her , but the severity of her injuries , the amount of internal bleeding , made that impossible .
dr_christian_shephard Now , in my professional opinion , ladies and gentlemen , and that's all I have , by the time I was called in the damage was irreversible .
head_doctor Okay , thanks , Christian .
head_doctor Sorry about this formality .
dr_christian_shephard Of course .
head_doctor Just one final detail
head_doctor -- you were aware of the patient's pregnancy when you went into the procedure ?
dr_christian_shephard Absolutely .
dr_christian_shephard The patient's husband had informed the attending in the ER .
dr_christian_shephard It was , however , extremely early in the pregnancy , so our primary focus had to be on the mother .
head_doctor Okay , then .
head_doctor I think we're done here .
head_doctor The final report will be filed .
dr_christian_shephard Okay .
dr_jack_shephard I need to -- revise my statement .
dr_jack_shephard I didn't come into the O.R .
dr_jack_shephard until well into the procedure .
dr_christian_shephard Jack ?
dr_jack_shephard I was warned by one of the nurses that my father was operating ...
dr_jack_shephard under the influence .
dr_christian_shephard Jack .
dr_christian_shephard This is not ...
dr_jack_shephard By the time I got there it was clear that my father was not only incapacitated , but that he had also severed the patient's hepatic artery , which , in my professional opinion , caused the crisis which led to her death .
dr_jack_shephard No .
dr_jack_shephard You've got to cut him down .
dr_jack_shephard Hold on , Charlie .
dr_jack_shephard Hold on there .
kate_austen I can't reach !
kate_austen Pull him over to me !
dr_jack_shephard He's not breathing .
dr_jack_shephard C'mon , breathe , Charlie .
dr_jack_shephard C'mon , breathe .
dr_jack_shephard C'mon .
dr_jack_shephard C'mon .
dr_jack_shephard C'mon , Charlie , c'mon !
dr_jack_shephard C'mon , c'mon , Charlie , c'mon !
kate_austen Jack , Jack stop , he's not ... !
kate_austen Jack , stop , he's not coming ...
kate_austen It's okay
kate_austen , it's okay .
dr_jack_shephard No , no .
kate_austen Jack , Jack !
kate_austen Stop !
kate_austen Stop !
dr_jack_shephard C'mon !
dr_jack_shephard C'mon .
dr_jack_shephard Just breathe , breathe .
dr_jack_shephard Breathe deep , breathe deep .
dr_jack_shephard You're okay .
walt_lloyd Dad !
walt_lloyd They brought Charlie back .
walt_lloyd But he hasn't said anything since he came back .
michael_dawson They find Claire ?
dr_jack_shephard Does that hurt ?
dr_jack_shephard How's your breathing ?
dr_jack_shephard Charlie , you've got to talk to me .
dr_jack_shephard We're going to back out and look for Claire the moment the sun comes up , and I could really use your help .
dr_jack_shephard Anything that you can tell me about what you remember , where you were going .
dr_jack_shephard Did you see or hear ... ?
charlie_pace I didn't see anything , hear anything .
charlie_pace I don't remember anything .
charlie_pace Claire ...
dr_jack_shephard What ?
charlie_pace That's all they wanted .
dr_jack_shephard They ?
charlie_pace All they wanted was Claire .
shannon_rutherford They aren't back yet .
kate_austen I'm sure they just made camp for the night .
kate_austen If there's anyone on this Island that your brother's safe with , it's Locke .
boone_carlyle Are we lost ?
john_locke No , Boone , we're not lost .
boone_carlyle Sorry , it's just ...

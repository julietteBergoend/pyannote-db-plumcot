michael_dawson Walt , you gotta keep that dog quiet .
walt_lloyd I don't know what's wrong with him .
walt_lloyd Come on , Vincent , cut that out .
michael_dawson Sorry , hey , sorry , sorry .
kate_austen What is it ?
claire_littleton Somebody's in there .
sayid_jarrah Everyone in there's dead .
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer .
james_ford Right behind you , Jackass .
kate_austen Jack ?
james_ford I'm gonna shed some light on this thing .
dr_jack_shephard Run .
hugo_reyes Oh crud , now what ?
sayid_jarrah They're gone .
charlie_pace What the bloody hell was that ?
john_locke Boars .
dr_jack_shephard Those boars were looking to feed .
dr_jack_shephard We have to get rid of the bodies .
charlie_pace Bury them ?
charlie_pace There's a whole bunch in there .
sayid_jarrah More than twenty .
sayid_jarrah Digging will be difficult without shovels .
dr_jack_shephard We're not burying them .
dr_jack_shephard We need to burn them .
kate_austen They're people .
dr_jack_shephard I know they're people , Kate .
sayid_jarrah Burning the remains , they deserve better than that .
dr_jack_shephard Better than what ?
dr_jack_shephard Being eaten by wild animals ?
dr_jack_shephard Because that's what's going to happen .
dr_jack_shephard Any bodies we bury are not going to stay buried for very long .
dr_jack_shephard Look , I know this seems harsh , but that fuselage in the sun-it's not about what they deserve .
dr_jack_shephard They're gone , and we're not .
sayid_jarrah What you say may be true , but for us to decide how these people are laid to rest-it's not right .
sayid_jarrah No regard for their wishes ?
sayid_jarrah Their religions ?
dr_jack_shephard We don't have time to sort out everybody's god .
charlie_pace Really , last I heard we were positively made of time .
dr_jack_shephard Look , I'm not happy about it either , but we crashed a thousand miles off course .
dr_jack_shephard They're looking for us in the wrong place .
dr_jack_shephard It's been 4 days , no one's come .
dr_jack_shephard Tomorrow morning we need everyone to start gathering up wood , dried brush , and turn that fuselage into a furnace .
dr_jack_shephard Wait until the sun goes down tomorrow night before we start the fire .
charlie_pace If he's so eager to burn the bodies why are we waiting until sundown ?
kate_austen He's hoping someone will see it .
kate_austen Looks like I'm not the only who couldn't sleep last night .
sayid_jarrah There are better things to do with my time than collect firewood .
kate_austen You don't agree with Jack .
kate_austen What are you making ?
sayid_jarrah Too soon to talk about .
sayid_jarrah I'm not sure it will even work .
kate_austen You're trying to pick up the transmission aren't you ?
kate_austen The one we heard on the transceiver .
sayid_jarrah If the French woman's transmission has truly been playing on a loop for 16 years then there must be a power source on the Island .
sayid_jarrah A significant one .
kate_austen And you can find it ?
sayid_jarrah Hypothetically
sayid_jarrah , yes .
sayid_jarrah I'm making an antenna of sorts .
sayid_jarrah With a few of these mounted at different points on the Island I may be able to use the transceiver to triangulate the signal , find out where it's coming from .
kate_austen So what can I do to help ?
sayid_jarrah It appears you are as anxious to get off this Island as I am .
walt_lloyd Catch the ball , catch the ball , Vincent .
walt_lloyd Good boy , good job Vincent .
michael_dawson Hey , hey , where you going , man ?
walt_lloyd Nowhere , I just thought I'd see what Mr . Locke was doing .
michael_dawson Hey , why don't you help your dad with the wood .
michael_dawson I'm sure
michael_dawson Mr .
michael_dawson Locke doesn't want a kid hanging around him all day anyway .
walt_lloyd At least he talks to me .
walt_lloyd Come on , Vincent .
hugo_reyes What's your problem ?
hugo_reyes Hand them over .
james_ford How about no ?
hugo_reyes There's other people here or don't you give a crap ?
james_ford Well if one of us wouldn't eat more than his fair share ...
hugo_reyes Oh that's bull
hugo_reyes and you know it .
hugo_reyes You're not happy unless you're screwing over everybody ...
james_ford Hey I'm peachy , pork pie .
dr_jack_shephard Guys , knock it off .
james_ford Stay out of this , Metro .
dr_jack_shephard What's going on ?
hugo_reyes Jethro here's hoarding the last of the peanuts .
james_ford My own stash .
james_ford I found it in there .
dr_jack_shephard What about the rest of the food ?
hugo_reyes There is no rest of the food , dude .
hugo_reyes We kind of-ate it all .
shannon_rutherford What ?
dr_jack_shephard Okay everybody , just calm down .
sayid_jarrah We can find food .
sayid_jarrah There are plenty of things on this Island we can use for sustenance .
james_ford And exactly how are we going to find this sustenance .
john_locke We hunt .
kate_austen How'd you get that knife on the plane ?
john_locke Checked it .
dr_jack_shephard You either have very good aim , or very bad aim ,
dr_jack_shephard Mr ...
michael_dawson Locke .
michael_dawson His name is Locke .
dr_jack_shephard Okay
dr_jack_shephard Mr .
dr_jack_shephard Locke , what is it that we're hunting ?
john_locke We know there are wild boar on the Island .
john_locke Razorbacks , by the look of them .
john_locke The ones that came into the camp last night were piglets , 100 , 150 pounds each .
john_locke Which means that there's a mother nearby .
john_locke A 250 pound rat , with scimitar-like tusks , and a surly disposition , who'd love nothing more than to eviscerate anything that comes near .
john_locke Boar's usual mode of attack is to circle around and charge from behind
john_locke so I figure it'll take at least three of us to distract her long enough for me to flank one of the piglets , pin it , and slit its throat .
james_ford And you gave him his knife back ?
dr_jack_shephard Well , if you've got a better idea .
james_ford Better than the three of you wandering into the magic forest to bag a hunk of ham with nothing but a little bitty hunting knife ?
james_ford Hell
james_ford no , it's the best idea I ever heard .
hugo_reyes Who is this guy ?
john_locke Yes ?
GL12#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode04 Colonel Locke , is this line secure ?
john_locke Line secure GL12 , go ahead .
GL12#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode04 Target area is acquired .
GL12#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode04 Maneuvers are a go for 1300 hours .
GL12#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode04 Repeat we are a GO .
john_locke Roger that .
john_locke We'll convene at the usual rendezvous point at 1300 hours .
randy Locke .
randy I told you I need those TPS reports done by noon today .
randy Not 1230 ; not 1215
randy ; noon .
john_locke I heard you the first time , Randy .
randy And no personal calls during office hours , Colonel .
dr_jack_shephard So ?
dr_jack_shephard Hunting boar , now , huh ?
kate_austen Who says it's my first time boar hunting ?
dr_jack_shephard Uh-huh .
dr_jack_shephard Tell me something , how come every time there's a hike into the heart of darkness you sign up ?
dr_jack_shephard You know what's in there .
kate_austen Actually , I don't .
kate_austen And neither do you .
dr_jack_shephard What's your feel on our new friend ?
kate_austen Seems to know what he's doing .
dr_jack_shephard Call me paranoid , but anyone who packs a suitcase full of knives ?
kate_austen If I didn't know any better , I'd say your worried about me , Jack .
dr_jack_shephard If I didn't know any better , I'd say you have a problem staying in one place for very long , Kate .
dr_jack_shephard So , you want to tell me why you're really going ?
kate_austen Sayid gave me this so he can triangulate the distress signal we heard-find the source .
dr_jack_shephard This isn't about boars .
kate_austen I'm a vegetarian .
walt_lloyd But why can't I come ?
michael_dawson Because I said so .
michael_dawson Hi , hi , excuse me .
michael_dawson Um , I am going off , away , to hunt , and um , I was wondering if you could keep an eye on my boy , Walt .
michael_dawson And , I'm Michael .
michael_dawson Anyway , could you watch him for me , until I come back ?
sunhwa_kwon 아 ...
sunhwa_kwon 아드님은 제가 잘 돌보고 있을게요 .
sunhwa_kwon 예 ...
michael_dawson Sorry I don't understand , but you're cool with this , right ?
walt_lloyd I don't need a babysitter .
michael_dawson Come on , Vincent needs you here .
michael_dawson And , hey , cheer up .
michael_dawson This will give me a chance to get to know your friend Mr .
michael_dawson Locke a little better .
sunhwa_kwon 너무 걱정하지 마 .
sunhwa_kwon 아버지 괜찮으실 거야 .
walt_lloyd Yeah , whatever .
claire_littleton Excuse me .
claire_littleton Doctor ?
dr_jack_shephard Claire , right ?
dr_jack_shephard How's the .
claire_littleton Oh , he's good , yeah , thanks .
claire_littleton Um , I thought maybe you should see this .
claire_littleton Someone found it in there .
claire_littleton They're collecting all the belongings .
claire_littleton They're wedding plans for Steve and Kristin .
claire_littleton They were on the plane sitting a couple of rows behind me .
claire_littleton I remember because they looked so happy .
dr_jack_shephard I don't understand , Claire , what am I supposed to do with this ?
claire_littleton Oh , well , um , some of us were wondering if maybe we should do some kind of memorial service , or something .
claire_littleton You could lead it .
dr_jack_shephard Uh , no , I don't think it ...
claire_littleton Well , you know , just a few words , or we could just read their names from passports , and drivers ...
dr_jack_shephard Look , it's not my thing .
claire_littleton Oh , okay .
claire_littleton Maybe I'll do it .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , sounds fine .
dr_jack_shephard Whatever everybody wants .
boone_carlyle That woman's still sitting there .
shannon_rutherford Mmmhmmm .
boone_carlyle Her husband was on the plane .
shannon_rutherford Right .
boone_carlyle Are you even listening to me ?
shannon_rutherford What's a four letter word for I don't care ?
boone_carlyle I just think somebody should go talk to her .
shannon_rutherford I nominate you , Captain America .
shannon_rutherford You just can't help yourself , can you ?
boone_carlyle Yeah , well , at least you don't have to worry about starving with me taking care of you .
shannon_rutherford I'm not going to starve .
boone_carlyle Right , what are you going to eat ?
shannon_rutherford The ocean's full of fish .
boone_carlyle I hate to break it to you-
boone_carlyle the ocean is not going to take your gold card .
shannon_rutherford You really don't think I can't catch a fish ?
kate_austen You find something ?
john_locke The ground here has been rooted up .
john_locke That's how boars get the majority of their food , they dig .
john_locke Afterwards they generally wallow in the dirt , rub up against the trees , scoring them with their tusks .
michael_dawson Okay .
michael_dawson So what's all that mean ?
john_locke Means we're close .
shannon_rutherford Hi .
charlie_pace Hi .
charlie_pace Shannon , right ?
shannon_rutherford Yeah .
shannon_rutherford Are you doing anything ?
charlie_pace Me ?
charlie_pace No , I was just , uh .
charlie_pace What are you doing ?
shannon_rutherford I was just going to go for a walk .
shannon_rutherford Do you want to come ?
charlie_pace Yeah , yes , sure .
shannon_rutherford Can I ask you something ?
charlie_pace Oh , I wondered when this was going to come up .
charlie_pace Yes , I'm the bass guitarist in Dri ...
shannon_rutherford Do you know anything about fishing ?
charlie_pace What ?
charlie_pace Fishing ?
charlie_pace My grand-dad used to take me out , taught me everything he knows .
charlie_pace Everything he knew , he's dead now , god rest his soul .
charlie_pace Yeah , I'm like a ...
charlie_pace I'm a fishing fiend .
charlie_pace I mean England's an island
charlie_pace so I just throw it in and ... fish .
shannon_rutherford Good .
boone_carlyle Hey doc , you got a second ?
dr_jack_shephard What's up ?
boone_carlyle The woman's been sitting over there by herself .
boone_carlyle Maybe she's having trouble dealing with her husband ?
boone_carlyle I don't think she's had anything to eat or drink .
boone_carlyle Think maybe you can go talk to her ?
dr_jack_shephard Why me ?
dr_jack_shephard I'm not a psychiatrist .
dr_jack_shephard I mean , maybe you should ...
boone_carlyle I just thought you might want to do it .
boone_carlyle You're the one that saved her life .
dr_jack_shephard Hi .
dr_jack_shephard Rose
dr_jack_shephard , right ?
dr_jack_shephard Remember me , seat 23A ?
dr_jack_shephard I'm the guy that told you not to worry about the turbulence .
dr_jack_shephard Everybody's getting pretty worried about you , Rose .
dr_jack_shephard If you want to be alone that's fine , but you have to take care of yourself .
dr_jack_shephard You should really drink .
dr_jack_shephard Okay .
dr_jack_shephard We don't have to talk .
dr_jack_shephard Let's just sit for a while .
kate_austen Your son , how's he handling all of this ?
michael_dawson A hell of a lot better than I am .
kate_austen You must be proud .
kate_austen He's a brave kid .
michael_dawson Yeah .
michael_dawson I can't take credit for that .
michael_dawson I wasn't part of his life .
michael_dawson Till his mother passed away , two weeks ago .
kate_austen I'm sorry .
kate_austen I didn't know .
michael_dawson That's okay .
michael_dawson There were living in Sydney the past couple of years .
michael_dawson I flew out last week , you know , to go get him .
michael_dawson What were you doing in Australia ?

randy Hallmark , huh ?
randy Tell me more about being a leader , Locke .
randy While you're at it , tell me about this Col . thing .

randy Experience the dream journeys of the fabled Australian Outback .
randy "
john_locke You have no right taking that off my desk .
randy So , you wander around hunting and gathering food , right ?
randy On foot ?
john_locke Not that you would understand , but a Walkabout is a journey of spiritual renewal , where one derives strength from the earth .
john_locke And becomes inseparable from it .
john_locke I have vacation days , I'm going , Randy .
john_locke I've already made a reservation .
GL12#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode04 Wow .

john_locke That's none of your business .
randy What is it with you Locke ?
randy Why do you torture yourself ?
randy I mean , imagining you're some hunter ?

charlie_pace Sorry .
charlie_pace You , you said you knew how to fish .
hugo_reyes Yeah , off the Santa Monica pier with my old man and a fishing pole and bait .
hugo_reyes Never had to try and poke one with a sharp stick .
charlie_pace Well , I really appreciate you helping me out , thanks .
hugo_reyes Anything to keep me far away from that fuselage and that freakin' redneck jerk .
hugo_reyes Damn it , crap , crap , son of a ...

sayid_jarrah Thank you .
claire_littleton Sure .
rose_nadler His fingers swell .
dr_jack_shephard Sorry ?
rose_nadler Bernard , my husband , his hands swell up whenever we fly .
dr_jack_shephard The altitude .
rose_nadler He started having me hold onto his wedding ring whenever we took a plane trip .
rose_nadler Always wore it around my neck for safe keeping .
rose_nadler Just until we landed .
rose_nadler You know , doctor , you don't have to keep your promise .
dr_jack_shephard Promise ?
rose_nadler The one you gave me on the plane .
rose_nadler The one you made me-to keep me company until my husband got back from the restroom .
rose_nadler I'm letting you off the hook .
dr_jack_shephard Well , you're not going to get rid of me that easily .
dr_jack_shephard Rose , you shouldn't be out here alone .
dr_jack_shephard You're suffering from Post Traumatic Shock .
rose_nadler Aren't we all ?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , I guess we are .
rose_nadler You have a nice way about you .
rose_nadler A good soul , patient , caring .
rose_nadler I suppose that's why you became a doctor .
dr_jack_shephard Thanks but
dr_jack_shephard I was just kind of born into it .
dr_jack_shephard Family business .
john_locke I have never felt so alive .
john_locke Getting to finally tell Randy off was ... life changing .
john_locke I mean it , now I'm free to do all those things I ever wanted to do .
john_locke Things that I know I was destined to do , like we talked about Helen .
helen_norwood That's wonderful John .
helen_norwood I'm happy for you , really .
john_locke I haven't even told you the best part .
john_locke You remember the authentic aboriginal Walkabout ?
helen_norwood Sure .
helen_norwood That's all you've talked about for weeks .
john_locke Yeah , well , I'm going to do it .
john_locke I'm flying to Australia at the end of the week .
john_locke And I've , uh .
john_locke I bought two tickets .
john_locke Helen ?
helen_norwood John , we've talked about this .
helen_norwood I like you
helen_norwood and I've enjoyed talking with you these past few months .
john_locke 8 months .
helen_norwood I'm not allowed to meet customers .
john_locke Customer ?
john_locke Is that what I am to you ?
helen_norwood This isn't really normal .
helen_norwood I mean , it isn't what I do .
helen_norwood I don't know , maybe you should find a ...
helen_norwood I don't know ...
helen_norwood a therapist ?
john_locke I have a therapist .
helen_norwood John .
john_locke I thought you understood Helen .
john_locke You know me better than anyone .
helen_norwood John , if we talk any longer , I'm going to have to charge you for another hour .
helen_norwood That's another 89.95 and ...
john_locke Look , I don't care about the money .
john_locke I just ...
helen_norwood I'm sorry
helen_norwood John , I've got to go .
john_locke Helen , Helen .
john_locke Helen !
kate_austen Hey , hey wait a minute .
kate_austen Rest here for a minute .
michael_dawson I thought the guy with the gimpy leg should be deciding when we rest .
michael_dawson What are you doing ?
kate_austen Trying to boost the transceiver signal .
kate_austen I'm going to climb this tree and attach the antenna .
michael_dawson You're going to climb that ?
kate_austen Yeah .
kate_austen Don't worry .
kate_austen I've climbed a lot worse .
kate_austen Locke .
james_ford Hey , uh ...
claire_littleton Hey .
james_ford These were , um .
james_ford I found these the other day when I was ...
james_ford Aw hell , just , just take it .
claire_littleton Thank you .
walt_lloyd What is that ?
walt_lloyd Oh , I get it .
walt_lloyd It's like toothpaste .
walt_lloyd Chia ?
walt_lloyd Dad !
hugo_reyes So , like , what happened out there ?
walt_lloyd Dad !
michael_dawson Hey , hey !
walt_lloyd Your leg's all messed up .
walt_lloyd Does it hurt ?
michael_dawson It's okay .
michael_dawson It's not as bad as it looks .
james_ford The mighty huntress returns .
james_ford What's for dinner , hon-
kate_austen Not now .
walt_lloyd So , it was like a boar fight ?
michael_dawson Not too much of a fight .
michael_dawson It was more like me getting gored .
walt_lloyd So , um , where's Mr .
walt_lloyd Locke ?
boone_carlyle I don't think that hunt went very well .
boone_carlyle The bald guy never came back .
shannon_rutherford Wait , they didn't bring back any food at all ?
boone_carlyle Did you hear what I just said ?
boone_carlyle Somebody might have died out there .
shannon_rutherford Well , we're all going to die if somebody doesn't do something .
charlie_pace There you are .
charlie_pace As promised , you and I will be dining of fresh catch of the day .
shannon_rutherford Oh , my fish !
charlie_pace I hope you don't mind al fresco .
charlie_pace It was no problem .
charlie_pace You know what , that one actually gave me a hell of a tussle , but you have to get inside the mind of the fish , you know .
boone_carlyle I don't believe you .
charlie_pace I got it in the shallows , I cornered it .
shannon_rutherford What's the matter ?
shannon_rutherford Can't stand to see me fending for myself ?
boone_carlyle I'm sorry about this , seriously .
charlie_pace No , no , it's okay .
shannon_rutherford What are you apologizing to him for ?
boone_carlyle For you .
boone_carlyle For using him-using this poor guy like you use everyone else .
shannon_rutherford Oh , whatever .
boone_carlyle Somewhere in that twisted little brain , you think this proves that you can take care of yourself .
shannon_rutherford I told you I'd catch a fish , didn't I ?
boone_carlyle That's low Shannon , even for you .
shannon_rutherford Oh , go rescue a baby bird or something .
dr_jack_shephard Rose , after the sun goes down , we're going to burn the fuselage .
dr_jack_shephard It's just something that we have to do .
dr_jack_shephard There's going to be a memorial service back at the camp for those-for those who didn't make it .
dr_jack_shephard For everyone to say goodbye .
rose_nadler I'd like to be there for that .
dr_jack_shephard Okay . .
dr_jack_shephard Maybe if you'd like to say something , you know , about your husband .
rose_nadler What ?
dr_jack_shephard I'm just saying if you wanted to say goodbye to Bernard .
rose_nadler Doctor , my husband is not dead .
dr_jack_shephard Rose , he was in the tail section of the plane .
dr_jack_shephard It broke off in mid-flight .
dr_jack_shephard I'm sorry , but everyone who was in the rear of the plane's gone .
rose_nadler They're probably thinking the same thing about us .
rose_nadler Doctor ?
rose_nadler You coming ?
kate_austen I'm sorry .
kate_austen I guess I should've gotten a warranty .
sayid_jarrah I suppose I'll just try again .
sayid_jarrah Of course , I have no welding iron , no rivets , scorched wiring .
sayid_jarrah And it seems I must continue to lie to anyone who asks me what it is I'm actually doing .
kate_austen Sayid , I'll try it again .
sayid_jarrah We'll try it again .
dr_jack_shephard Kate .
sayid_jarrah Excuse me .
kate_austen Hey .
dr_jack_shephard You
dr_jack_shephard okay ?
kate_austen Is this when you say " I told you so? "
dr_jack_shephard No , I'm not big on rubbing it in .
kate_austen Locke , um .
kate_austen Locke's gone .
kate_austen That thing , it was moving in his direction .
kate_austen There wasn't time .
kate_austen What's going on ?
dr_jack_shephard The fuselage is ready to go .
dr_jack_shephard Some of the others decided , um ...
dr_jack_shephard I guess there's going to be some words
dr_jack_shephard said over the fire ...
kate_austen That's good .
dr_jack_shephard ...
dr_jack_shephard names read , I think .
kate_austen I just don't think they're ready to hear about some of the things that we've ...
kate_austen Jack ?
kate_austen Jack ?
dr_jack_shephard Locke .
claire_littleton Judith Martha Wexler from Denton , TX , guess she was going to catch a connecting flight .

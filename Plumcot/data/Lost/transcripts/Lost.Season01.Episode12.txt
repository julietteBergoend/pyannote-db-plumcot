sayid_jarrah Everything is getting washed out to sea .
sayid_jarrah This can't be normal .
sayid_jarrah The tide shifting so suddenly , rising in so short a time .
dr_jack_shephard There's a lot not normal around here .
dr_jack_shephard At the rate this beach is eroding this fuselage is going to be underwater in a matter of days .
dr_jack_shephard We need to get all this stuff off the beach before nightfall .
sayid_jarrah I just hope that moving up the coast will make a difference .
dr_jack_shephard It would make a difference if everyone moved inland .
sayid_jarrah I think you'll find people slightly wary of entering the jungle after what happened to the pregnant girl .
sayid_jarrah Not to mention whatever that thing is .
dr_jack_shephard Sayid , I need you to take me back to the French woman , Rousseau .
dr_jack_shephard Claire's still out there .
dr_jack_shephard Now , Rousseau mentioned that there are others on this Island .
sayid_jarrah Her mind is gone .
dr_jack_shephard You heard them yourself .
sayid_jarrah I don't know what I heard .
dr_jack_shephard You said that when you ...
sayid_jarrah The wind , Jack .
sayid_jarrah It was the wind playing tricks .
dr_jack_shephard Okay , then , what about the papers that you took from her -- the documents , the maps .
dr_jack_shephard I mean , isn't there anything here
dr_jack_shephard that . .
dr_jack_shephard .
sayid_jarrah I'm skilled at mathematics and decryption , but these equations are beyond anything I've ever seen .
sayid_jarrah There are these notes in French accompanying some of the maps and diagrams .
sayid_jarrah If I could translate them I might be able to make sense of it , but . . .
dr_jack_shephard What ?
sayid_jarrah Perhaps some things are best left untranslated .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah ?
dr_jack_shephard Maybe you should tell him that .
boone_carlyle Glad to see you're doing something productive with your time .
shannon_rutherford Where have you been ?
boone_carlyle What do you mean where have I been ?
shannon_rutherford You and Locke have been leaving before sunrise and coming back after dark for the last 4 days .
shannon_rutherford What are you doing out there ?
shannon_rutherford Is he your new boyfriend ?
boone_carlyle We're looking for Claire .
shannon_rutherford I thought there was no trail anymore -- that no one even knew where to look .
boone_carlyle Yeah , well , at least I'm doing something .
boone_carlyle Don't you see the way they look at us around here ?
boone_carlyle They don't take us seriously .
boone_carlyle We're a joke .
boone_carlyle I'm trying to contribute something .
boone_carlyle You're just -- you're useless .

james_ford But I think you're the one on top .
james_ford Maybe you're not here for the case at all .
james_ford Ow , woman .
james_ford If you wanted to play rough , all you had to do was say so .
james_ford You want to try for it again ?
kate_austen Give it to me .
james_ford No .
sayid_jarrah We're quite close to the equator .
sayid_jarrah The sun might be stronger than what you're used to .
shannon_rutherford I have a pretty good base .
sayid_jarrah There was a matter I was going to ask you about .
shannon_rutherford What ?
sayid_jarrah I need a favor .
sayid_jarrah I need your help translating some papers I took from Rousseau .
shannon_rutherford Who's Rousseau ?
sayid_jarrah The French woman -- the distress call we intercepted .
shannon_rutherford Did my brother put you up to this ?
sayid_jarrah Your brother ?
sayid_jarrah No .
sayid_jarrah The papers contain equations accompanied by notations in French .
sayid_jarrah If I could understand the notations , then-
shannon_rutherford Sorry , can't do it .
sayid_jarrah You're the only person on this Island who speaks French .
shannon_rutherford I barely speak French .
sayid_jarrah Please , Shannon , can you at least try ?
james_ford Son of a bitch !
michael_dawson You're wasting your time , man .
michael_dawson If you pick the lock on a Halliburton , I'll put you on my back and fly us to LA .
james_ford You better find yourself a runway , daddy , cuz there ain't a lock I can't pick .
hugo_reyes What's he trying to do ?
michael_dawson Pick the lock on a Halliburton .
hugo_reyes Good luck .
michael_dawson The only way you're going to open that case is with pure force , man .
michael_dawson Impact velocity .
james_ford What the hell is that supposed to mean ?
michael_dawson You've got to hit it with something hard , like a sledgehammer .
michael_dawson Or the axe .
john_locke You got it ?
boone_carlyle Yeah .
boone_carlyle Right there .
boone_carlyle Isn't there any easier way to get there ?
john_locke The easiest way isn't always the best .

boone_carlyle No , I don't think so .
john_locke Well , which is it ?
boone_carlyle Sorry ?

shannon_rutherford You never said anything about math .
sayid_jarrah You worry about the French , I'll take care of the math .
shannon_rutherford I can't do this .
sayid_jarrah If you really put your mind to it , I know you can , Shannon .
sayid_jarrah Where did you learn to speak French ?
shannon_rutherford I knew this guy .
sayid_jarrah This guy ?
shannon_rutherford In France , in Saint Tropez .
shannon_rutherford I kind of lived there for a while .
sayid_jarrah Well , they say that is the best way to learn a foreign language .
shannon_rutherford Alright .

dr_jack_shephard A headache ?
dr_jack_shephard Oh , cool , alright .

kate_austen We got a problem .
dr_jack_shephard We have a problem ?
dr_jack_shephard Or , you have a problem ?
kate_austen Jack , you're the only one who knows about me .
kate_austen Before I left the city , the Marshal who was escorting me , he had this silver case .
kate_austen The airline wouldn't let him bring the case on the plane .
kate_austen It was hard enough trying to convince them to let him wear a gun on his ankle .
kate_austen But the case , they made him check it .
dr_jack_shephard What was in the case ?
kate_austen Some traveling money , some of his personal stuff .
kate_austen And 4 nine millimeters with a few boxes of ammo .
dr_jack_shephard Guns ?
kate_austen Guns .
dr_jack_shephard So , where is the case now ?
kate_austen Sawyer has it .
dr_jack_shephard Aha .
kate_austen He hasn't been able to open it .
dr_jack_shephard Lucky for us .
kate_austen He will .
kate_austen Sooner or later .
dr_jack_shephard So , what do you need me to do ?
kate_austen I know where the key is .
kate_austen The Marshal , he kept it in his wallet .
kate_austen In his back pocket .
dr_jack_shephard I buried him , Kate .
kate_austen I know .
kate_austen Where ?
dr_jack_shephard So , what else is in the case ?
kate_austen What ?
dr_jack_shephard What else is in the case , Kate ?
kate_austen Nothing .
dr_jack_shephard That's the truth ?
kate_austen Just the guns .
dr_jack_shephard If you want my help , we're going to open the case together .
kate_austen Okay .
dr_jack_shephard Okay .
charlie_pace Why are you smiling ?
rose_nadler Am I ?
charlie_pace You look -- happy .
rose_nadler Well , I guess I must be then .
charlie_pace There's no reason to be happy , things are awful .
rose_nadler They're not that awful .
charlie_pace We're stranded on an Island .
charlie_pace No one's coming for us .
rose_nadler You don't know that .
charlie_pace Well , what I do know , is there's something in that jungle that eats people .
charlie_pace Just because we haven't heard from it in a couple of weeks doesn't mean it won't get hungry again .
charlie_pace And I know there's a person , or people , that are trying to hurt us ...
rose_nadler Charlie .
rose_nadler Nobody blames you .
charlie_pace What ?
rose_nadler For what happened to Claire .
rose_nadler It's not your fault .
rose_nadler You did everything that you could do .
rose_nadler And you came very close to dying yourself .
charlie_pace Maybe I should have died .
rose_nadler You know what I think , Charlie ?
rose_nadler You need to ask for help .
charlie_pace Who's going to help me ?
kate_austen So , why didn't you put him with the others , when you burned the fuselage ?
dr_jack_shephard Because I needed to bury him .
kate_austen So you ready to do this ?
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Hell , yeah , by now their imaginations are running wild .

JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Okay , hero .
kate_austen No , please don't .
kate_austen I've got ...
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Shut up .
ROBBER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Everybody just relax .
ROBBER#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 I said quiet .
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Okay , Mr . Manager , you want to be a hard-ass ?
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Protect a vault that doesn't even belong to you ?
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Okay ?
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 There's going to be consequences .
kate_austen He's going to kill me anyway .
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 I said ... if you don't shut up !
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 You've got 3 seconds to give me that damn key .
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 1 , 2 , , 3 .

dr_jack_shephard Did you get it ?
kate_austen Yeah .
dr_jack_shephard Key isn't in here .
kate_austen It isn't ?
dr_jack_shephard No , but that was real good sleight-of-hand distracting me with the wallet .
dr_jack_shephard Open it .
kate_austen Jack , I ...
dr_jack_shephard Don't .
dr_jack_shephard Don't .
shannon_rutherford A des reflets d'argent .
shannon_rutherford La mer des reflets changeants -- the sea of sparkles ?
shannon_rutherford No , wait , um , the sea of silver sparkles that change .
shannon_rutherford It's the same as the last one .
sayid_jarrah Are you sure ?
sayid_jarrah But the equation is completely different .
sayid_jarrah It doesn't relate .
sayid_jarrah What you're saying doesn't make any sense .
shannon_rutherford Okay ?
sayid_jarrah What about this one ?
sayid_jarrah It should say something about latitude or longitude , something about the stars ...
shannon_rutherford Okay , just give me some room , okay ?
shannon_rutherford Um , next to the pond , blue , um , blue eternity , blue eternity ?
shannon_rutherford No , wait , no , blue infinity .
sayid_jarrah Blue infinity ?
shannon_rutherford Blue infinity .
shannon_rutherford There's something about this that is so familiar .
sayid_jarrah You've been telling me what sounds very much like nonsense for the past hour
sayid_jarrah and now it seems to me ...
shannon_rutherford Okay , a)
shannon_rutherford I told you that my French sucks , and b) this isn't my nonsense
shannon_rutherford , okay ?
shannon_rutherford Did you ever think that after 16 years on Mystery Frickin' Island your friend might not be quite adjusted ?
sayid_jarrah This was a mistake .
shannon_rutherford Yeah , haven't you heard ?
shannon_rutherford I'm completely useless .
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer .
james_ford Doctor ?
james_ford What can I do you for ?
james_ford Figured
james_ford she'd get you to do her dirty work for her .
james_ford So what ?
james_ford Are we going to wrestle for it ?
dr_jack_shephard No , you're going to give it to me .
james_ford Am I ?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
james_ford I'm just going to give it to you ?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
james_ford Why would I want to do that ?
dr_jack_shephard Cephalexin .
james_ford Yeah , go on ?
dr_jack_shephard That's the antibiotic I've been giving you for the knife wound in your arm .
dr_jack_shephard You're right in the middle of the treatment cycle now , if I keep giving you the pills you're going to be as right as rain .
dr_jack_shephard But I'm going to stop giving you the pills .
dr_jack_shephard And for 2 days you're going to think you're all good , then it's going to start to itch .
dr_jack_shephard The day after that the fever's going to come
dr_jack_shephard and you're going to start seeing red lines running up and down your arm .
dr_jack_shephard A day or two after that you'll beg me to take the case , just to cut off your arm .
james_ford That's a nice story , Jack .
james_ford And , even if it were true , I don't think you could do it .
dr_jack_shephard You're wrong .
james_ford Did she tell you what's inside ?
james_ford Yeah , me neither .
james_ford Hope you got yourself some jaws-of-life back in cave-town , that's what it's going to take to pop this bitch .
dr_jack_shephard I'll figure something out .
james_ford I know you think you're doing her a favor .
james_ford But however she talked you into doing this , she lied , brother .
kate_austen Jack ?
dr_jack_shephard We're going to do this together .
kate_austen Why ?
dr_jack_shephard Because that's what I said we'd do .
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 What the hell you waiting for ?

JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 The girl picked this bank , picked this vault .
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 This whole thing is the girl's idea .

hutton You need 2 keys .
hutton The bank's ,
hutton and ... If you had the customer key , why would you need ...

JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 I swear to god , you better kill me , Maggie .
JASON#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode12 Because if you don't ...

shannon_rutherford The guy from Saint Tropez , he had this kid , a real snot , who hated me .
shannon_rutherford His name was Laurent .
shannon_rutherford He watched this movie over and over and over again , everyday , all day , the way kids do , 900 times .
shannon_rutherford It was the cartoon about fish , you know , one of the computer ones ?
sayid_jarrah Why are you telling me this ?
shannon_rutherford Because the movie was dubbed in French .
shannon_rutherford And at the end there was this song .
shannon_rutherford Those notations , they're song lyrics .
shannon_rutherford And your French woman , she's just like Laurent , because she wrote them over and over and over again .
sayid_jarrah What's the song ?
shannon_rutherford La mer .
shannon_rutherford Qu'on voit danser le long des golfes clairs .
shannon_rutherford A des reflets d'argent .

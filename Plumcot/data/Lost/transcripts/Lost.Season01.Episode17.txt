shannon_rutherford By dating guys with sailboats ?
sayid_jarrah Since you bring it up .
sayid_jarrah I've been worried since I first met you that you might end up being a spinster .
shannon_rutherford Spending my Saturday nights alone at home , tying knots ?
sayid_jarrah Perhaps with an overweight aunt ?
sayid_jarrah It's a very sad image .
shannon_rutherford Maybe we should get some rope , spend a Saturday night alone together , and see what happens .

michael_dawson I needed the halyards for the mast .
james_ford Good thing
james_ford I'm a saver , not a spender , huh , Doc ?

sunhwa_kwon Please ...
kate_austen Sun ...
sunhwa_kwon He's my husband ...
kate_austen Yeah , a husband you're afraid to tell you speak English .
kate_austen I'm trying to understand , Sun .
sunhwa_kwon He wasn't always like this .
sunhwa_kwon He used to tell me how beautiful I looked to him .
sunhwa_kwon He was so tender .
sunhwa_kwon And then he was different .
kate_austen What changed him ?
kate_austen Hey , Charlie , what's going on ?

john_locke Do you like him ?
shannon_rutherford What ?
john_locke Sayid .
shannon_rutherford Are you serious ?
john_locke Because if you do -- like him , what's it got to do with your brother ?
john_locke You're a grown woman .

shannon_rutherford Yeah , what's that ?
john_locke Your attention .
john_locke Everyone gets a new life on this Island , Shannon .

dr_jack_shephard You understood us ?
dr_jack_shephard All this time ?
dr_jack_shephard Why didn't you say anything ?
sunhwa_kwon Your raft was already on fire when he arrived .
sunhwa_kwon He burned his hands trying to put it out .
michael_dawson Then why did he run ?
michael_dawson Exactly , that's what I thought .
sunhwa_kwon My husband is many things .
sunhwa_kwon But he is not a liar .
james_ford You're going to lecture us about lying , Betty ?
james_ford From the look on his face , even your old man here didn't know you speak English .
james_ford How do we know she's not covering for him ?
john_locke Because she's isn't !
john_locke Why would he burn the raft ?
michael_dawson He's been after me since day one , everybody knows it !
michael_dawson What if-
john_locke Okay , it's personal , but why take it out on our best chance of getting off the Island ?
john_locke Why would any one of us block an attempt to get home ?
john_locke We're so intent on pointing the finger at one another that we're ignoring the simple undeniable truth that the problem isn't here , it's there !
john_locke They've attacked us , sabotaged us , abducted us , murdered us !
john_locke Maybe it's time we stop blaming us and start worrying about them !
john_locke We're not the only people on this Island
john_locke and we all know it !
sunhwa_kwon He did not do it .
michael_dawson I can't salvage a thing -- pontoons , the decking .
michael_dawson Fire burned up all the twine !

sunhwa_kwon But you made me change my mind .
sunhwa_kwon You made me think that you still loved me .
sayid_jarrah What was that for ?
shannon_rutherford Everyone gets a new life on this Island .
shannon_rutherford I'd like to start now .
john_locke Got yourself an opponent ?
walt_lloyd Hurley owes me 83,000 dollars .
walt_lloyd I told him I'd give him a chance to win it back .
john_locke It's been awhile since you and I played .
john_locke I don't have 83,000 dollars .

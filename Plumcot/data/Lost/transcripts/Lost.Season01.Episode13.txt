sayid_jarrah I brought you a present for helping me with the translations .
sayid_jarrah I didn't have a chance to get it gift-wrapped , so -- .
sayid_jarrah I found these in the wreckage
sayid_jarrah and I have no use for them personally .
shannon_rutherford They are actually my size .
shannon_rutherford Well , half a size off ,
shannon_rutherford but , I swear this place is actually making my feel swell .
sayid_jarrah Another mysterious force of the Island revealed .
hugo_reyes Yo , Boone .
hugo_reyes Question for you , dude .
boone_carlyle Yeah .
hugo_reyes You and Locke are going out hunting boar everyday , right ?
boone_carlyle What about it ?
hugo_reyes That's cool , except , how come you're not coming back with any ?
hugo_reyes We haven't had fresh pork on a plate in about a week , dude .
boone_carlyle It's not like they're domesticated animals .
hugo_reyes Maybe you guys aren't trying hard enough ?
boone_carlyle We're hunting , alright ?
hugo_reyes I hope so , because people need food , man -- solid food .
hugo_reyes This isn't a game , man .
boone_carlyle I can't believe you ran down that last ball .
boone_carlyle And then you hit it for a winner .
nicole Lucky shot .
boone_carlyle Yeah , I wish it was luck .
boone_carlyle Is that my phone ?
boone_carlyle Yeah , hello .
shannon_rutherford Boone , it's me .
boone_carlyle Shannon ?
shannon_rutherford Yeah ...
boone_carlyle What's the matter ?
shannon_rutherford Um , things aren't so good .
boone_carlyle Where are you ?
shannon_rutherford Get out of here !
shannon_rutherford Get the hell away from me !
boone_carlyle Shannon ?
boone_carlyle Shannon ?
shannon_rutherford Just stay out of here !
shannon_rutherford Get the hell away from me !
boone_carlyle Shannon , what's going on ?
boone_carlyle Alright , Shannon , just hang on , just tell me where you are .
boone_carlyle I'll come get you .
shannon_rutherford Sydney .
boone_carlyle Sydney ?
shannon_rutherford Australia .
boone_carlyle Stay away from my sister .
sayid_jarrah For a moment you seemed to be giving me an order .
boone_carlyle It's just a friendly suggestion .
sayid_jarrah A suggestion ?
boone_carlyle Yes , and if I were you I'd listen .
sayid_jarrah What if I don't ?
john_locke Boone !
john_locke Found some fresh tracks down by the stream .
boone_carlyle See you later .
sayid_jarrah You know where to find me .
john_locke You need to put aside your differences with Sayid .
boone_carlyle He's hitting on Shannon .
john_locke He's very competent .
john_locke We don't want to make an enemy of him .
john_locke We're going to want him on our side .
boone_carlyle John , people are talking about what we're doing out here every day , especially since we never come back with anything .
john_locke You mean boar .
boone_carlyle Yeah .
john_locke Plenty of fruit and fish to go around .
john_locke What we're doing here is far more important .
john_locke Right now , this is our priority .
hugo_reyes So , Jack ?
dr_jack_shephard So , Hurley ?
hugo_reyes Something kind of important
hugo_reyes I'd want to ask you about .
hugo_reyes Um , anything I tell you is doctor-patient confidential , right ?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
hugo_reyes The thing is -- I haven't been feeling so great .
dr_jack_shephard What's the matter ?
hugo_reyes Well , it's kind of like , uh , my stomach .
hugo_reyes I've been having some , um , major digestive issues .
dr_jack_shephard What have you been eating ?
hugo_reyes You know , the usual - bananas , papayas , mangoes , guava , passion fruit , coconut .
hugo_reyes Some of those weird star fruits from up on the hill .
hugo_reyes Someone said they might be good for digestion .
hugo_reyes Let me tell you , they lied .
dr_jack_shephard Well , it might help if you had a little bit more protein in your diet .
hugo_reyes Dude , what can I do ?
hugo_reyes There's no boar .
hugo_reyes No boar , no protein .
dr_jack_shephard You can eat fish .
dr_jack_shephard Jin's been catching a lot of them .
hugo_reyes No way , man .
hugo_reyes That guy has it in for me .
dr_jack_shephard Oh , come on , man .
hugo_reyes I'm not kidding .
hugo_reyes He offered me something to eat , like right after we , you know , got here , um , the thing with the spikes ?
dr_jack_shephard Sea urchin .
hugo_reyes Yeah .
hugo_reyes And when I turned him down it's like I soiled his family honor or something .
hugo_reyes He hasn't looked me in the eye since .
hugo_reyes The guy holds a serious grudge .
dr_jack_shephard You're not eating those , are you ?
hugo_reyes Dude , these aren't for eating .
hugo_reyes Excuse me .
kate_austen I can see you there , you know .
dr_jack_shephard I wasn't hiding , just didn't want to disrupt you from doing whatever it is you're doing .
kate_austen It's not like it's a secret .
dr_jack_shephard Hard to tell with you sometimes .
dr_jack_shephard Huh , gross little , grayish-yellow things .
kate_austen Passion fruit seeds .
dr_jack_shephard What are they for ?
kate_austen I'll show you .
kate_austen If you want to see ?
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
kate_austen Follow me .
dr_jack_shephard Please tell me you found a coffee bar .
kate_austen Not quite .
dr_jack_shephard When did you do all this ?
kate_austen I didn't .
kate_austen It was all Sun .
kate_austen I just wandered into this place the other day when I was out picking fruit .
dr_jack_shephard This is is beautiful .
dr_jack_shephard It's great .
kate_austen She planted some herbs and some low growing stuff here .
kate_austen And then she started a grove over there .
dr_jack_shephard Smart .
dr_jack_shephard With the boar running out we're going to need as much food as we can possibly get .
kate_austen Maybe it's not running out .
dr_jack_shephard What do you mean ?
kate_austen Maybe Locke's just decided not to catch it for us anymore .
dr_jack_shephard Why would he do that ?
kate_austen A lot of mouths to feed .
kate_austen If the boar's thinning out then why should he feed everyone else at his own expense ?
boone_carlyle That glass isn't breaking and the door's sealed shut .
boone_carlyle I think it's cement .
boone_carlyle What is that ?
john_locke Hmmm ?
boone_carlyle The stuff in the bowl - what is that ?
john_locke It's for later .
boone_carlyle So , not to be too difficult , but we've been coming here for two days just staring at this thing .
boone_carlyle I'm not really sure what we're supposed to be doing .
john_locke Ludovico Buonarrati , Michelangelo's father .
john_locke He was a wealthy man .
john_locke He had no understanding of the divinity in his son , so he beat him .
john_locke No child of his was going to use his hands for a living .
john_locke So , Michelangelo learned not to use his hands .
john_locke Years later a visiting prince came into Michelangelo's studio and found the master staring at a single 18 foot block of marble .
john_locke Then he knew that the rumors were true -- that Michelangelo had come in everyday for the last four months , stared at the marble , and gone home for his supper .
john_locke So the prince asked the obvious -- what are you doing ?
john_locke And Michelangelo turned around and looked at him , and whispered , sto lavorando , I'm working .
john_locke Three years later that block of marble was the statue of David .
boone_carlyle We're not going to stare at this for 4 months , are we ?
boone_carlyle How are we going to open it ?
john_locke Well , that's what we have to figure out .
john_locke That's why we're sitting here .
john_locke I mean , how do you open a hatch that has no handle ,
john_locke no latch , no discernible way of opening it ?
bryan Yeah ?
boone_carlyle I'm looking for Shannon .
bryan Who are you ?
boone_carlyle I'm her brother .
shannon_rutherford Boone ?
boone_carlyle What's going on ?
shannon_rutherford What are you doing here ?
boone_carlyle 15 hours .
boone_carlyle I just spent 15 hours on a plane -- happy to see you , glad you're here --
boone_carlyle something like that might work .
shannon_rutherford Listen , this really isn't the best time .
shannon_rutherford Bryan and I were just on our way out to meet some friends .
shannon_rutherford Why don't you give me a call tomorrow ?
shannon_rutherford Please ?
boone_carlyle Okay .
boone_carlyle Enjoy your friends .
hugo_reyes Jin !
hugo_reyes Yo , Jin !
hugo_reyes Alto .
hugo_reyes Listen
hugo_reyes , I know you don't like me because of the sea urchin thing .
hugo_reyes But that's okay because I'm not asking for any favors .
hugo_reyes Just let me know where you get the fish .
hugo_reyes Fish Just point me in the right direction .
hugo_reyes I'll take care of my own business with my own tools .
hugo_reyes You just said something mean , didn't you ?
boone_carlyle You know , we're going to have to tell them .
john_locke Tell them what ?
boone_carlyle What we found .
boone_carlyle You know , they're not going to keep believing that we're coming out here hunting .
boone_carlyle We never go back ...
john_locke They're not ready .
john_locke They won't understand it .
boone_carlyle I don't think I understand it .
john_locke That's the problem .
boone_carlyle Look , at least I've got to tell Shannon .
john_locke Why ?
boone_carlyle What do mean , why ?
boone_carlyle Because she's my sister .
john_locke Why do you care about her so much ?
boone_carlyle You don't know her , man .
boone_carlyle She's smart
boone_carlyle , she's special in a lot of ways .
john_locke Fair enough .
boone_carlyle She's been asking me about this .
boone_carlyle I can't keep lying to her .
john_locke You mean you can't keep lying to her , or you can't stand the way she makes you feel because you're lying to her ?
boone_carlyle Both .
boone_carlyle Whatever .
boone_carlyle Look , she can keep a secret .
john_locke You're sure ?
boone_carlyle Yes , I'm sure .
john_locke No , I mean , are you sure you want to do this ?
boone_carlyle I've got to get her off my back .
boone_carlyle She keeps asking me about this , she keeps asking me about you , about the whole thing .
john_locke You're sure you've thought through the ramifications ?
boone_carlyle Yes .
john_locke So be it .
boone_carlyle Locke , what is this ?
boone_carlyle Do you hear me ?
boone_carlyle Untie me right now .
john_locke Or what ?
boone_carlyle I swear I won't tell anyone about the hatch thing ,
boone_carlyle okay ?
boone_carlyle I promise .
john_locke I'm doing this , Boone , because it's time for you to let go of some things .
john_locke Because it's what's best for you .
john_locke And , I promise , you're going to thank me for this later .
boone_carlyle Hey , I don't think this is best for me
boone_carlyle What is that? !
john_locke An untreated wound , out here , is going to get infected .
boone_carlyle You're not going to just leave me here !
john_locke Whether you stay is up to you .
john_locke The camp is 4 miles due west .
boone_carlyle Which way is west ?
john_locke You'll be able to cut yourself free once you have the proper motivation .
boone_carlyle Locke !
boone_carlyle Help , help !
malcolm I'm sorry , Mr . Carlyle , but I'm afraid I can't help you .
malcolm Unfortunately , sir , we'll need a little more to go on .
boone_carlyle I don't understand this , I'm reporting a crime .
james_ford I'm sitting in this ...
james_ford little bar , minding my own business .
james_ford And this guy ...
boone_carlyle Look , this is a cycle with her , okay .
boone_carlyle My sister just happens to be attracted to the wrong kind of guy .
james_ford I just gave it back to him .
james_ford Hey , yo , croc hunter , how come nobody wants to hear my side of the story , huh? !
james_ford Just what kind of ...
malcolm Now , if that were her mate , see , then I could help you .
malcolm Let's finish taking down the rest of your information .
malcolm You were saying she's your sister , then why is her name Rutherford , and yours Carlyle ?
malcolm Is she married ?
boone_carlyle She was married .
boone_carlyle She's not married anymore , and that has nothing to do with this .
boone_carlyle Rutherford is her father's name .
boone_carlyle Our parents got married when I was 10 , she was 8 .
malcolm So she's your step-sister ?
boone_carlyle That's right .
malcolm No blood relation .
boone_carlyle Maybe you've heard of my mother , Sabrina Carlyle ?
boone_carlyle She owns the largest wedding business in the United States .
boone_carlyle I'm the COO of the wedding clothing subsidiary .
malcolm Would you like to buy my wife's wedding dress ?
malcolm Cost $2000 new .
malcolm It's only been worn once .
boone_carlyle I just want someone to go pay this guy a visit , that's all .
malcolm Mr .
malcolm Carlyle , in the absence of any physical evidence or a direct complaint from , uh ...
boone_carlyle Shannon .
malcolm Shannon .
malcolm We can't just go barging into people's apartments .
malcolm Sadly , we're the police , not the dating police .
boone_carlyle Bryan , we need to talk .
bryan Yeah ?
boone_carlyle I'm not going to waste your time , and I'm not going to waste mine .
boone_carlyle I want you to break up with my sister .
bryan What ?
boone_carlyle I want you to end it .
boone_carlyle Today .
boone_carlyle Right now .
bryan Oh , bugger off , mate .
boone_carlyle What you don't understand , Bryan , is that you'll be the third guy I've paid to leave .
boone_carlyle Go to her house when she's not there , pack your stuff , and never have contact with her again .
boone_carlyle Understood ?
bryan So you flew all the way over here to bribe me .
boone_carlyle I'm going to give you 25,000 US dollars .
bryan I love her .
boone_carlyle How much ?
bryan My love for her -- is worth closer to 50,000 .
kate_austen I can't believe we've been here for over 3 weeks .
kate_austen I was on my way to Bali .
kate_austen I travel a lot .
kate_austen I was looking forward to exploring the Island .
kate_austen Somehow I ended up on a flight to LA , instead .
kate_austen Guess that falls under the category -- be careful what you wish for .
kate_austen You understood me .
kate_austen You did , didn't you
kate_austen , you just understood what I said ?
kate_austen You speak English ?
sunhwa_kwon Please , don't tell anyone .
hugo_reyes Damn it !
hugo_reyes You know what ?
hugo_reyes Fine .
hugo_reyes You win , okay ?
hugo_reyes You happy now ?
hugo_reyes Keep your damn fish , I'm out of here .
hugo_reyes Ow !
hugo_reyes Ow , ow , ow !
hugo_reyes I stepped in a friggin' urchin !
hugo_reyes Ow , you understand me? !
hugo_reyes Do you understand infection , gangrene , amputation? !
hugo_reyes Ow , aw , ow !
hugo_reyes You've got to do something for me .
hugo_reyes You're going to have to pee on my foot , man .
hugo_reyes It'll stop the venom .
hugo_reyes I saw it on TV .
hugo_reyes Ow , arrgh , no just pee on it man .
hugo_reyes You need to pee , pee on it .
hugo_reyes Pee on my foot .
hugo_reyes I'll lose my foot if you don't .
hugo_reyes Just pee !
hugo_reyes Pee on it !
hugo_reyes Pee on-
john_locke Hi .
sayid_jarrah I didn't hear you .
john_locke Sorry .
john_locke Sneakier than I give myself credit for .
sayid_jarrah What are you doing out here ?
john_locke We were hunting .
john_locke Boone thought I should take the afternoon off .
sayid_jarrah Boone -- is hunting ?
john_locke The boy's eager to learn .
sayid_jarrah You think he'll catch anything ?
john_locke Nope .
john_locke What are you doing out here , Sayid ?
sayid_jarrah Orienteering .
sayid_jarrah I'm trying to make something of Rousseau's maps ,
sayid_jarrah but ...
john_locke There's nothing to make .
sayid_jarrah Exactly .
john_locke Well , you made a compass .
john_locke I haven't seen one of those since I was a Webelos .
sayid_jarrah What's a Webelos ?
john_locke It's half way between a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout .
sayid_jarrah And what does a Webelos do ?
john_locke Gets badges , mostly .
john_locke Ties knots , identifies birds .
john_locke I wasn't the most popular kid .
john_locke I'll leave you to it .
john_locke Maybe this will help your cause .
sayid_jarrah Don't you need this ?
john_locke Not anymore .
shannon_rutherford Somebody help me !
boone_carlyle Who's that? !
shannon_rutherford Boone !
boone_carlyle Shannon !
boone_carlyle I'm tied up !
shannon_rutherford What? !
boone_carlyle Can you get over here? !
shannon_rutherford I'm tied up , too !

boone_carlyle Go .
boone_carlyle Come on .
boone_carlyle In here , in here .
sayid_jarrah Let me ask you something -- which way do you think North is ?
dr_jack_shephard Sorry ?
sayid_jarrah North ?
sayid_jarrah Which way is it ?
dr_jack_shephard Uh , okay .
dr_jack_shephard The sun's going to set over there , so that makes that West .
dr_jack_shephard That'd be North .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah .
sayid_jarrah Correct .
sayid_jarrah That's where North should be .
sayid_jarrah Yet that is North .
dr_jack_shephard I'm not ...
sayid_jarrah A minor magnetic anomaly might explain a variance of 2 or 3 degrees , but not this .
dr_jack_shephard What are you saying ?
sayid_jarrah I'm saying this compass is obviously defective .
dr_jack_shephard Where'd you get it ?
sayid_jarrah Locke gave it to me this afternoon .
dr_jack_shephard Locke ?
dr_jack_shephard Where'd you see Locke ?
sayid_jarrah About a mile East of here , walking through the jungle .
sayid_jarrah At least I think it's East .
shannon_rutherford What did you do to him ?
boone_carlyle What did I do to who ?
shannon_rutherford Locke .
shannon_rutherford What did you do to that psycho to piss him off ?
boone_carlyle I didn't do anything to him .
shannon_rutherford What ?
shannon_rutherford He just did it because he was bored ?
shannon_rutherford Look , I know you guys are ...
boone_carlyle Let's go back to camp .
shannon_rutherford You were supposed to come later .
boone_carlyle Do you have any bags ?
boone_carlyle Anything you want to take ?
shannon_rutherford You should go back .
boone_carlyle No , Shannon .
boone_carlyle We're getting out of this country .
boone_carlyle Is there anything you want to bring with you ?
boone_carlyle What's the matter with you ?
bryan Aw , look at this .
boone_carlyle Let's go , please .
boone_carlyle C'mon .
boone_carlyle We can go .
bryan Hey , mate , you don't get this yet , do you --
bryan what's what ?
boone_carlyle You set me up .
boone_carlyle This whole thing was a set up .
bryan She's just getting what she's owed .
boone_carlyle What'd you say ?
bryan She told me your mum screwed Shannon over after her daddy died , kept all her father's money for herself .
bryan A sweet mum you got there .
boone_carlyle This isn't the first time , is it ?
boone_carlyle Oh , you've done this before , you little bitch .
bryan That's enough .
boone_carlyle Don't touch me
boone_carlyle you low life piece
boone_carlyle of-
shannon_rutherford Bryan , get off of him !
shannon_rutherford Get off of him !
shannon_rutherford Get off! !
dr_jack_shephard Any ships ?
john_locke Not yet .
john_locke But I'm -- patient .
dr_jack_shephard Mind if I join you ?
dr_jack_shephard It's been awhile since you and I talked , John .
john_locke Well , you're a busy man .
dr_jack_shephard So are you .
dr_jack_shephard Where's Boone ?
john_locke I haven't seen him today .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah ?
dr_jack_shephard You two have been attached at the hip all week .
john_locke Well , let me just check my hip ...
john_locke Nope , no Boone .
dr_jack_shephard How's the boar hunting going ?
john_locke Between you and me ?
dr_jack_shephard Always .
john_locke I'm afraid they're beginning to migrate outside our valley .
john_locke They're smart animals , and smart animals adapt quickly when a new predator is introduced into their environment .
dr_jack_shephard You mean us ?
john_locke The most dangerous predator of all .
kate_austen Does anybody else know ?
sunhwa_kwon Only Michael .
kate_austen But not your husband ?
sunhwa_kwon Please , I ...
kate_austen Don't worry .
kate_austen I can keep a secret .
sunhwa_kwon I took English lessons in Korea .
sunhwa_kwon He doesn't know -- it's complicated .
kate_austen So why don't you tell him now ?
sunhwa_kwon I can't .
kate_austen Why ?
sunhwa_kwon Because I love him .
kate_austen I don't ...
sunhwa_kwon Have you never lied to a man you've loved ?
hugo_reyes You sure you don't speak English ?
hugo_reyes Cuz there's a rumor that you do .
hugo_reyes --
hugo_reyes Your wife's hot .
hugo_reyes Oh , I get it , this is some kind of payback because I wouldn't eat the urchin the other time ?
hugo_reyes I eat this
hugo_reyes you give me a fish , right ?
hugo_reyes Okay , fine .
hugo_reyes Over the lips and past the gums , yada yada , oh god .
charlie_pace Cheers .
dr_jack_shephard You need a hand ?
charlie_pace Yeah ,
charlie_pace yeah ,
charlie_pace I'd love one .
dr_jack_shephard Haven't seen you around the caves lately .
charlie_pace I needed a change of scenery .
dr_jack_shephard How are you doing , Charlie ?
charlie_pace How am I doing ?
charlie_pace With week 2 of heroin withdrawal ?
charlie_pace Or how am I doing with Claire being abducted by the freak who tried to kill me ?
dr_jack_shephard I gave you the aspirin for the heroin withdrawal .
dr_jack_shephard What do you think his story is ?
charlie_pace Who ?
charlie_pace Locke ?
charlie_pace The guy's a freak of nature .
charlie_pace Highly disturbed .
charlie_pace Chances are he probably killed all his mates at the post office the day his mum forgot to put a cookie in his lunch tin .
charlie_pace That was my first impression , anyway .
charlie_pace And then he saved my life .
dr_jack_shephard So you trust him ?
charlie_pace Trust him ?
charlie_pace No offense , mate , but if there's one person on this Island I would put my absolute faith in to save us all it would be John Locke .
walt_lloyd C'mon , you want the ball ?
walt_lloyd Go get the ball .
walt_lloyd Go get the ball .
walt_lloyd Good boy .
hugo_reyes Dude , did you find your own bag ?
hugo_reyes That's awesome , man .
michael_dawson Yeah .
walt_lloyd Come on , Vincent , over here .
hugo_reyes Be nice to get to use your own toothbrush again .
michael_dawson Got some papaya there , huh ?
hugo_reyes Yeah .
hugo_reyes Yippee .
michael_dawson Hey , you mind if I , uh ... ?
hugo_reyes Knock yourself out .
hugo_reyes You want to wish something on your worst enemy ?
hugo_reyes Hope they step on a sea urchin .
hugo_reyes Oh hey , thanks .
hugo_reyes Dude , has this thing already been cleaned ?
hugo_reyes Are you kidding me ?
dr_jack_shephard They look happy .
kate_austen Happy ?
dr_jack_shephard Put out your hand .
dr_jack_shephard You'll like it , I swear .
kate_austen Gross little grayish-yellow thingies ?
dr_jack_shephard Oh , no , no , no , these are slimy little bluish-black thingies .
kate_austen Guava seeds .
dr_jack_shephard What's a garden without guava ?
shannon_rutherford Are you sure we're going in the right direction ?
boone_carlyle If you don't want to follow me , don't .
shannon_rutherford I wouldn't have to follow you if you weren't best friends with the nut case who brought us out here .
shannon_rutherford You and Locke weren't hunting , were you ?
shannon_rutherford You were doing something else .
boone_carlyle Haven't we been over this before ?
shannon_rutherford You're a horrible liar , Boone .
boone_carlyle We weren't doing anything .
shannon_rutherford Why are you keeping secrets for this guy ?
boone_carlyle Do you know who this guy is ?
boone_carlyle He's the only one here that has a clue to what's going on .
shannon_rutherford What is that supposed to mean ?
boone_carlyle It means he's smart .
shannon_rutherford He tied us up , Boone .
shannon_rutherford Why ?
boone_carlyle We found something .
shannon_rutherford What ?
boone_carlyle While we were out looking for Claire we found this -- this piece of metal buried in the jungle .
boone_carlyle We've been excavating it .
boone_carlyle That's what we've been doing .
shannon_rutherford A piece of metal ?
boone_carlyle A hatch , buried in the dirt .
shannon_rutherford Like a door ?
boone_carlyle Yes , Shannon , that's what a hatch is .
shannon_rutherford Where does it go ?
boone_carlyle I don't know .
boone_carlyle But I told him I wanted to tell you , and that's when he did this .
boone_carlyle C'mon .
boone_carlyle No , Shannon !
boone_carlyle Shannon !
boone_carlyle Shannon !
boone_carlyle What do you want ?
shannon_rutherford Bryan took the money .
shannon_rutherford He's gone .
boone_carlyle So the player got played .

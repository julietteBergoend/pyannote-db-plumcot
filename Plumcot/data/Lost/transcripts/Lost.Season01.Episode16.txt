MARY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode16 Stop it! Please stop it! Go away! Stop it!
MARY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode16 What the hell is wrong with you?! I'm calling the police, get out of here. What are you doing? What the hell are you doing with a gun, get out of...
sayid_jarrah Boar took your tarp?
james_ford It was dark, but yeah, I'm pretty sure it was a boar.
sayid_jarrah I thought the boar had vacated this area?
james_ford Well, genius, I think we got some bad info.
sayid_jarrah What was he doing inside your tent?
james_ford It was staring at me. Then it came at me, so I hit it, and it ran off into the jungle.
sayid_jarrah With you tarp? Perhaps he wanted to go camping?
james_ford You enjoying yourself?
sayid_jarrah Yes.
james_ford Well, laugh it up, Mohammad. But I come back and find my stuff's gone, I'm coming after you. Sayid, what did you hear? After you ran into the French woman you said you heard something in the jungle.
sayid_jarrah I was injured and I was exhausted, my mind was playing tricks.
james_ford What did you hear?
sayid_jarrah I thought I heard whispering.
james_ford What was it saying?
sayid_jarrah Why? Did you hear something?
james_ford Forget it. I didn't hear anything.
MARY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode16 JO What are you so afraid of?
james_ford I'm not the one trembling, sweetness.
hibbs Okay, this is really awkward, but if I don't say something now, things are liable to get downright embarrassing.
james_ford Hibbs.
hibbs Hello, Sawyer. Ma'am, I must apologize. I -- I figured my good friend Sawyer here would be alone. I just need a few minutes.
james_ford Listen, baby...
MARY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode16 JO Baby, who is this?
james_ford Listen, go down to the bar, get a drink...
MARY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode16 JO No, I don't want to leave you here.
james_ford As soon as I get rid of him, then I'll come get you and I'll explain everything.
MARY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode16 JO But, I...
james_ford Listen, just trust me on this. I will find you, I promise. I promise.
hibbs I've got to hand it to you, Sawbucks. How you find women that beautiful to work your grift.
james_ford Now, if I'm not mistaken, I'm fairly certain I said I'd kill you if I ever saw you again.
hibbs That's why I'm here, to make things right. Besides, we both know you ain't the killing type. Here. I figure that makes us even for the Tampa job.
james_ford What could possibly make us even for the Tampa job?
hibbs How about the known whereabouts of the man who ruined your life? I'm going to make myself a drink. You want one? You remember old man Parks, right? Ran capper for us on that gig in Atlanta.
james_ford Yeah, what about him?
hibbs He's been working the wire at an off track parlor down in Sydney. So, last week one of his regulars gets a little too sauced, starts running his mouth off about his glory days as a grifter. That guy, Frank Duckett. Real hard luck case - gambling addict, alcoholic, runs a shrimp truck. Back in the day this guy Duckett was quite the hustler. He ran the romance angle, hooked the wife and took the husband for all the money. He was pretty good at it, too, from what I hear. Till, sadly, one of his marks, in despair, took a gun, shot up his wife and blew his own head off. All in front of their little boy. I paid Tony to pull his jacket. Turns out Frank Duckett used to be named Frank Sawyer. A name I believe you appropriated for yourself.
james_ford This is him?
hibbs That's him.
kate_austen Thanks for the loaner.
dr_jack_shephard Always a pleasure.
kate_austen So, was anyone curious where they came from?
dr_jack_shephard The others knew there was a Marshal on the plane. I guess they just assumed he was traveling alone, protecting them from terrorists. Sounds like a good theory to me.
kate_austen Did you get all the guns back?
dr_jack_shephard All except one.
kate_austen Who?
dr_jack_shephard Let me give you 3 guesses.
kate_austen Sawyer. I can get it back.
dr_jack_shephard Really? How are you going to do that?
kate_austen Speak his language.
dr_jack_shephard You've done this before, Kate. And if I remember it right, you made out with him, and he never even had what you said you could get.
kate_austen Well, I only made out with him because torturing him didn't work.
dr_jack_shephard Let him keep the gun. It's not worth it.
kate_austen What, are you worried he's going to shoot me if I ask?
dr_jack_shephard I just don't want you to owe him anything.
claire_littleton Hey.
charlie_pace Hi. How are you feeling?
claire_littleton Very pregnant. I -- I had some dreams last night. Actually, more like memories. You were in them.
charlie_pace Sorry.
claire_littleton Thought I'd see if you wanted to go for a walk.
charlie_pace Sorry. I have to... do something.
claire_littleton Sure.
charlie_pace See you later, okay?
james_ford Son of a bitch.
kate_austen A boar? Did all this?
james_ford Last night -- wrecked my tent. This morning when I went to get my tent back it attacks me from behind and runs off into the jungle like a coward.
kate_austen A boar wouldn't just attack you for no reason.
james_ford Thank you, boar expert. This one did. It's harassing me.
kate_austen What are doing?
james_ford Getting even.
kate_austen Would you listen to yourself? It's a boar. Just go tell Locke and he'll kill it.
james_ford Nope. This is my fight.
kate_austen Do you know anything about hunting boar? You are going to get yourself lost, or worse.
james_ford Since when do you care?
kate_austen I don't.
james_ford Good. Then if you'll excuse me, I've got some revenge to tend to.
laurence You must be Hibbs' mate. I did a few jobs with Hibbs back in the States. Nice enough fella.
james_ford He's a son of a bitch.
laurence Right, indeed he is. A few disclaimers Australia doesn't allow its citizens to carry handguns. You get nicked with this...
james_ford I'm not going to rat you out.
laurence Secondly, you know, I've been doing this for awhile and a man who buys a compact 357 with hollow point loads -- he's not looking to scare or steal. He's looking to kill. But when it comes down to it, if he finds he doesn't have what it takes to do the job...
james_ford Your sales pitch needs some work.
laurence What I'm saying is, you look a man in the eye and you point a gun at him, you find who you really are, mate. And should you find you're not a killer, there's no refund.
james_ford Won't be a problem.
charlie_pace Hurley, look, I appreciate the help. You don't have to. I killed Ethan, I can bury him.
hugo_reyes Yeah, 'til he rises from the dead. Dude, I know how this works. This is going to end with you and me running through the jungle screaming and crying. He catches me first because I'm heavy and I get cramps.
hugo_reyes You alright?
hugo_reyes Yo, Sayid, can I ask you a question?
sayid_jarrah Of course.
hugo_reyes Did you ever get that Gulf War syndrome?
sayid_jarrah That was the other side.
hugo_reyes Oh, right. Then what's the one when you're all, like, shell-shocked?
sayid_jarrah Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
hugo_reyes Yeah, that's it. Did you ever have that?
sayid_jarrah Why do you ask?
hugo_reyes Because I'm worried about Charlie.
sayid_jarrah What's wrong with Charlie?
hugo_reyes I mean, he killed a guy. He shot him in the chest 4 times. Maybe you should talk to him.
kate_austen It's a foot print. Based on the weight and the distance between strides, I'd say you've been following Boone for about an hour.
james_ford Look...
kate_austen It could be Charlie, I suppose.
james_ford I'm tickled you're taking such an interest in my affairs. I really am. So don't take it personal when I tell you to go...
kate_austen I want carte blanche.
james_ford What?
kate_austen It's simple. You can't track this boar without my help. Over the last few hours you have managed to follow the tracks of humans, birds, a rock slide, yourself, basically everything except boar. You have no idea what you're doing.
james_ford Carte blanche...
kate_austen It means blank check.
james_ford I know what it means.
kate_austen Anytime I want something from your stash -- medicine, soap, whatever -- I get it. No questions asked. Take it or leave it.
james_ford Alright, you got a deal.
kate_austen Where did you get that?
james_ford Plane.
kate_austen Jack was looking for the liquor cart.
james_ford It's a good thing I found it instead, then, huh?
kate_austen Got any more of those?
james_ford I've got a lot more of everything, but you ain't got carte blanche yet.
kate_austen Is that a no?
james_ford Alright, sassafras, but if you want to drink, you've got to play.
kate_austen Play what?
james_ford I never.
kate_austen What?
james_ford I never.
kate_austen How am I supposed to know what that means?
james_ford Call it a way to get to know each other better. For example, I know you've never been to college.
kate_austen And how do you know that?
james_ford If you had, you'd have heard about I never. It's simple, you say "I never" and then you finish the sentence. If it's something you did you drink, if it's something you never did, you don't drink.
kate_austen That makes absolutely no sense.
james_ford Learn by example. I never kissed a man. Now you drink 'cause you've kissed man. Your turn.
kate_austen I never implied that I've been to college when I never have.
james_ford I never been to Disneyland.
james_ford Ah, that's just sad.
kate_austen I never wore pink.
kate_austen I knew it.
james_ford The '80's. I never voted democrat.
kate_austen I never voted.
james_ford I've never been in love.
kate_austen You've never been in love?
james_ford I ain't drinking, am I?
kate_austen I've never had a one night stand.
kate_austen Bottoms up, sailor.
james_ford I've gotta drink for each one.
kate_austen Your turn.
james_ford I've never been married.
kate_austen It didn't last very long. I never blamed a boar for all my problems.
james_ford I never cared about having carte blanche because I just wanted to spend some time with the only other person on this Island that just don't belong.
kate_austen I never carried a letter around for 20 years because I couldn't get over my baggage.
james_ford I never killed a man.
james_ford Well, looks like we got something in common, after all.
kate_austen You okay? You were shaking.
james_ford I'm fine. I was just having a...
james_ford I can't believe this.
kate_austen There are hoof marks everywhere.
james_ford It ate all our stuff?
kate_austen Nope. It ate your stuff. Mine's fine.
james_ford Oh, that hog's gonna suffer. I swear to god.
john_locke Mornin'. What happened to your campsite?
kate_austen So, what are you doing all the way out here, John?
john_locke Looking for salvage from the crash.
kate_austen Find anything useful?
john_locke Occasional scrap of metal, a few bags of coffee. I picked up your path about a mile back, I thought I'd say howdy.
james_ford Awww, son of a -- ohhh, peed on my shirt! Took my shirt out of the bag and peed on it! And you say this ain't personal.
kate_austen He thinks the boar we're after has a vendetta against him.
john_locke Uh-huh.
james_ford That's 3 times it's attacked me.
kate_austen Maybe it's got your scent, doesn't like your cologne?
james_ford I don't wear cologne.
kate_austen Yes, you do.
james_ford Yeah, well. The thing's got it in for me.
kate_austen It's a boar, Sawyer.
john_locke My sister, Jeanie, died when I was a boy. Fell off the monkey bars and broke her neck. And my mother, well, my foster mother, she blamed herself, of course. She thought she wasn't watching close enough. So, she stopped eating, stopped sleeping. The neighbors started talking, afraid she might do something to herself, I guess. Oh, that's good. Anyway, about 6 months after Jeanie's funeral, this golden retriever comes padding up our driveway, walks right into our house, sits down on the floor, and looks right at my mother, there on the couch. And my mother looks back at the dog. After about a minute of this, of them both staring at each other like that, my mother burst into tears. Beautiful dog, no tags, no collar, healthy, and sweet. The dog slept in Jeanie's old room, on Jeanie's old bed and stayed with us until my mother passed 5 years later. Then, disappeared back to wherever it was she came from in the first place.
kate_austen So, you're saying the dog was your sister?
john_locke Well, that would be silly. But my mother thought it was, thought that Jeanie had come back to tell her the accident wasn't her fault, let her off the hook.
frank_duckett Good to go. Only two choices, shrimp in mild sauce, shrimp in hot sauce. Ssss, Pal?
james_ford I'll go with the hot.
frank_duckett Hot it is. Fellow American, huh? Good for you. You missed the lunch rush. Whereabouts you from?
james_ford Tennessee.
frank_duckett Yeah. I love the south. Miss those southern women. In Australia long?
james_ford Not really.
frank_duckett For what it's worth, we've got a special at the truck here. Half price for all Americans. Name's Frank, by the way.
james_ford James.
frank_duckett Good to meet you, James. One shrimp and hot sauce.
james_ford Again.
bartender Are you sure about that, mate?
james_ford Again.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD You tell 'em, cowboy. These bastards think Americans can't hold their liquor. I, uh, I hate to hold my hand out, but I seem to have misplaced my wallet.
james_ford Set him up.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD I drink to you. What's your name, cowboy.
james_ford Sawyer.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD To Sawyer, may he find whatever he's looking for in the bottom of a glass. So, Sawyer, what brings you to Sydney?
james_ford Business.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD You know why they call Australia down under, don't you? Because it's as close as you can get to hell without being burned.
james_ford How about you leave the bottles? What'd you handle, back in the States?
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD I was a Chief of Surgery.
james_ford Was?
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Yeah, was.
james_ford So, we're in hell, huh?
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Don't let the air conditioning fool you, son. You are here, too. You are suffering. But, don't beat yourself up about it. It's fate. Some people are just supposed to suffer. That's why the Red Sox will never win the damn series. I have a son who's about your age. He's not like me, he does what's in his heart. He's a good man, maybe a great one. And right now, he thinks that I hate him. He thinks I feel betrayed by him. But what I really feel is gratitude, and pride because of what he did to me. What he did for me. It took more courage than I have. There's a pay phone over here. I could pick it up and I could call my son. I could tell him about all this. I could tell him that I love him. One simple phone call and I could fix everything.
james_ford Why don't you?
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Because I am weak. This -- this business that you have, will it ease your suffering?
james_ford Yeah.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Then what are you doing here?
james_ford It ain't that simple.
dr_christian_shephard SHEPHARD Of course it is. Unless you want to end up like me, of course it is.
sayid_jarrah You're developing quite a talent.
charlie_pace Yeah. -- I get it. You're here to check up on me.
sayid_jarrah You killed a man.
charlie_pace A man who killed one of us, who kidnapped Claire, who strung me up and left me for dead. He deserved to die. I'd do it again in a minute. Pardon me, if I'm fresh out of bad feeling.
sayid_jarrah When I was in the army in Tikrit, in Iraq, the man who lived next door was a policeman. One day his car was rigged with a bomb. It killed his wife and 3 young children instead. They caught the man who did it. I volunteered to be on the firing squad, and I did my duty without a single ounce of remorse. Then, for no reason, I found myself waking up at night, replaying what I did in my head.
charlie_pace It looks like you're the one who needs checking up on.
sayid_jarrah All I'm saying is that what happened with Ethan will be with you for the rest of your life.
charlie_pace Any suggestions?
sayid_jarrah You're not alone. Don't pretend to be.
james_ford I take comfort knowing that someday this all going to be a real nice shopping complex. Maybe even an auto mall. Where you going?
kate_austen Know what that is?
james_ford A hole in the mud.
kate_austen It's a wallow.
james_ford What the hell's a wallow?
kate_austen A boar's wallow? It's a den where he sleeps. And these tree rubbings are from his tusks.
james_ford You mean he's around here?
kate_austen Maybe.
kate_austen Sawyer?
james_ford Gotcha, ha ha ha.
kate_austen I thought it'd be bigger.
james_ford Funny. Now we know daddy's got to be around here. Here piggy, piggy, piggy.
kate_austen Hey, Sawyer, put it down. That's not funny.
james_ford Here piggy, piggy, piggy!
kate_austen Put it down. What is the matter with you, Sawyer?! You're going to hurt it!
james_ford We're right over here!
kate_austen Not funny.
james_ford Oww.
kate_austen You're sick.
james_ford I didn't hurt it.
kate_austen Find your own way home.
james_ford No problem!
james_ford Sawyer. I've got a letter for you. "Dear Mr. Sawyer..."
frank_duckett Who?
james_ford You used to go by the name of Sawyer.
frank_duckett What the hell are you talking about? You didn't have to -- tell Hibbs I would've paid.
james_ford How do you know Hibbs?
frank_duckett You don't -- you don't know what you're doing, do you?
james_ford You borrowed money from Hibbs?
frank_duckett I was going to pay. It'll come back around.
james_ford Kate?!
james_ford It's just a boar. Let's get back to camp.
charlie_pace Hey.
claire_littleton Hey.
charlie_pace Want to take that walk now?
claire_littleton Sure.
james_ford Stick 'em up.
dr_jack_shephard Trying to be funny?
james_ford Yeah, I was fresh out of pies to throw at you. Here you go, sheriff.
dr_jack_shephard I asked you for this 2 days ago.
james_ford And I told you, stick it. But I made a deal with your girlfriend.
dr_jack_shephard What did she give you? Kate -- what did she give you?
james_ford Nothing she wasn't willing to part with.
dr_jack_shephard That's why the Sox will never win the series.
james_ford What's that?
dr_jack_shephard Huh?
james_ford What'd you just say?
dr_jack_shephard I said "That's why the Red Sox will never win the series".
james_ford What the hell is that supposed to mean?
dr_jack_shephard It's just something my father used to say -- going through life knowing that people hated him. Instead of taking responsibility for it, he just put it on fate. Said he was made that way.
james_ford Your daddy, he a doctor, too?
dr_jack_shephard Was. He is dead. Why do you want to know about my father?
james_ford No reason.

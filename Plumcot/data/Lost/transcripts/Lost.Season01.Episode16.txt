sayid_jarrah Boar took your tarp ?
james_ford It was dark , but
james_ford yeah , I'm pretty sure it was a boar .
sayid_jarrah I thought the boar had vacated this area ?
james_ford Well , genius , I think we got some bad info .
sayid_jarrah What was he doing inside your tent ?
james_ford It was staring at me .
james_ford Then it came at me , so I hit it , and it ran off into the jungle .
sayid_jarrah With you tarp ?
sayid_jarrah Perhaps he wanted to go camping ?
james_ford You enjoying yourself ?
sayid_jarrah Yes .
james_ford Well , laugh it up , Mohammad .
james_ford But I come back and find my stuff's gone , I'm coming after you .
james_ford Sayid , what did you hear ?
james_ford After you ran into the French woman you said you heard something in the jungle .
sayid_jarrah I was injured and I was exhausted , my mind was playing tricks .
james_ford What did you hear ?
sayid_jarrah I thought I heard whispering .
james_ford What was it saying ?
sayid_jarrah Why ?
sayid_jarrah Did you hear something ?
james_ford Forget it .
james_ford I didn't hear anything .
MARY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode16 What are you so afraid of ?
james_ford I'm not the one trembling , sweetness .
hibbs Okay , this is really awkward , but if I don't say something now , things are liable to get downright embarrassing .
james_ford Hibbs .
hibbs Hello , Sawyer .
hibbs Ma'am , I must apologize .
hibbs I
hibbs -- I figured my good friend Sawyer here would be alone .
hibbs I just need a few minutes .
james_ford Listen , baby ...
MARY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode16  Baby , who is this ?
james_ford Listen , go down to the bar , get a drink ...
MARY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode16 No , I don't want to leave you here .
james_ford As soon as I get rid of him , then I'll come get you
james_ford and I'll explain everything .
MARY#unknown#Lost.Season01.Episode16 But , I ...
james_ford Listen , just trust me on this .
james_ford I will find you , I promise .
james_ford I promise .
hibbs I've got to hand it to you , Sawbucks .
hibbs How you find women that beautiful to work your grift .
james_ford Now , if I'm not mistaken , I'm fairly certain
james_ford I said I'd kill you if I ever saw you again .
hibbs That's why I'm here , to make things right .
hibbs Besides , we both know you ain't the killing type .
hibbs Here .
hibbs I figure that makes us even for the Tampa job .
james_ford What could possibly make us even for the Tampa job ?
hibbs How about the known whereabouts of the man who ruined your life ?
hibbs I'm going to make myself a drink .
hibbs You want one ?
hibbs You remember old man Parks , right ?
hibbs Ran capper for us on that gig in Atlanta .
james_ford Yeah , what about him ?
hibbs He's been working the wire at an off track parlor down in Sydney .
hibbs So , last week one of his regulars gets a little too sauced , starts running his mouth off about his glory days as a grifter .
hibbs That guy , Frank Duckett .
hibbs Real hard luck case - gambling addict , alcoholic , runs a shrimp truck .
hibbs Back in the day this guy Duckett was quite the hustler .
hibbs He ran the romance angle , hooked the wife and took the husband for all the money .
hibbs He was pretty good at it , too , from what I hear .
hibbs Till , sadly , one of his marks , in despair , took a gun , shot up his wife and blew his own head off .
hibbs All in front of their little boy .
hibbs I paid Tony to pull his jacket .
hibbs Turns out Frank Duckett used to be named Frank Sawyer .
hibbs A name I believe you appropriated for yourself .
james_ford This is him ?
hibbs That's him .
kate_austen Thanks for the loaner .
dr_jack_shephard Always a pleasure .
kate_austen So , was anyone curious where they came from ?
dr_jack_shephard The others knew there was a Marshal on the plane .
dr_jack_shephard I guess they just assumed he was traveling alone , protecting them from terrorists .
dr_jack_shephard Sounds like a good theory to me .
kate_austen Did you get all the guns back ?
dr_jack_shephard All except one .
kate_austen Who ?
dr_jack_shephard Let me give you 3 guesses .
kate_austen Sawyer .
kate_austen I can get it back .
dr_jack_shephard Really ?
dr_jack_shephard How are you going to do that ?
kate_austen Speak his language .
dr_jack_shephard You've done this before , Kate .
dr_jack_shephard And if I remember it right , you made out with him , and he never even had what you said you could get .
kate_austen Well , I only made out with him because torturing him didn't work .
dr_jack_shephard Let him keep the gun .
dr_jack_shephard It's not worth it .
kate_austen What , are you worried he's going to shoot me if I ask ?
dr_jack_shephard I just don't want you to owe him anything .
claire_littleton Hey .
charlie_pace Hi .
charlie_pace How are you feeling ?
claire_littleton Very pregnant .
claire_littleton I
claire_littleton -- I had some dreams last night .
claire_littleton Actually , more like memories .
claire_littleton You were in them .
charlie_pace Sorry .
claire_littleton Thought I'd see if you wanted to go for a walk .
charlie_pace Sorry .
charlie_pace I have to ... do something .
claire_littleton Sure .
charlie_pace See you later , okay ?
james_ford Son of a bitch .
kate_austen A boar ?
kate_austen Did all this ?
james_ford Last night -- wrecked my tent .
james_ford This morning when I went to get my tent back it attacks me from behind and runs off into the jungle like a coward .
kate_austen A boar wouldn't just attack you for no reason .
james_ford Thank you , boar expert .
james_ford This one did .
james_ford It's harassing me .
kate_austen What are doing ?
james_ford Getting even .
kate_austen Would you listen to yourself ?
kate_austen It's a boar .
kate_austen Just go tell Locke
kate_austen and he'll kill it .
james_ford Nope .
james_ford This is my fight .
kate_austen Do you know anything about hunting boar ?
kate_austen You are going to get yourself lost , or worse .
james_ford Since when do you care ?
kate_austen I don't .
james_ford Good .
james_ford Then if you'll excuse me , I've got some revenge to tend to .
laurence You must be Hibbs' mate .
laurence I did a few jobs with Hibbs back in the States .
laurence Nice enough fella .
james_ford He's a son of a bitch .
laurence Right , indeed he is .
laurence A few disclaimers Australia doesn't allow its citizens to carry handguns .
laurence You get nicked with this ...
james_ford I'm not going to rat you out .
laurence Secondly , you know , I've been doing this for awhile and a man who buys a compact 357 with hollow point loads
laurence -- he's not looking to scare or steal .
laurence He's looking to kill .
laurence But when it comes down to it , if he finds he doesn't have what it takes to do the job ...
james_ford Your sales pitch needs some work .
laurence What I'm saying is , you look a man in the eye
laurence and you point a gun at him , you find who you really are , mate .
laurence And should you find you're not a killer , there's no refund .
james_ford Won't be a problem .
charlie_pace Hurley , look , I appreciate the help .
charlie_pace You don't have to .
charlie_pace I killed Ethan , I can bury him .
hugo_reyes Yeah , 'til he rises from the dead .
hugo_reyes Dude , I know how this works .
hugo_reyes This is going to end with you and me running through the jungle screaming and crying .
hugo_reyes He catches me first because I'm heavy and I get cramps .
hugo_reyes You alright ?
hugo_reyes Yo , Sayid , can I ask you a question ?
sayid_jarrah Of course .
hugo_reyes Did you ever get that Gulf War syndrome ?
sayid_jarrah That was the other side .
hugo_reyes Oh , right .
hugo_reyes Then what's the one when you're all , like , shell-shocked ?
sayid_jarrah Post Traumatic Stress Disorder .
hugo_reyes Yeah , that's it .
hugo_reyes Did you ever have that ?
sayid_jarrah Why do you ask ?
hugo_reyes Because I'm worried about Charlie .
sayid_jarrah What's wrong with Charlie ?
hugo_reyes I mean , he killed a guy .
hugo_reyes He shot him in the chest 4 times .
hugo_reyes Maybe you should talk to him .
kate_austen It's a foot print .
kate_austen Based on the weight and the distance between strides , I'd say you've been following Boone for about an hour .
james_ford Look ...
kate_austen It could be Charlie , I suppose .
james_ford I'm tickled you're taking such an interest in my affairs .
james_ford I really am .
james_ford So don't take it personal when I tell you to go ...
kate_austen I want carte blanche .
james_ford What ?
kate_austen It's simple .
kate_austen You can't track this boar without my help .
kate_austen Over the last few hours you have managed to follow the tracks of humans , birds , a rock slide , yourself , basically everything except boar .
kate_austen You have no idea what you're doing .
james_ford Carte blanche ...
kate_austen It means blank check .
james_ford I know what it means .
kate_austen Anytime I want something from your stash -- medicine , soap , whatever -- I get it .
kate_austen No questions asked .
kate_austen Take it or leave it .
james_ford Alright , you got a deal .
kate_austen Where did you get that ?
james_ford Plane .
kate_austen Jack was looking for the liquor cart .
james_ford It's a good thing I found it instead , then , huh ?
kate_austen Got any more of those ?
james_ford I've got a lot more of everything , but you ain't got carte blanche yet .
kate_austen Is that a no ?
james_ford Alright , sassafras , but if you want to drink , you've got to play .
kate_austen Play what ?
james_ford I never .
kate_austen What ?
james_ford I never .
kate_austen How am I supposed to know what that means ?
james_ford Call it a way to get to know each other better .
james_ford For example , I know you've never been to college .
kate_austen And how do you know that ?
james_ford If you had , you'd have heard about I never .
james_ford It's simple , you say " I never " and then you finish the sentence .
james_ford If it's something you did you drink , if it's something you never did , you don't drink .
kate_austen That makes absolutely no sense .
james_ford Learn by example .
james_ford I never kissed a man .
james_ford Now you drink 'cause you've kissed man .
james_ford Your turn .
kate_austen I never implied that I've been to college when I never have .
james_ford I never been to Disneyland .
james_ford Ah , that's just sad .
kate_austen I never wore pink .
kate_austen I knew it .
james_ford The '80's .
james_ford I never voted democrat .
kate_austen I never voted .
james_ford I've never been in love .
kate_austen You've never been in love ?
james_ford I ain't drinking , am I ?
kate_austen I've never had a one night stand .
kate_austen Bottoms up , sailor .
james_ford I've gotta drink for each one .
kate_austen Your turn .
james_ford I've never been married .
kate_austen It didn't last very long .
kate_austen I never blamed a boar for all my problems .
james_ford I never cared about having carte blanche because I just wanted to spend some time with the only other person on this Island that just don't belong .
kate_austen I never carried a letter around for 20 years because I couldn't get over my baggage .
james_ford I never killed a man .
james_ford Well , looks like we got something in common , after all .
kate_austen You
kate_austen okay ?
kate_austen You were shaking .
james_ford I'm fine .
james_ford I was just having a ...
james_ford I can't believe this .
kate_austen There are hoof marks everywhere .
james_ford It ate all our stuff ?
kate_austen Nope .
kate_austen It ate your stuff .
kate_austen Mine's fine .
james_ford Oh , that hog's gonna suffer .
james_ford I swear to god .
john_locke Mornin' .
john_locke What happened to your campsite ?
kate_austen So , what are you doing all the way out here , John ?
john_locke Looking for salvage from the crash .
kate_austen Find anything useful ?
john_locke Occasional scrap of metal , a few bags of coffee .
john_locke I picked up your path about a mile back , I thought I'd say howdy .
james_ford Awww , son of a -- ohhh , peed on my shirt !
james_ford Took my shirt out of the bag and peed on it !
james_ford And you say this ain't personal .
kate_austen He thinks the boar we're after has a vendetta against him .
john_locke Uh-huh .
james_ford That's 3 times
james_ford it's attacked me .
kate_austen Maybe it's got your scent , doesn't like your cologne ?
james_ford I don't wear cologne .
kate_austen Yes , you do .
james_ford Yeah , well .
james_ford The thing's got it in for me .
kate_austen It's a boar , Sawyer .
john_locke My sister , Jeanie , died when I was a boy .
john_locke Fell off the monkey bars and broke her neck .
john_locke And my mother , well , my foster mother , she blamed herself , of course .
john_locke She thought she wasn't watching close enough .
john_locke So , she stopped eating , stopped sleeping .
john_locke The neighbors started talking , afraid she might do something to herself , I guess .
john_locke Oh , that's good .
john_locke Anyway , about 6 months after Jeanie's funeral , this golden retriever comes padding up our driveway , walks right into our house , sits down on the floor , and looks right at my mother , there on the couch .
john_locke And my mother looks back at the dog .
john_locke After about a minute of this , of them both staring at each other like that , my mother burst into tears .
john_locke Beautiful dog , no tags , no collar , healthy , and sweet .
john_locke The dog slept in Jeanie's old room , on Jeanie's old bed and stayed with us until my mother passed 5 years later .
john_locke Then , disappeared back to wherever it was she came from in the first place .
kate_austen So , you're saying the dog was your sister ?
john_locke Well , that would be silly .
john_locke But my mother thought it was , thought that Jeanie had come back to tell her the accident wasn't her fault , let her off the hook .
frank_duckett Good to go .
frank_duckett Only two choices , shrimp in mild sauce , shrimp in hot sauce .
frank_duckett Ssss , Pal ?
james_ford I'll go with the hot .
frank_duckett Hot it is .
frank_duckett Fellow American , huh ?
frank_duckett Good for you .
frank_duckett You missed the lunch rush .
frank_duckett Whereabouts you from ?
james_ford Tennessee .
frank_duckett Yeah .
frank_duckett I love the south .
frank_duckett Miss those southern women .
frank_duckett In Australia long ?
james_ford Not really .
frank_duckett For what it's worth , we've got a special at the truck here .
frank_duckett Half price for all Americans .
frank_duckett Name's Frank , by the way .
james_ford James .
frank_duckett Good to meet you , James .
frank_duckett One shrimp and hot sauce .
james_ford Again .
bartender Are you sure about that , mate ?
james_ford Again .
dr_christian_shephard You tell 'em , cowboy .
dr_christian_shephard These bastards think Americans can't hold their liquor .
dr_christian_shephard I , uh , I hate to hold my hand out , but I seem to have misplaced my wallet .
james_ford Set him up .
dr_christian_shephard I drink to you .
dr_christian_shephard What's your name , cowboy .
james_ford Sawyer .
dr_christian_shephard , may he find whatever he's looking for in the bottom of a glass .
dr_christian_shephard So , Sawyer , what brings you to Sydney ?
james_ford Business .
dr_christian_shephard You know why they call Australia down under , don't you ?
dr_christian_shephard Because it's as close as you can get to hell without being burned .
james_ford How about you leave the bottles ?
james_ford What'd you handle , back in the States ?
dr_christian_shephard I was a Chief of Surgery .
james_ford Was ?
dr_christian_shephard Yeah , was .
james_ford So , we're in hell , huh ?
dr_christian_shephard Don't let the air conditioning fool you , son .
dr_christian_shephard You are here , too .
dr_christian_shephard You are suffering .
dr_christian_shephard But , don't beat yourself up about it .
dr_christian_shephard It's fate .
dr_christian_shephard Some people are just supposed to suffer .
dr_christian_shephard That's why the Red Sox will never win the damn series .
dr_christian_shephard I have a son who's about your age .
dr_christian_shephard He's not like me , he does what's in his heart .
dr_christian_shephard He's a good man , maybe a great one .
dr_christian_shephard And right now , he thinks that I hate him .
dr_christian_shephard He thinks I feel betrayed by him .
dr_christian_shephard But what I really feel is gratitude , and pride because of what he did to me .
dr_christian_shephard What he did for me .
dr_christian_shephard It took more courage than I have .
dr_christian_shephard There's a pay phone over here .
dr_christian_shephard I could pick it up and I could call my son .
dr_christian_shephard I could tell him about all this .
dr_christian_shephard I could tell him that I love him .
dr_christian_shephard One simple phone call
dr_christian_shephard and I could fix everything .
james_ford Why don't you ?
dr_christian_shephard Because I am weak .
dr_christian_shephard This --
dr_christian_shephard this business that you have , will it ease your suffering ?
james_ford Yeah .
dr_christian_shephard Then what are you doing here ?
james_ford It ain't that simple .
dr_christian_shephard Of course it is .
dr_christian_shephard Unless you want to end up like me , of course it is .
sayid_jarrah You're developing quite a talent .
charlie_pace Yeah .
charlie_pace -- I get it .
charlie_pace You're here to check up on me .
sayid_jarrah You killed a man .
charlie_pace A man who killed one of us , who kidnapped Claire , who strung me up and left me for dead .
charlie_pace He deserved to die .
charlie_pace I'd do it again in a minute .
charlie_pace Pardon me , if I'm fresh out of bad feeling .
sayid_jarrah When I was in the army in Tikrit , in Iraq , the man who lived next door was a policeman .
sayid_jarrah One day his car was rigged with a bomb .
sayid_jarrah It killed his wife and 3 young children instead .
sayid_jarrah They caught the man who did it .
sayid_jarrah I volunteered to be on the firing squad , and I did my duty without a single ounce of remorse .
sayid_jarrah Then , for no reason , I found myself waking up at night , replaying what I did in my head .
charlie_pace It looks like you're the one who needs checking up on .
sayid_jarrah All I'm saying is that what happened with Ethan will be with you for the rest of your life .
charlie_pace Any suggestions ?
sayid_jarrah You're not alone .
sayid_jarrah Don't pretend to be .
james_ford I take comfort knowing that someday this all going to be a real nice shopping complex .
james_ford Maybe even an auto mall .
james_ford Where you going ?
kate_austen Know what that is ?
james_ford A hole in the mud .
kate_austen It's a wallow .
james_ford What the hell's a wallow ?
kate_austen A boar's wallow ?
kate_austen It's a den where he sleeps .
kate_austen And these tree rubbings are from his tusks .
james_ford You mean he's around here ?
kate_austen Maybe .
kate_austen Sawyer ?
james_ford Gotcha , ha ha ha .
kate_austen I thought it'd be bigger .
james_ford Funny .
james_ford Now we know daddy's got to be around here .
james_ford Here piggy , piggy , piggy .
kate_austen Hey , Sawyer , put it down .
kate_austen That's not funny .
james_ford Here piggy , piggy , piggy !
kate_austen Put it down .
kate_austen What is the matter with you , Sawyer? !
kate_austen You're going to hurt it !
james_ford We're right over here !
kate_austen Not funny .
james_ford Oww .
kate_austen You're sick .
james_ford I didn't hurt it .
kate_austen Find your own way home .
james_ford No problem !
james_ford Sawyer .
james_ford I've got a letter for you . "
james_ford Dear Mr .
james_ford Sawyer ...
james_ford "
frank_duckett Who ?
james_ford You used to go by the name of Sawyer .
frank_duckett What the hell are you talking about ?
frank_duckett You didn't have to -- tell Hibbs I would've paid .
james_ford How do you know Hibbs ?
frank_duckett You don't -- you don't know what you're doing , do you ?
james_ford You borrowed money from Hibbs ?
frank_duckett I was going to pay .
frank_duckett It'll come back around .
james_ford Kate? !
james_ford It's just a boar .
james_ford Let's get back to camp .
charlie_pace Hey .
claire_littleton Hey .
charlie_pace Want to take that walk now ?
claire_littleton Sure .
james_ford Stick 'em up .
dr_jack_shephard Trying to be funny ?
james_ford Yeah , I was fresh out of pies to throw at you .
james_ford Here you go , sheriff .
dr_jack_shephard I asked you for this 2 days ago .
james_ford And I told you , stick it .
james_ford But I made a deal with your girlfriend .
dr_jack_shephard What did she give you ?
dr_jack_shephard Kate -- what did she give you ?
james_ford Nothing she wasn't willing to part with .
dr_jack_shephard That's why the Sox will never win the series .
james_ford What's that ?
dr_jack_shephard Huh ?
james_ford What'd you just say ?
dr_jack_shephard I said " That's why the Red Sox will never win the series " .
james_ford What the hell is that supposed to mean ?
dr_jack_shephard It's just something my father used to say -- going through life knowing that people hated him .
dr_jack_shephard Instead of taking responsibility for it , he just put it on fate .
dr_jack_shephard Said he was made that way .
james_ford Your daddy , he a doctor , too ?
dr_jack_shephard Was .
dr_jack_shephard He is dead .
dr_jack_shephard Why do you want to know about my father ?
james_ford No reason .

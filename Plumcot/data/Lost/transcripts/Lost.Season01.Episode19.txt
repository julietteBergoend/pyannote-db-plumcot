kid What's that ?
john_locke A game .
john_locke It's my favorite game , actually .
john_locke I used to play it with my brother .
john_locke It's called Mouse Trap .
kid How do you play ?
john_locke Well , you start with all these parts off the board .
john_locke And then , one by one , you build the trap - shoe , bucket , tub - piece by piece it all comes together .
john_locke And then you wait 'til your opponent lands here on the old cheese wheel .
john_locke And then if you set it up just right , you spring the trap .
john_locke Go ahead , kiddo .
john_locke May I help you , ma'am ?
emily_locke Yes , um , could you tell me where the footballs are ?
john_locke Aisle 8 for regulation , aisle 15 for Nerf .
emily_locke Oh , yes , thank you .
emily_locke Thanks .
boone_carlyle You want my opinion ?
john_locke Boone , you've got to have some faith .
john_locke All we've got to do is break the glass , and then we're in .
john_locke The trebuchet delivers a half a ton of force .
boone_carlyle Why do they call it a trebuchet ?
boone_carlyle It looks like a catapult .
john_locke It's called a trebuchet , Boone , because it's a trebuchet .
boone_carlyle I don't get you , man .
boone_carlyle One minute you're quoting Nietzsche , now all of the sudden you're an engineer .
boone_carlyle I don't think I can spell trebuchet .
john_locke There's a 't' on the end .
boone_carlyle I'm serious , John .
boone_carlyle We've been coming out here everyday for 2 weeks-you never talk about yourself .
boone_carlyle Everybody's got a story .
john_locke My story would bore you .
john_locke 3 , 2 , 1 .
john_locke This was supposed to work .
john_locke This was supposed to work !
boone_carlyle John .
boone_carlyle Your leg , man .
boone_carlyle Are you okay ?
john_locke Yeah , I'm fine .
boone_carlyle The trebuchet-why didn't it work ?
john_locke It didn't work because it wasn't strong enough .
boone_carlyle I don't think that glass is going to break , man .
boone_carlyle Whatever it's made out of ...
john_locke Everything breaks if you apply the right force .
boone_carlyle So , we're just going to build another one of your inventions , hope it works this time .
john_locke That's right .
boone_carlyle What if it doesn't ?
john_locke Then the Island will tell us what to do .
boone_carlyle What's that ?
john_locke I should get back there -- salvage those pieces .
boone_carlyle Your leg okay ?
john_locke It's fine .

emily_locke I want to tell you that you're special , very special .
emily_locke You're part of a design .
emily_locke You do realize that , don't you ?
emily_locke That our meeting , me finding you , this is a sign of things to come .
emily_locke Great things .
john_locke My father , is he still alive ?
emily_locke Still alive ?

emily_locke You were immaculately conceived .
james_ford Which one ?
sunhwa_kwon That one .
james_ford You're sure ?
james_ford Because this is the one I've been using and nothing's happening .
sunhwa_kwon I'm sorry it's not helping .
kate_austen What's not helping ?
james_ford Nothing .
james_ford Thanks , anyway .
james_ford Nice garden .
kate_austen What was that all about ?
sunhwa_kwon He has headaches .
kate_austen Doesn't he have , like , a truckload of aspirin stashed away somewhere ?
sunhwa_kwon He says aspirin didn't help .
kate_austen Can I ask you a question ?
kate_austen Say you're having bad headaches everyday ...
dr_jack_shephard You
dr_jack_shephard okay ?
kate_austen Yeah , fine .
dr_jack_shephard So , who are we talking about then , Kate ?
kate_austen Sawyer .
dr_jack_shephard Uh-huh .
kate_austen I just think there might be something really wrong with him .
dr_jack_shephard And what does he think ?
kate_austen He says he's fine , but ...
dr_jack_shephard Then he's fine .
kate_austen Yeah , well , he could be playing it down .
kate_austen There could be some ...
dr_jack_shephard Look , Kate , I'd like nothing more than to check the guy out and make sure he's okay .
dr_jack_shephard But we both know all I'm going to get for my trouble
dr_jack_shephard is a snappy one-liner .
dr_jack_shephard And if I'm real lucky , a brand new nickname .
dr_jack_shephard I'm just over it .
john_locke You're late .
boone_carlyle Late for what ?
john_locke Late for work .
boone_carlyle I think I'm done working , John .
john_locke I'm sorry ,
john_locke what ?
boone_carlyle It's useless .
boone_carlyle You can't open that thing up .
boone_carlyle You say you can
boone_carlyle but you can't .
john_locke No , don't tell me what I can't do .
boone_carlyle Don't you get it ?
boone_carlyle It's a dead end .
boone_carlyle You're not getting in .
john_locke That's impossible .
john_locke We didn't find this by accident .
john_locke We're supposed to ...
boone_carlyle Oh , we're supposed to .
boone_carlyle We're supposed to find this , right ?
boone_carlyle We're supposed to open it , right ?
boone_carlyle Then tell me something , John , if we're supposed to open it , then why the hell haven't we opened it yet ?
john_locke The Island will send us a sign .
boone_carlyle The Island will send us a sign .
john_locke All that's happening now is our faith is being tested - our commitment !
john_locke But we will open it !
john_locke The Island will show us how !
boone_carlyle What kind of sign will the Island send us ?
boone_carlyle Huh , John ?
john_locke Did you see that ?
john_locke Boone ?
boone_carlyle Theresa falls up the stairs .
boone_carlyle Theresa falls down the stairs .
boone_carlyle Theresa falls up the stairs .
boone_carlyle Theresa falls down the stairs .

boone_carlyle Okay , okay , I'm up , I'm up .
boone_carlyle What is going on ?
john_locke C'mon , let's go .
frainey Emily Annabeth Locke in 10,000 words or less .
john_locke So , she's my mother .
frainey I lifted some hairs from her car and matched them with your DNA samples .
frainey It's 99% certain .
frainey She was institutionalized - a few times .
john_locke What for ?
frainey Nothing criminal or violent .
frainey It's a type of schizophrenia .
frainey Apparently , if she stays on her meds , she's okay .
john_locke What about my father ?
frainey Here's the thing --
frainey your mother sought you out , so she's fair game .
frainey But this guy-maybe he doesn't even know you exist .
frainey I've done this enough times to know this stuff isn't meant to be , even though it may feel that way .
frainey But this probably won't have a happy ending .
frainey So , do you want it , or not ?
john_locke I want it .
eddie Your name is ?
john_locke John , John Locke .
john_locke I'm Anthony Cooper's son .
eddie Mr .
eddie Cooper doesn't have a son .
john_locke Tell him I don't want anything .
john_locke My mother is Emily Locke .
john_locke Please .
eddie Just a minute .
eddie Yeah , Mr . Cooper , I've got John Locke here -- says he's your son .
eddie Yes , sir .
eddie Well , you can go on in , sir .

john_locke Yeah , that's , um , thanks .
anthony_cooper So who found who ?
john_locke I'm sorry , sir ?
anthony_cooper Emily , your mother , did she find you or did you find her ?
john_locke She found me .
anthony_cooper How did she look ?
john_locke Alright , I guess .
anthony_cooper Did she say anything about me ?
john_locke She said that I didn't have a father -- that I was immaculately conceived .
anthony_cooper Really ?
anthony_cooper Well , I guess that makes me god , huh ?
anthony_cooper I didn't even know you existed until a year after you were born .
anthony_cooper She told me she wasn't even going to have the baby , you , at all .
anthony_cooper Then she drops off the face of the planet .
anthony_cooper When she turns up again , she's asking for money , telling me she put you up for adoption .
anthony_cooper You going to drink that , or what ?
anthony_cooper You have a family of your own ?
john_locke No , sir .
anthony_cooper Me neither .
anthony_cooper I tried it a couple of times , didn't take .
anthony_cooper Do you hunt ?
john_locke No , no .
anthony_cooper You're not one of those animal rights nut jobs , are you ?
john_locke No .
john_locke No , sir .
anthony_cooper What are you doing this Sunday ?
john_locke Nothin' .
anthony_cooper You want to go hunting ?
john_locke Um , well , I'd like that .
john_locke Yeah , I'd like that very much .
john_locke I had a dream last night .
john_locke I asked for a sign
john_locke and then I saw a plane crash , a Beechcraft right out there .
john_locke It was a dream , but it was the most real thing I've ever experienced .
john_locke I know where to go now .
boone_carlyle Go for what ?
john_locke To find what we need to open this bastard up .
boone_carlyle Have you been using that wacky paste stuff that made me see my sister get eaten ?

boone_carlyle Because , John , I've got to tell you -- signs and dreams
boone_carlyle and ...
john_locke Who's Theresa ?
boone_carlyle What ?
john_locke Theresa falls up the stairs .
john_locke Theresa falls down the stairs .

boone_carlyle How would you know about that ?
john_locke I don't know , Boone , but we're supposed to go to this place .
john_locke We're supposed to find that plane .
john_locke Will you come with me ?
dr_jack_shephard I was going to ask you how this was going , but it's coming together fast .
michael_dawson The fire wasn't a total loss .
michael_dawson We learned a few things from building the first one which is saving us from trial and error .
michael_dawson Now it's just trial .
michael_dawson Yeah ,
michael_dawson yeah ,
michael_dawson yeah ,
michael_dawson yeah .
michael_dawson Yeah , man , I know , now , now , now .

dr_jack_shephard Alright , we'll see you .
james_ford Doc ?
james_ford Sensitivity to the light -- that bad ?
dr_jack_shephard Depends .
james_ford On what ?
dr_jack_shephard On what's causing your headaches .
james_ford It's not like it's a tumor , or something .
dr_jack_shephard What makes you think it's a tumor ?
james_ford I don't .
dr_jack_shephard Great .
dr_jack_shephard Okay , then .
james_ford My uncle .
james_ford He died of a brain tumor .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah ?
james_ford That run in a family ?
james_ford Tumors ?
dr_jack_shephard What type of tumor was it ?
james_ford The type that kills you .
dr_jack_shephard Do you smell anything funny ?
dr_jack_shephard Brain tumors bring on phantom smells , maybe like something burning .
james_ford Just headaches .
dr_jack_shephard Well , I'm sure you're fine then .
dr_jack_shephard Look , if this is worrying you , there's a couple of tests that I could do .
james_ford Sorry , Doc , sounds fun , but my insurance ran out .
dr_jack_shephard Insurance ran out .
dr_jack_shephard That -- that's a good one .
boone_carlyle I could have mentioned her name out by the hatch one day .
john_locke Who ?
boone_carlyle Theresa .
boone_carlyle Maybe I was talking to myself .
john_locke Maybe , but you didn't .
boone_carlyle So , in this dream you saw a plane crash , right ?
john_locke Yeah .

john_locke What is this ?
anthony_cooper It's a dialysis machine .
anthony_cooper My kidney's failing .
anthony_cooper Damn doctors say I need a transplant .
john_locke When ?
anthony_cooper Tomorrow if it were up to me .
anthony_cooper I'm on the donor list , but I'm an old man
anthony_cooper and it's a long list .
john_locke How , how long ...
anthony_cooper John , the dialysis will be fine for a while .
anthony_cooper I didn't tell you for this exact reason .
anthony_cooper I'm not going to let this spoil what's going to be a fantastic day , and neither should you .
anthony_cooper So , I'll get done here and we'll have a nice lunch and go shoot some birds .
boone_carlyle He's a priest .
boone_carlyle How long do you think he's been dead ?
john_locke Normally clothing would completely decompose within 2 years , but this is high quality polyester , could be 2 years , could be 10 .
john_locke Gold teeth , obviously well off .
boone_carlyle What kind of money is that ?
john_locke Nigerian naira .
boone_carlyle What is a Nigerian priest doing on an Island in the South Pacific ?

james_ford A few days ago , a week maybe .
james_ford Do you have to be here ?
dr_jack_shephard Do you have them when you wake up in the morning ?
james_ford Usually they hit me in the middle of the day .
james_ford What the hell are you doing with that thing ?
dr_jack_shephard Checking to see how your pupils respond to changing stimuli .
james_ford What's that -- that nod ?
kate_austen Would you just let him do his thing ?
james_ford I'm letting him , but I want to know what the hell he thinks I-
dr_jack_shephard I think you should just shut up and relax .
james_ford What the hell are you doing ?
dr_jack_shephard Have you ever had a blood transfusion ?
james_ford What ?
james_ford No .
dr_jack_shephard Taken pills for malaria ?
james_ford Nope .

kate_austen but ...
dr_jack_shephard He needs glasses .

boone_carlyle John , we've got to ...
john_locke No , no .
boone_carlyle What is wrong with you ?
boone_carlyle Are you crazy ?
john_locke I was in a wheelchair .
boone_carlyle What ?
john_locke Paralyzed for 4 years .
john_locke The plane , our plane , I was in that chair when we took off .
john_locke But not after we crashed .
boone_carlyle Why were you in a wheelchair ?
john_locke It doesn't matter anymore .
john_locke But , but , this Island , it changed me .
john_locke It made me whole .
john_locke Now it's trying to take it back
john_locke and I don't know why .
john_locke But it wants me to follow what I saw .
boone_carlyle What ?
john_locke I know it sounds crazy .
john_locke 4 weeks ago I wouldn't have believed it myself .
john_locke But you and I are here for a reason .
john_locke There's something that we were meant to find , something that's going to help us get into the hatch .
john_locke I know it .
john_locke But we've got to keep going .
boone_carlyle Okay .
boone_carlyle Can you move your legs ?

anthony_cooper If you have to drop it in high cover ...
john_locke Got him .
anthony_cooper Yeah , you did .
anthony_cooper Good shot , son .
anthony_cooper John , your mother , she may be a little crazy , but at least she brought us together .
anthony_cooper Thank god it happened now , while we still have time .
anthony_cooper Let's find your bird .
boone_carlyle She was my nanny -- Theresa .
boone_carlyle She was my nanny .
boone_carlyle My mother wasn't around much .
boone_carlyle I needed someone to take it out on .
boone_carlyle My bedroom was at the top of this huge flight of stairs , and I would sit in bed all day calling her on the intercom .
boone_carlyle One day she took a bad step , broke her neck .
boone_carlyle I was six .
boone_carlyle Listen , what the hell is so funny ?
john_locke Look .
boone_carlyle Is that the plane you saw ?
john_locke As best I can tell .
boone_carlyle You really saw it ?
john_locke Yeah , I really saw it .
boone_carlyle How long do you think it's been there ?
john_locke Doesn't matter .
john_locke What's important is that we found it .
john_locke What's important is what's inside it .
boone_carlyle What is inside of it , John ?
john_locke You're going to have to climb up there for us and find out .
anthony_cooper You can still change your mind .
john_locke Nah .
john_locke They already shaved my back .
anthony_cooper I'm so thankful for you , John .
john_locke This was meant to be .
anthony_cooper See you on the other side , son .

james_ford Blurry .
dr_jack_shephard Better or worse ?
james_ford Worse .
james_ford Uh-uh , no way .
dr_jack_shephard Sawyer , it's not a fashion show .

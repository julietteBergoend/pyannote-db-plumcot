Lost.Season01.Episode01 MICHAEL: Walt! Walt!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 REDSHIRT: Stay away from the gas! Stay there!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 REDSHIRT #2:  Help! Help! Somebody help me! Help! Help! Ahh, my leg! Ah! Ah!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Hey you, just give me a hand! You, come on! Come over here, give me a hand!  On the count of three: One, two, three.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CLAIRE: Help! Please help me! Help me, please help me!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  All right, get him out of here! Get him away from the engine! Get him out of here!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CLAIRE: Help me, please. I'm having, I'm having contractions.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: How many months pregnant are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CLAIRE: I'm, I'm nearly eight months.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  How far apart are they coming?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CLAIRE: I don't know, a-a few just happened.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 LOCKE: Hey! Hey, hey, hey, get away from there!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 GARY: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Listen to me! Look at me! You're going to be okay, do you understand me? But you have to sit absolutely still!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  Hey, you! Come here! I need you to get this woman away from these fumes! Take her over there. Stay with her. If her contractions occur any closer than three minutes apart, call out for me.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 HURLEY: Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: I'll be right back, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CLAIRE: Thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 HURLEY: Hey! What's your name?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Stop! Her head's not tilted far back enough. You're blowing air into her stomach.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 BOONE: You sure?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 BOONE: That's exactly what I was doing. I'm a lifeguard. I'm licensed.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Yeah, well, you need to seriously think about giving that license back.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 BOONE: Maybe we should do one of those hole things. You know, stick the pen in the throat?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Yeah, good idea. You go get me a pen.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Big deep breaths. Take breaths!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  Move! Move! Move! Get her up! Get her out of there! The wing!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  You okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CLAIRE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  You? . Stay with her.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 HURLEY: Dude, I'm not going anywhere.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 BOONE:  I didn't know which one would work best.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: They're all good. Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Excuse me. Did you ever use a needle?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Did you ever … patch a pair of jeans?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: I, uhm, I made the drapes in my apartment.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: That's fantastic. Listen, do you have a second? I could use a little help here.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: And with what?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: With this.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Look, I'd do it myself, I'm a doctor, but I just can't reach it.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: You want me to sew that up?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: It's just like the drapes, same thing.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: No, with the drapes I used a sewing machine.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: No, you can do this. I'm telling you. If you wouldn't mind.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Of course I will.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Thank you.  It's for your hands. Save me some for the, for the wound.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Any color preference?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  No. Standard black.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 BOONE: Come on.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SAYID:  Hey you. What's your name?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Me? Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SAYID: Charlie. We need help with the fire. No-one will see it if it isn't big.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Okay, I'm on it. What's your name?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SAYID: Sayid.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Sayid. I'm on it, Sayid.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: I might throw up on you.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  You're doing fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: You don't seem afraid at all. I don't understand that.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16 year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I, I accidentally ripped her dural sac. Shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open. And the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I … And the terror was just so … crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. (He's crying). So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it. So I started to count: One, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: If that had been me, I think I would have run for the door.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: No, I don't think that's true. You're not running now.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SAYID: You think they would have come by now.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Huh? Who?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SAYID: Anyone.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SHANNON: As if I'm going to start eating chocolate.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 BOONE: Shannon, we may be here for a while.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SHANNON: The plane had a black box, idiot. They know exactly where they are, they're coming. I'll eat on the rescue boat. . I'll. Eat. On. The. Rescue. Boat. 
Lost.Season01.Episode01 HURLEY: Hungry?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CLAIRE: Yeah, thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 HURLEY: Anymore, uh... you know, baby stuff?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CLAIRE: No. I'm-I'm okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 HURLEY: Well, hang in there.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CLAIRE: Yeah, you too.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 MICHAEL: You sure you're warm enough?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JIN: 내 옆에서 없어지면 안 돼. 내가 어디로 가든지 꼭 따라와. 알겠지?  다른 사람 신경쓰지 말고 우린 같이 있어야 돼. 
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Do you think he's going to live?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Do you know him?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: He was sitting next to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  We must have been at about 40,000 feet when it happened. Hit an air pocket. Dropped, maybe, 200 feet. The turbulence was … I blacked out.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: I didn't. I saw the whole thing. I knew that the tail was gone, but I couldn't bring myself to look back. And then the, the front of the plane broke off.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Well, it's not here on the beach. Neither is the tail. We need to figure out which way we came in.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Because there's a chance we could find the cockpit. If it's intact, we might be able to find a transceiver. Send out a signal, help the rescue party find us.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: How do you know all that?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Took a couple flying lessons. Wasn't for me.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: I saw some smoke. Just through the valley. If you're thinking about going for the cockpit, I'm going with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: I don't know your name.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: I'm Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SHANNON: What was that?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: That was weird, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 WALT: Is that Vincent?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 MICHAEL:  It's not Vincent.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CLAIRE:  Did anybody see that?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 HURLEY:  Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SHANNON: Boone!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Terrific.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CINDY: So, how's the drink?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: It's good.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CINDY: That wasn't a very strong reaction.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Well, it's not a very strong drink.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CINDY:  Shhh. Just don't tell anyone.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: This of course breaks some critical FAA regulations.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Excuse me.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CINDY:  Sir, excuse me!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 ROSE:  Guess he really had to go.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CINDY: Sir, excuse me!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CINDY:  Ladies and gentleman, the pilot has switched on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  It's normal.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 ROSE: Oh, I know. I've just never been a very good flier. My husband keeps reminding me that planes want to be in the air.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Well, he sounds like a very smart man.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 ROSE: Be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Well, I'll keep you company until he does. Don't worry it's going to be over...
Lost.Season01.Episode01 MICHAEL: It didn't sound like an animal. Not exactly, I mean.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 ROSE: That sound that it made, I keep thinking that there was something really familiar about it.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SHANNON: Really? Where are you from?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 ROSE: The Bronx.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Might be monkeys. It's monkeys, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SAWYER: Sure it's monkeys. It's Monkey Island.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 HURLEY: Technically, you know, we don't even know if we're on an island.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SAYID: We're on an Island.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE:  You ready?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Kate, you showed me where the smoke was. I can get there myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: I'm coming.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  Well, you're going to need better shoes.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 MICHAEL: Whatever it was … it wasn't natural.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Does anyone have any sun block?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SHANNON: Yeah, I do.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Ah. Cool.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 HURLEY: So, I was just looking inside the fuselage … It's pretty grim in there. You think we should do something about the, uh …  b-o-d-y-s?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 MICHAEL: What are you spelling, man? "Bodies"?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 WALT: B-o-d-i-e-s.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SAYID: That sounds like a good idea.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 SHANNON: No! They'll deal with it when they get here.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  We go out and look for the cockpit. See if we can find a transceiver, to send a distress signal, help the rescue team. (To Boone) You're going to need to keep an eye on the wounded. If the guy in the suit wakes up, try to keep him calm, but don't let him remove that piece of shrapnel. You understand?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 BOONE: Yeah, got it. What about the guy with the leg? The, the tourniquet.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: I stopped the bleeding. I took it off last night. He … he should be all right.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 BOONE: Yeah. Cool. Good job.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: I'll come with you. I want to help.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: I don't need any more help.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: No, it's cool, I don't really feel like standing still, so.  Excellent.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: May I ask you something?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Me? I'd be thrilled. I've been waiting.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Have we ever met, anywhere?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: No, that would be unlikely.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Hum.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: I look familiar, though, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE:  Can't quite place it?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: No, I can't.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Yeah. I think I know.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: You do?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE:  You all everybody … You all everybody! You've never heard that song?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: I've heard it. I just don't know what the hell it is—
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: That's us. Drive Shaft. Look, the ring—second tour of Finland. You've never heard of Drive Shaft?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE:  The band?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Yeah, the band.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: You were in Drive Shaft.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: I am in Drive Shaft. I play bass.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Seriously?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Yeah, Charlie. Track 3, you know, I do backing vocals.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: My friend Beth would freak. She loved you guys.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Give me Beth's number, I'll call her, I'd, I'd love to.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Hey—
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Does she live nearby?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Have you ever heard of Drive Shaft?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE:  You all everybody... You all every...body.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  We've got to keep moving.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: They were good.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: They are good. We're still together. In the middle of a comeback.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Hey guys, is this normal? Kind of ... day turning into night, you know? End of the world type weather. Is this—guys?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 HURLEY: I don't know if you want to go in there! There's too many bodies.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CLAIRE: There it is again.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 ROSE: Oh my god.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Well? Let's do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Let's get this trans…
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Transceiver.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Transceiver thing and get out of here.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Come on! Come...
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  You okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Yeah. You?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: I'm fine. Charlie's fine, by the way. Okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  Hey. You don't have to come up here.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: No, I'm good.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: So, what does a transceiver look like?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Complicated walkie-talkie.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Hey! Can you hear me?  I need that water.  Here. Here you go. Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 PILOT: How many survived?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: At least 48. Does anything feel broken?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 PILOT: No, no. Just my head's a little dizzy, that's all.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Yeah. It's probably a concussion.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 PILOT: How long has it been?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Sixteen hours.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 PILOT: Sixteen? Has anybody come?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Not yet.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 PILOT: Six hours in, our radio went out. No-one could see us. We turned back to land in Fiji. By the time we hit turbulence, we … we were a thousand miles off course. They're looking for us in the wrong place.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 PILOT: We have a transceiver.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Good. Good, that's what we were hoping. Listen, you shouldn't try to move.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 PILOT: No, no. I'm okay. It's okay. Transceiver's right there. It's right there.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  Where's Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 PILOT: It's not working.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE:  Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: What were you doing in the bathroom?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 PILOT: What the hell was that?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: It's right outside.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 PILOT: What, what's right outside?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Shhhh.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: What the hell just happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Jack, come on!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Just leave it!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE:  Hey!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: Okay, let's run.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE:  J-J-J... Jaaaack!  One! Two! Three! Four! Five!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Kate!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Where the hell is Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: I don't know!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Did you see him?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Yeah, he pulled me up!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Where is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: I don't know!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: How can you not know?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: We got separated! Look, I … I fell down, and he, he came back for me, that thing was just…
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Did you see it?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: No. No! But it was right there. We were dead! I was. An-And then Jack came back, and he, he pulled me up. I don't know where he is.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: We have to go back for him.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Go back? There? Kate, there's a certain gargantuan quality about this thing.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Then don't come.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: Kate!
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: I heard you shout. I heard you shout "Jack". I'm Charlie, by the way.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: What is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE: What is...
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK:  It's the pilot.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 KATE: Did you see it?
Lost.Season01.Episode01 JACK: No. It was right behind me, but... I dove into the bushes.
Lost.Season01.Episode01 CHARLIE:  Guys? How does something like that happen?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Anything?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: You keep asking if there's anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Pardon me for appearing desperate, but before the pilot was ripped from the cockpit, he did say that no-one's going to find us unless we … get that transceiver working. So... is there anything?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE:  What were you doing? In the bathroom?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: I thought you could tell. I was getting sick. Puking. My one tangible contribution to the trek.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: No. I'm glad you came. Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Every trek needs a coward.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: You're not a coward.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CINDY: You all right, sir?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: I'm good. Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CINDY: Can I get you a water, or…
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE:  I'm fine. Thank you. Please?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CINDY:  All right.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Excuse me.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 ROSE: Guess he really had to go.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CINDY: Sir, excuse me!  Sir, excuse me!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON:  Excuse me?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CINDY: Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JD:  Sir, are you all right?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Just a minute.  Just a minute.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JD: I'm gonna have to ask that you open the door, please.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JD: Open the door now, sir. Sir!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: Hey. We're going through some clothes. Sorting them. I see you found your bag. Come on, you want to give us a hand?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: Not really. You're wasting your time. They're coming.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CLAIRE:  Is that your boyfriend?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: My brother. Boone. God's friggin' gift to humanity.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CLAIRE: I used to have a stomach.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: You know what it is?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CLAIRE: Not yet. I haven't felt the baby move since yesterday.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: Uh, excuse me. Hey, uh … have you, uh ... have you seen my boy?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SUN: 죄송해요. 저 영어 못 해요. 아 … 저, 제가 영어를 못 해요.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JIN: 윗 단추가 열렸네. 채워라. 빨리!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: I'm sorry.  Walt! Walt?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 WALT: Vincent! Vincent! Come here, boy!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL:  Hey! What did I tell you? After everything that's happened!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 WALT: I thought that maybe Vincent would be around!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: I told you to stay on the beach!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 WALT: This is so close to the beach, I thought this would be okay…
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: Don't do that. You listen to me. I mean what I say. You understand?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: What is this?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 WALT: I just found it.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL:  Come here.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: Hey guys. Come on, man. Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Hey. Break it up. Break it up! Come on! That's it! It's over! That's it!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Son of a bitch!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: I'm sick of this redneck!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: You want some more of me, boy?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Tell everyone what you told me! Tell them that I crashed the plane! Go on! Tell them I made the plane crash!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: The shoe fits, buddy!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: What is going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Ibn Al-Kalb!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL:  Look, my kid found these in the jungle.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: And this guy was sitting in the back row of business class, the whole flight, never got up. Hands folded underneath the blanket.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Oh.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: And for some reason - just pointin' this out - the guy sittin' next to him didn't make it.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Thank you so much for observing my behavior.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: You don't think I saw them pull you out of line before we boarded?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Come on, bring it!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE:  Stop!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: We found the transceiver, but it's not working. Can anybody help?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Yes. I might be able to.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Oh great. Perfect! Let's trust this guy!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: Hey! We're all this together, man. Let's treat each other with a little respect.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Shut up, Lardo.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Hey! Give it a break.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Whatever you say, doc. You're the hero.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: You guys found the cockpit?  Any survivors?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID:  It's dual band, military spec. Chances are, the battery is good, but - the radio is dead.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Can you fix it?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: I need some time.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 ROSE:  Doctor, the... man with the shrapnel, I... I think you should take a look at him.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: Tsss. Chain-smoking jackass...
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Some people have problems.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: Tsss. Some people have problems? Us. Him. You're okay. I like you.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: You're okay, too.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY:  Hurley.  Uh, just…
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID:  Sayid.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: How do you know to do all that?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: I was a military communications officer.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: Oh yeah? You ever see battle?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: I fought in the Gulf War.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: No way! I got a buddy who fought over there. He was in the 104th airborne. What were you - Air Force... Army?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: The Republican Guard.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SUN: 실례합니다. 준비 다 됐나 봐요. 당신을 찾아요.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Is it working?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Seems to be. Except we're not picking up a signal.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Why do we need to pick up a signal? Aren't we trying to send one?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Yes, but what you want to see here is little bars. The bars would show the radio is getting reception.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: We need the bars.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: We could broadcast blind... Hope that someone—maybe a ship somewhere—picks up our distress call. But that could be a waste of the battery, which might not last that long. There is one thing we could try...
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Seeing if we can get a signal from high ground.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: How high?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: How is he? Can you do anything?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Pull out the shrapnel.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: But you said yesterday that if you took it out...
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: I know. But that was yesterday. I was hoping he'd be at a hospital by now. If I leave him like this, he'll be dead within a day. If I open him up... if I can control the bleeding and if he doesn't go into sepsis and if I can find some antibiotics... he might be all right.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: I'm going on a hike.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Sorry?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Sayid fixed the transceiver, but we can't use it. Not from here.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Kate, wait a minute.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: You're the one who said that we had to send out a signal.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Look, you saw what that thing did to the pilot.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Yeah, I did. What makes you think we're any safer here than we are in the jungle?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Wait for me. I don't know how long this will be... 
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Sayid said the batteries won't last.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: All right. If you see, or hear, anything... Anything. Run.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: What's that? What, that? What, eat that?  Dude. Dude. I'm... starving... But, I'm nowhere near that hungry.  No. No. No, thank you! No way, no. 
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: The comic's in Spanish. You... read Spanish?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 WALT: No. I found it.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: Tell you what: We get home... I get you another dog.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Hey! I need your help.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: I need you to help me go through the luggage. I need any kind of prescription medications you can find. Especially drugs that end in -mycin and -cillin. Those are antibiotics.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: What's this for?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: I think I was mean to him.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: Isn't that the guy from the gate? He wouldn't let us have our seats in first class. He saved our lives.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: Come on, Shannon, we're trying to clear some of the wreckage. You should help out. You're just being worthless over here.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: I'm being what?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: What do you want me to say? You're sitting on your ass staring at bodies.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: I've just been through a trauma here, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: We've all been through a trauma. The only difference is, since the crash, you've actually given yourself a pedicure.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: You know what? It is so easy to make fun of me, and you're good at it. I get it.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: I wish I didn't have to waste my time making fun of you. I wish I didn't have a reason. Yeah, it is easy, Shannon.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: Screw you, you do not have the slightest idea what I am thinking.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: I have a much better idea than you think I do.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: No, you don't!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: Okay, Shannon. Then what are you thinking?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: I'm going with them. On the hike.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: Yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: Yup. I'm going.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: No, you're not, Shannon. Shannon!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON:  I'd like to come with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: She's not going. She doesn't want to go.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: The hell I'm not.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: It's what she does. She postures.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: You don't know what the hell I do!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: Makes really bad decisions to upset her family, which, at the moment, is me.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: Shut up, and stop trying to be charming.  I'm coming with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: I don't... know if that's such a good idea.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: What are you? Two years older than me? Please.  You're going, aren't you?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Yeah, are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: Yup.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Yeah, I'm definitely going.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Look, everybody can come. But we're leaving now.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE:  You couldn't tell from that, but she's actually really nice.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: You decided to join us.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: I'm a complex guy, sweetheart.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: What you're looking for?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Some sort of blade. How's your son?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: Walt? Yeah, I think he'll be all right.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: How old is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: Nine... Ten—Ten. Walt's more worried about his dog than anything. The dog was on the plane, so... Kids, you know.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Is it a Lab?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Yeah? I saw him yesterday, in the jungle.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHAEL: What? Where?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Over there. Couple hundred yards in or so. He looked good.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 WALT: What is it, like checkers?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 LOCKE: Not really, it's a better game than... checkers. You play checkers with your Pop?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 WALT: No. I live in Australia with my mom.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 LOCKE: You have no accent.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 WALT: Yeah, I know. We move a lot. She got sick. She died a couple of weeks ago.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 LOCKE: You're having a bad month.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 WALT: I guess.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 LOCKE: Backgammon is the oldest game in the world. Archeologists found sets when they excavated the ruins of ancient Mesopotamia. Five thousand years old. That's older than Jesus Christ.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 WALT: Did they have dice and stuff?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 LOCKE:  Mhhm. But theirs weren't made of plastic. Their dice were made of bones.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 WALT: Cool.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 LOCKE: Two players. Two sides. One is light... one is dark. Walt, do you want to know a secret?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CLAIRE: No. Tha- thank you. No, it's okay.  No, really. Okay. Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CLAIRE: Oh, gosh. I just felt it. I ju … Come here, feel this. Please. . Please. Please. Do you feel that? There! Right there, that's a kick! There! There, right there's a foot! Oh no, he's, wait, he's moving around. "He". "He". I guess I think you're a "he".
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Okay! Wide open space! You should check the radio, see if we're good.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: We're not going to have any reception here.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Just try it.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: I don't want to waste the batteries.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: I'm not asking you to keep it on all day.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: We're still blocked by the mountain.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Just check the damn radio!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: If I just check.. we might not have any juice left when we get to...
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: My god.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: What the hell's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Something's coming.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: It's coming towards us, I think.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Come on, let's move.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: I shouldn't have come. Aah!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Go! Go!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE:  Sawyer!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID:  Let him go!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: That's... that's a big bear.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: You think that's what killed the pilot?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: No. No, that's a tiny, teeny version compared to that.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Guys, this isn't just a... bear. That's a polar bear.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: You sure he's out?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: He's out.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: How do you know he won't wake up when you yank that thing out?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: I don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: Hey, guy, are you awake? Yo, there's a rescue plane! We're saved! Yaaay!  Yeah, he's out. So—what do you want me...
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Look, it's unlikely that he'll regain consciousness. But the pain might bring him around. And if it does, I need you to hold him down.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: Uh... I'm not so good around blood, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Then don't look.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: Yeah. But.. I'm not so good around blood.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Just do the best you can. Okay? Don't look.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: Okay .
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: Dude.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Hand me those strips.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: Dude.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Just hand me the strips, I need to get this bleeding stopped.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: I don't think I can.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Oh.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 HURLEY: "Oh" what? What, what's going on, something in there? 
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: The strips. Just hand me the strips. Give it to me.  Don't even think about it, Hurley. Don't even think a... Hurley! Hey!  Damn it!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: That can't be a polar bear.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID and KATE:  It's a polar bear.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: Yeah, but... Polar bears don't usually live in the jungle.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Spot on.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: No, polar bears don't live near this far south.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: This one does.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Did. It did.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE:  Where did that come from?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Probably Bear Village. How the hell do I know?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Not the bear. The gun.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: I got if off one of the bodies.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: One of the bodies.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Yeah, one of the bodies.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: People don't carry guns on planes.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: They do if they're a US Marshal, sweet cheeks. There was one on the plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: How do you know that?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: I saw a guy lying there with an ankle holster, so I took the gun. I thought it might come in handy. Guess what? I just shot a bear!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: So why do you think he's a Marshal?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Because he had a clip-on badge.  I took that too. Thought it was cool.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: I know who you are. You're the prisoner.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: I'm the what?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: You found a gun on a US Marshal. Yes, I believe you did. You knew where it was, because you were the one he was bringing back to the States. Those handcuffs were on you. That's how you knew there was a gun.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Piss off.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: That's who you are, you son of a bitch.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Be as suspicious of me as I am of you.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: But you are the prisoner.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Fine! I'm the criminal. You're the terrorist. We can all play a part.  Who do you want to be?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Does anybody know how to use a gun?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: I think you just pull the trigger.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Don't use the gun.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: I want to take it apart.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Oh.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: There's a button on the grip. Push that, it will eject the magazine.  There's still a round in the chamber. Hold the grip, pull the top part of the gun.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER:  I know your type.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: I'm not so sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Yeah. I've been with girls like you.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: No girl's exactly like me.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHELLE: Can I get you a refill?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: No, I'm... I'm fine with this, thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHELLE: You, sir? Can I get you anything? Cocktail? Soda?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MARSHAL: Just coffee, sweetheart. Black.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MICHELLE:  Coffee. Sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MARSHAL: You look worried. I'd be worried too, I was you. But you've got to stay positive, kiddo. You know, there's always that off chance that they'll believe your story. I know I sure do.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: I don't care what you believe.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MARSHAL: Oh, I know. That's true. That has always been true. You sure you don't want some more juice?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Yeah, I'm sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CINDY:  Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has switched on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: I have one favor to ask.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MARSHAL: Really? This ought to be good. What...
Lost.Season01.Episode02 [The turbulence causes the big drop with a woman hitting the ceiling. A big black/silver case hits the Marshal on the head. He passes out. The masks come down and Kate can't reach because of the handcuffs. She gets the key from the Marshal's pocket and unlocks the handcuffs. She puts her mask on and then puts a mask on the Marshal. The back of the plane rips off.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: We should keep moving.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: No. No.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 MARSHAL: Where is she?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 JACK: Who?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Oh! Now's a good time to check the radio! Not before.. but now!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: We're up higher.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Yes, we are!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Bar. Hey! We've got a bar! Mayday! Mayday! 
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: What is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Feedback.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Feedback from what? What would do that?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: I'll tell you what would do that. This guy not fixing the radio. This thing doesn't even work.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: No. No, no, no, no, it's not broken. We can't transmit because something else is already transmitting.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Transmitting from where?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Somewhere close. The signal's strong.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Somewhere close? You mean on the Island? That's great!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: Maybe it's other survivors.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: From our plane? How would they even—
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: What kind of transmission is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Could be a sat phone, maybe a radio signal...
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Can we listen to it?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Let me get the frequency first. Hold on.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: There's no transmission.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Shut up.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: The rescue party. It has to be. . It's French! The French are coming! I've never been so happy to hear the French!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: I never took French. What does she say?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: D-Does anybody speak French?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: She does.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: No, I don't. What?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: What the hell are you talking about? You spent a year in Paris!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: Drinking, not studying!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 RADIO: Iteration 7294531.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Okay. What's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: "No, no, no" what?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: What "no"?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: The-the batteries are dying!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: How much time do we have?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Not much.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: I've heard you speak French! Just listen to this! Listen to it!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: I can't!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: You speak French or not? Because that would be nice.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 RADIO: Iteration 17294532.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: That voice is weird. What is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: Come on. Come on, Shannon!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Come on!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID:  Come on!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: It's... it's repeating.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: She's right.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: It's a loop. "Iteration"—it's repeating the same message. It's a counter. The next number will end... "533".
Lost.Season01.Episode02 RADIO: Iteration 17294533.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Does anyone know what the hell he's talking about?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: It's a running count of the number of times the message has repeated. It's roughly thirty seconds long, so... how long... .
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Don't forget to carry the one, chief.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 RADIO: Iteration 17294534.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON: She's saying .. "Please". She's saying, "Please help me. Please, come get me."
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: Or she's not! You don't even speak French!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Let her listen!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: Shut up, man!
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Guys, the battery. The battery.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 RADIO: Iteration 17294535.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SHANNON:  I'm alone now. Uhm... On the Island alone. Please, someone come. The others, they're... they're dead. I-it killed them. I-it killed them all.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: That was good.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Sixteen years.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: Sixteen years. And five months. That's the count.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: What the hell are you talking about?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAYID: The iterations. It's a distress call. A plea for help. A mayday. If the count is right... It's been playing over... and over... for sixteen years.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 BOONE: Someone else? Was stranded here?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 KATE: Maybe they came for them.
Lost.Season01.Episode02 SAWYER: If someone came, why is it still playing?
Lost.Season01.Episode02 CHARLIE: Guys. Where are we?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: Don't trust her. She's dangerous.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: You should try not to move, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: Have to find her. Have to bring her back.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Yeah, you keep saying that. And every time I ask you who you have to bring back you pass out on me again. Since your fever's running pretty high, I'm guessing you have no idea who you're talking about.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: My cuffs, my handcuffs. Where are my cuffs?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: My jacket pocket.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: I don't...
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: Jacket pocket.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: Dangerous. She's dangerous.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 BOONE: It's getting dark.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Then pick up the pace.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 BOONE: Hick.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Little louder?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: We should make camp.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SHANNON: What, here?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: Yes, here.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: I'm not stopping. You all have a nice cookout.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: Excellent, walk through the jungle in the dark.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Oooo, afraid the trees are going to get us?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: No, what is knocking down the trees will get you.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER:  Well, if you're so worried about me, how about you give me the clip back?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Put the gun back in your pants, Sawyer. Sayid's right, if you keep walking you're not going to make it to the beach.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Yeah, why's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Trust me.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: This is Australia . This is us .
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Nice stick.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: Two days ago we take off from Sydney. We fly along the same north east route every commercial airliner bound for Los Angeles does. Now the pilot, he said he lost communication with the ground, correct?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Yeah, 6 hours in. He turned around and headed for Fiji.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: So, we changed course. Regrettably, no one knew we changed course. The turbulence hit. We know the rest. 
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: The pilot said we were over a thousand miles off course.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: Yeah, but, they'll find us. They have satellites in space that can take pictures of your license plate.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: If only we were all wearing license plates.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: Well, aren't you the pessimist.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: Basic photography - point and shoot. Satellites can shoot, but they must be told where to point.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: Oh. Bollocks.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Okay, really enjoyed the puppet show. Fantastic. But we're stuck in the middle of damn nowhere. How about we talk about that other thing? You know that transmission Abdul picked up on his little radio? The French chick that said, "They're all dead." The transmission's been on a loop for … how long was it, Freckles?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: 16 years.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Right. Let's talk about that.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 BOONE: Well, we have to tell the others when we get back.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SHANNON: Tell them what, exactly?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 BOONE: What we heard.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SHANNON: You didn't hear anything. I'm not a stupid translator.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: No one's going to tell them anything. To relay what we heard without fully understanding it will cause a panic. If we tell them what we know we take away their hope. And hope is a very dangerous thing to lose.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: So we lie.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: Was it a dinosaur?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: It wasn't a dinosaur.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: You say you didn't see it.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: I didn't.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: So how do you know it wasn't a dinosaur?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Because dinosaurs are extinct.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: Oh. Yeah.  So what's his story? He looks kind of... dying.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: He's not going to die.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: He's yellow, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: His wound is infected, but the antibiotics will fight it off.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: What if they don't?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Then his body will shut down one piece at a time. His abdomen goes rigid, then...
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: He looks like he's in pain.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: What's this? Uh, dude? Uh...  What do you think she did?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: It's none of my business.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: She looks pretty hard core.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Hurley... 
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 BOONE:  Standing guard. You heard what they said is out there.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: You took my gun off me, boy?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SHANNON:  Please, you've never even held a gun.  He doesn't believe in guns. He's goes on marches.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 BOONE: I don't go on marches.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: Give it back to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Yeah, give it to Al Jazeera, he'll protect us.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: Al Jazeera is a network.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 BOONE: I'll keep the damn gun.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SHANNON: We should give it to her. 
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: Yeah, Kate should hold the gun.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: Fine with me. Well?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: Good morning.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Morning.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: You were sleeping in my sheep pen.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: How'd you get here?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I walked.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: You walked?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: From where?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Town.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: Nearest town's 15 kilometers.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Maybe that's why I was so exhausted.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: What's your name?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Annie.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: You hungry, Annie?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: So you want to tell me why you're trespassing on my property?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I ran out of money.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: You're an American.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Canadian. I graduated from college and figured I'd see the world. Australia was top of my list so I hopped a flight to Melbourne but I don't know anybody here so I figured I'd walk for awhile, you know.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: Melbourne's 100 kilometers from here.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I like walking.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: And you just happened to wonder onto my farm.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I like farms, too.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: Do you know how to work one?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: My wife died 8 months ago Wednesday. She left me with too many chores and a hell of a mortgage. If you help me with the first one, I'll give you a fair wage and a place to stay.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Deal.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: No. I'm a lefty.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: Dude, dude, they're back.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: As you and the others know, we hiked up the mountain in an attempt to help the rescue team locate us. The transceiver failed to pick up a signal. We weren't able to send out a call for help.  But we're not giving up. If we gather electronic equipment - your cell phones, laptops - I can boost the signal and we can try again, but that may take some time. So for now, we should begin rationing our remaining food. If it rains, we should set up tarps to collect water. I need to organize 3 separate groups. Each group should have a leader.  One group for water - I'll organize that. Who's going to organize electronics?  You? Rationing food? Okay. And I believe a third group should concern themselves with the construction of...
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Hi.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I, um, I need to tell you something.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Okay, sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: We couldn't send out a signal because there was another signal blocking it. The other signal - we heard it. It was a distress call from a French woman. She said that the others were dead - something had killed them all. She was alone on the Island. It's been playing for 16 years, Jack. I wanted to tell you.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Anything else?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE:  How is he - the man with the shrapnel in his side?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: It's touch-and-go.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: He wake up?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: No, just for a few seconds during the surgery.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: He say anything?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: So what'd she say?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: She didn't say anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: But you told her you knew?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: I don't know anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: Well, you kind of know she's in that mug shot. And that we found those handcuffs. And that guy keeps mumbling "she's dangerous, she's dangerous" over and over.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: It's not my business. Not my problem.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: Yeah, you're right. We'll let Johnny Fever take care of her when he gets better.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: He's not getting better if we don't get some stronger antibiotics.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: That stuff I got from the luggage...
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: It's for ear infections and foot fungus.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: We went through everything, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: What about that luggage in the overhead compartments?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: That's inside the plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: But, the bodies are in there, and they're all... dead.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Look, I'll handle it. Why don't you keep an eye on him...?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: Great. Yeah - love to - on it.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Boo.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK:  What are you doing in here?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Trick or treat, same as you.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: You're looting.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Aww, you say potato...
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: What's in the bag?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Booze, smokes, couple of Playboys. What's in yours?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Medicine.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Well, that about sums it up, don't it?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Do you do this back home, too - steal from the dead?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Brother, you've to got wake up and smell the bull crap here, rescue ain't comin'. You're just wasting your time. You're trying to save a guy who last time I checked had a piece of metal the size of my head sticking out of his bread basket. Let me ask you something? How many of those pills are you going to use to fix him up?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: As many as it takes.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Yeah? How many you got? You're just not looking at the big picture, Doc. You're still back in civilization.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Yeah? And where are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Me? I'm in the wild.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: Whoa, hey, I got it. I got it.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CLAIRE: Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: Well, look on the bright side. Whoever's this was is probably better off than we are. I got it.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SUN: 여기… 당신 가방 찾은 것 같아요! 
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JIN: 그래? 보자. 아니야. 
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SUN: 그럼 계속 찾아볼게요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JIN: 잠깐, 이리 와 봐. 니 모습 좀 봤니? 니 옷하고 얼굴이 너무 더러워 보여. 빨리 씻어라. 자기야. 사랑해. 
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: So, how's the baby?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CLAIRE: It's okay, I think.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: Good. So, your husband. Was he on the flight?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CLAIRE: Oh, no. I'm not married.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: Oh.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CLAIRE: I know - how modern of me.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: Well, who needs men, right? Bloody useless.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CLAIRE:  So, you guys hiked all the way up that mountain for nothing, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Hey, sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: I was going to get some more water.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: We haven't met. I'm Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: Hi, Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Hi.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: Hurley.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I was just looking for Jack and I thought he might be in there.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: Yeah, no. Uh, he went to go get some medicine... over there.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Where? In the fuselage?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: What? Yeah, in the uh, uh, you know? I've got to get that water. 
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: The bank would have given you a heck of a toaster if you had kept that in a savings account.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: What do I need a toaster for?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: You're hiding your wages in a tin can, Annie. I mean, I would have held on to it for you.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I got trust issues.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: Weren't you going to say goodbye?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Wrote you a note.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: You've been here almost 3 months, Annie. And every time I ask you about yourself, you get that look in your eye. Yeah, that one. So, I mind my own business. I figured maybe you got off on the wrong side of a bad relationship. Maybe you ran. I always knew you'd leave here someday. I guess I hoped it wouldn't be in the middle of the night.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: Yeah, so am I.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: Hey, Annie, why don't you just stay one more night, eh? I'll drive you to the train station first thing in the morning. I promise.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: I get it, you know. Everyone deserves a fresh start.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 Jack: Damn it. Damn it.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Just breathe. Come on, come on, look, look at me, look.  What did you do?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I was just checking to if he was... he jumped on me. He grabbed me. Is he... okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: He's not responding to antibiotics, he's bleeding internally, his fever's pushing 104. And his abdomen's rigid. He needs water.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: So, what are you going to do about it?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: About what?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: About him.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: I told you, he needs water.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Will he suffer?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Will it be quick?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: No. It won't be quick. 2, 3, maybe 4 days.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: And he'll feel it?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Yeah, he'll feel it.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Can't you put him out of his misery?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: I saw your mug shot, Kate. I am not a murderer.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: Do they listen to Patsy Cline in Canada?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: They listen to Patsy Cline everywhere.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: You hungry?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I'll eat on the train.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: You sure? There's a little place up here that makes a mean burger.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: What are you looking for, Ray?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: How long have you known?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: Couple of days. I saw your picture in the post office. I guess they knew you were Down Under.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE:  Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 RAY: The reward's 23,000 dollars. I told you when I met you, I've got a hell of a mortgage. If it makes you feel any better, it was a hard decision, Annie.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: My name's not Annie.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: Hey, who was that guy you were hanging out with?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 WALT: What guy?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: The bald guy.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 WALT: Oh, Mr. Locke?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: Mr. Locke got any kids?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 WALT: He didn't say.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: Yeah, what did he say?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 WALT: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: What do you mean you don't know. What did he say?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 WALT: Some of it's secret.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: Did he tell you not to tell me?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 WALT: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: Then what's the secret?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 WALT: Mr. Locke said a miracle happened to him.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: Yeah, well, a miracle happened to all of us, Walt. We survived a plane crash. Look, I don't want you hanging around with him anymore.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 WALT: Why not? He's my friend.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: Hey, I'm your friend, too.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 WALT: If you were my friend, you'd find Vincent.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: Walt, look, I haven't given up on your dog. I'm going to do everything I can to find him.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 WALT: No you won't.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: Yeah, Walt, I will.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 WALT: You don't care about Vincent.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: I'm going to get your dog back as soon as it stops raining. Hey listen to me, I'm going to get your dog back. 
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL:  Yeah, soon as it stops raining - good, nice. I'm going to find your dog... yeah, I'm just going to go walking through the haunted damn jungle looking for your...  Vincent?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: Vincent? That you buddy?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: Oh. Something was chasing me so, uh.. I don't hear it now. But you should probably head back.  Uh, I didn't see anything, you know, if you're worried about it... I didn't see anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: What are you making?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 LOCKE: Whistle.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 CHARLIE: I used some tribal flutes once in a recording session. I'm in a band.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SHANNON: I wish he would just die already.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 BOONE: Real humane, Shannon.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: Anything I can do to help?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: No, I'm good, thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: The others are getting upset. They want to know what's going on inside the tent.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Trying to save his life.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAYID: Rumor has it you can't.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Need a light?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Came by to thank you. You going to ask what for?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: What for?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: For taking that gun away from me.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I didn't take it away from you.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: It's sticking out of your denims, ain't it? I sure wouldn't want to be the one with that gun right now. Because everyone sitting out there listening to that poor boy scream all night knows what's got to be done. Only one that can do it is the one with that gun. Don't act so surprised. I heard you tell the hero the same thing. Hell, there's only one bullet left - be damned near poetic.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: Listen to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: No, you need to keep quiet.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: Listen to me, no matter what she does - no matter how she makes you feel, don't you trust a word that she says. She will do anything to get away.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: What did she do?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: I want to talk to her.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Tell me what she did.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: I want to talk to her, alone.  She got to you, too, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL:  Hey, Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: What was it?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: The favor.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I don't know what you're talking about.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: The last thing I heard before the crash - you wanted a favor.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I have one favor to ask.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: Really? This ought to be good.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL:  Well?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I wanted you to make sure that Ray Mullen got his 23 grand.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: What—the guy who ratted you out?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: He had a hell of a mortgage.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: You really are one of a kind. You know, you would have got away if you hadn't saved him.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: In case you hadn't noticed, I did get away.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: You don't look free to me. Kate, I'm going to die, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MARSHAL: So, are you going to do it, or what?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: Yo, so, where's the fugitive?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: In the tent.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: You let her in there alone?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: What's she going to do? She's 120 pounds soaking wet.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: Yeah, but she's got that gun.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: She's strapped, man. I saw it in her... in her... in her... in her...
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Kate?!
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: What did you do?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: What you couldn't. Look, I get where you're coming from being a doctor and all, but he wanted it. Hell, he asked me. So, I don't like it any more than you do, but something had to be done.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY: Oh, no way. Guys?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: You shot him in the chest?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: I was aiming for his heart.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: You missed.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY:  Man, is he still breathing?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: You perforated his lung. It'll take hours to bleed out.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: So what is—I only had one bullet.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Get out. Get out!
Lost.Season01.Episode03 HURLEY:  Oh boy.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 SAWYER: Damn it!
Lost.Season01.Episode03 LOCKE: I found your son's dog.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode03 LOCKE: Vincent-I tethered him to a tree just over there. I know that Walt lost his mom. I thought that you should be the one to bring his dog back to him.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 MICHAEL: Hey, thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 LOCKE: Welcome.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: I want to tell you what I did - why he was after me.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: I don't want to know. It doesn't matter, Kate, who we were - what we did before this, before the crash. It doesn't really... 3 days ago we all died. We should all be able to start over.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 KATE: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode03 JACK: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Walt, you gotta keep that dog quiet.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: I don't know what's wrong with him. Come on, Vincent, cut that out.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Sorry, hey, sorry, sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: What is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: Somebody's in there.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: Everyone in there's dead.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER: Right behind you, Jackass.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER: I'm gonna shed some light on this thing.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Run.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HURLEY: Oh crud, now what?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: They're gone.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: What the bloody hell was that?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Boars. 
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Those boars were looking to feed. We have to get rid of the bodies.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: Bury them? There's a whole bunch in there.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: More than twenty. Digging will be difficult without shovels.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: We're not burying them. We need to burn them.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: They're people.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: I know they're people, Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: Burning the remains, they deserve better than that.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Better than what? Being eaten by wild animals? Because that's what's going to happen. Any bodies we bury are not going to stay buried for very long. Look, I know this seems harsh, but that fuselage in the sun—it's not about what they deserve. They're gone, and we're not.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: What you say may be true, but for us to decide how these people are laid to rest—it's not right. No regard for their wishes? Their religions?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: We don't have time to sort out everybody's god.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: Really, last I heard we were positively made of time.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Look, I'm not happy about it either, but we crashed a thousand miles off course. They're looking for us in the wrong place. It's been 4 days, no one's come. Tomorrow morning we need everyone to start gathering up wood, dried brush, and turn that fuselage into a furnace. Wait until the sun goes down tomorrow night before we start the fire.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: If he's so eager to burn the bodies why are we waiting until sundown?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: He's hoping someone will see it.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Looks like I'm not the only who couldn't sleep last night.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: There are better things to do with my time than collect firewood.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: You don't agree with Jack. What are you making?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: Too soon to talk about. I'm not sure it will even work.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: You're trying to pick up the transmission aren't you? The one we heard on the transceiver.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: If the French woman's transmission has truly been playing on a loop for 16 years then there must be a power source on the Island. A significant one.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: And you can find it?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: Hypothetically, yes. I'm making an antenna of sorts. With a few of these mounted at different points on the Island I may be able to use the transceiver to triangulate the signal, find out where it's coming from.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: So what can I do to help?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: It appears you are as anxious to get off this Island as I am.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT:  Catch the ball, catch the ball, Vincent. Good boy, good job Vincent.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Hey, hey, where you going, man?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: Nowhere, I just thought I'd see what Mr. Locke was doing.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Hey, why don't you help your dad with the wood. I'm sure Mr. Locke doesn't want a kid hanging around him all day anyway.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: At least he talks to me. Come on, Vincent.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HURLEY: What's your problem? Hand them over.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER: How about no?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HURLEY: There's other people here or don't you give a crap?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER: Well if one of us wouldn't eat more than his fair share...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HURLEY: Oh that's bull and you know it. You're not happy unless you're screwing over everybody...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER: Hey I'm peachy, pork pie.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK:  Guys, knock it off.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER: Stay out of this, Metro.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HURLEY: Jethro here's hoarding the last of the peanuts.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER: My own stash. I found it in there.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: What about the rest of the food?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HURLEY: There is no rest of the food, dude. We kind of—ate it all.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Okay everybody, just calm down.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: We can find food. There are plenty of things on this Island we can use for sustenance.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER:  And exactly how are we going to find this sustenance.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: We hunt.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: How'd you get that knife on the plane?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Checked it.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK:  You either have very good aim, or very bad aim, Mr...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Locke. His name is Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Okay Mr. Locke, what is it that we're hunting?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: We know there are wild boar on the Island. Razorbacks, by the look of them. The ones that came into the camp last night were piglets, 100, 150 pounds each. Which means that there's a mother nearby. A 250 pound rat, with scimitar-like tusks, and a surly disposition, who'd love nothing more than to eviscerate anything that comes near. Boar's usual mode of attack is to circle around and charge from behind so I figure it'll take at least three of us to distract her long enough for me to flank one of the piglets, pin it, and slit its throat.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER:  And you gave him his knife back?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Well, if you've got a better idea.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER: Better than the three of you wandering into the magic forest to bag a hunk of ham with nothing but a little bitty hunting knife? Hell no, it's the best idea I ever heard.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HURLEY: Who is this guy?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Yes?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 GL12: Colonel Locke, is this line secure?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Line secure GL12, go ahead.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 GL12: Target area is acquired. Maneuvers are a go for 1300 hours. Repeat: we are a GO.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Roger that. We'll convene at the usual rendezvous point at 1300 hours.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 RANDY:  Locke. I told you I need those TPS reports done by noon today. Not 12:30; not 12:15; noon.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: I heard you the first time, Randy.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 RANDY: And no personal calls during office hours, Colonel.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: So? Hunting boar, now, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Who says it's my first time boar hunting?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Uh-huh. Tell me something, how come every time there's a hike into the heart of darkness you sign up? You know what's in there.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Actually, I don't. And neither do you.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: What's your feel on our new friend?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Seems to know what he's doing.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Call me paranoid, but anyone who packs a suitcase full of knives?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: If I didn't know any better, I'd say your worried about me, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: If I didn't know any better, I'd say you have a problem staying in one place for very long, Kate. So, you want to tell me why you're really going?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE:  Sayid gave me this so he can triangulate the distress signal we heard—find the source.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: This isn't about boars.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: I'm a vegetarian.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: But why can't I come?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Because I said so.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL:  Hi, hi, excuse me. Um, I am going off, away, to hunt, and um, I was wondering if you could keep an eye on my boy, Walt. And, I'm Michael. Anyway, could you watch him for me, until I come back?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SUN: 아... 아드님은 제가 잘 돌보고 있을게요. 예...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Sorry I don't understand, but you're cool with this, right? 
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: I don't need a babysitter.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Come on, Vincent needs you here. And, hey, cheer up. This will give me a chance to get to know your friend Mr. Locke a little better.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SUN: 너무 걱정하지 마. 아버지 괜찮으실 거야.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: Yeah, whatever.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: Excuse me. Doctor?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Claire, right? How's the .
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: Oh, he's good, yeah, thanks. Um, I thought maybe you should see this . Someone found it in there. They're collecting all the belongings. They're wedding plans for Steve and Kristin. They were on the plane sitting a couple of rows behind me. I remember because they looked so happy.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: I don't understand, Claire, what am I supposed to do with this?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: Oh, well, um, some of us were wondering if maybe we should do some kind of memorial service, or something. You could lead it.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Uh, no, I don't think it...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: Well, you know, just a few words, or we could just read their names from passports, and drivers...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Look, it's not my thing.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: Oh, okay. Maybe I'll do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Yeah, sounds fine. Whatever everybody wants.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE:  That woman's still sitting there.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON:  Mmmhmmm.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: Her husband was on the plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: Right.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: Are you even listening to me?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: What's a four letter word for I don't care?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: I just think somebody should go talk to her.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: I nominate you, Captain America. You just can't help yourself, can you?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: Yeah, well, at least you don't have to worry about starving with me taking care of you.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: I'm not going to starve.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: Right, what are you going to eat?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: The ocean's full of fish.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: I hate to break it to you—the ocean is not going to take your gold card.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: You really don't think I can't catch a fish?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: You find something?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: The ground here has been rooted up. That's how boars get the majority of their food, they dig. Afterwards they generally wallow in the dirt, rub up against the trees, scoring them with their tusks.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Okay. So what's all that mean?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Means we're close.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: Hi.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: Hi. (putting the drugs back in his pocket). Shannon, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: Yeah. Are you doing anything?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: Me? No, I was just, uh. What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: I was just going to go for a walk. Do you want to come?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: Yeah, yes, sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: Can I ask you something?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: Oh, I wondered when this was going to come up. Yes, I'm the bass guitarist in Dri…
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: Do you know anything about fishing?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: What? Fishing? My grand-dad used to take me out, taught me everything he knows. Everything he knew, he's dead now, god rest his soul. Yeah, I'm like a … I'm a fishing fiend. I mean England's an island so I just throw it in and … fish.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: Good.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: Hey doc, you got a second?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: What's up?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: The woman's been sitting over there by herself. Maybe she's having trouble dealing with her husband? I don't think she's had anything to eat or drink. Think maybe you can go talk to her?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Why me? I'm not a psychiatrist. I mean, maybe you should...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: I just thought you might want to do it. You're the one that saved her life.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Hi. Rose, right? Remember me, seat 23A? I'm the guy that told you not to worry about the turbulence. Everybody's getting pretty worried about you, Rose. If you want to be alone that's fine, but you have to take care of yourself. You should really drink. Okay. We don't have to talk. Let's just sit for a while.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Your son, how's he handling all of this?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: A hell of a lot better than I am.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: You must be proud. He's a brave kid.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Yeah. I can't take credit for that. I wasn't part of his life. Till his mother passed away, two weeks ago.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: That's okay. There were living in Sydney the past couple of years. I flew out last week, you know, to go get him. What were you doing in Australia?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Shhh.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Hey, quit giving us the steal signal.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: He's bad.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 GL12: Move. You've got to move Col. Your troops are across enemy lines.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Patience, the quality which you lack, GL12, is the hallmark of a leader.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 RANDY: Hallmark, huh? Tell me more about being a leader, Locke. While you're at it, tell me about this Col. thing. I cruised your file in human resources, you've never been in any of the armed forces.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: I'm just playing a game, Randy. It's my lunch hour, I can play a game.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 RANDY: Well, tell me, what's a Walkabout? : "Experience the dream journeys of the fabled Australian Outback."
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: You have no right taking that off my desk.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 RANDY: So, you wander around hunting and gathering food, right? On foot?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Not that you would understand, but a Walkabout is a journey of spiritual renewal, where one derives strength from the earth. And becomes inseparable from it. I have vacation days, I'm going, Randy. I've already made a reservation.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 GL12: Wow. John you're really doing it, huh? You tell Helen yet?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 RANDY: Helen? Well, what's this Locke, you've actually got a woman in your life.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: That's none of your business.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 RANDY: What is it with you Locke? Why do you torture yourself? I mean, imagining you're some hunter? Walkabouts? Wake up, you can't do any of that.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Norman Croucher.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 RANDY: What? Norman what?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Norman Croucher. Norman Croucher, double amputee, no legs. He climbed to the top of Mt. Everest. Why? It was his destiny.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 RANDY: That's what you think you've got, old man? Destiny?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Just don't tell me what I can't do.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE:  He's hurt. John? Can you hear me? Locke? John you okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Locke?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE:  I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine, Helen, I just got the wind knocked out of me is all.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Helen?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: You called me Helen.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Did I?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Which way did that boar go?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Michael's hurt. We have to get him back to camp.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Yeah, you take him back to camp. I'm going to get that boar.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: I'm fine. I can do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: John, you can't.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Don't tell me what I can't do.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: Did you get it?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, quit asking me that.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: Sorry. You, you said you knew how to fish.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HURLEY: Yeah, off the Santa Monica pier with my old man and a fishing pole and bait. Never had to try and poke one with a sharp stick.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: Well, I really appreciate you helping me out, thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HURLEY: Anything to keep me far away from that fuselage and that freakin' redneck jerk.  Damn it, crap, crap, son of a...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: You let me have a go?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HURLEY: Knock yourself out. Okay, here comes one. Put your weight into it. Now, you see it? Wait for it, wait... now. . Dude, you've got to try to pin it.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: You see how close I was? No, you said I had to corner it.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: Excuse me, your name's Sayid, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: I just found this. It's got your name on it. .
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: I thought I'd lost this. Thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: Sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 ROSE: His fingers swell.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Sorry?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 ROSE: Bernard, my husband, his hands swell up whenever we fly.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: The altitude.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 ROSE: He started having me hold onto his wedding ring whenever we took a plane trip. Always wore it around my neck for safe keeping. Just until we landed. You know, doctor, you don't have to keep your promise.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Promise?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 ROSE: The one you gave me on the plane. The one you made me—to keep me company until my husband got back from the restroom. I'm letting you off the hook.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Well, you're not going to get rid of me that easily. Rose, you shouldn't be out here alone. You're suffering from Post Traumatic Shock.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 ROSE: Aren't we all?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Yeah, I guess we are.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 ROSE: You have a nice way about you. A good soul, patient, caring. I suppose that's why you became a doctor.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Thanks but I was just kind of born into it. Family business.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: I have never felt so alive. Getting to finally tell Randy off was... life changing. I mean it, now I'm free to do all those things I ever wanted to do. Things that I know I was destined to do, like we talked about Helen.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HELEN: That's wonderful John. I'm happy for you, really.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: I haven't even told you the best part.  You remember the authentic aboriginal Walkabout?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HELEN: Sure. That's all you've talked about for weeks.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Yeah, well, I'm going to do it. I'm flying to Australia at the end of the week. And I've, uh. I bought two tickets. Helen?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HELEN: John, we've talked about this. I like you and I've enjoyed talking with you these past few months.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: 8 months.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HELEN: I'm not allowed to meet customers.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Customer? Is that what I am to you?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HELEN: This isn't really normal. I mean, it isn't what I do. I don't know, maybe you should find a... I don't know... a therapist?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: I have a therapist.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HELEN: John.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: I thought you understood Helen. You know me better than anyone.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HELEN: John, if we talk any longer, I'm going to have to charge you for another hour. That's another 89.95 and...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Look, I don't care about the money. I just...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HELEN: I'm sorry John, I've got to go.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE:  Helen, Helen. Helen!
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Hey, hey wait a minute. Rest here for a minute.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: I thought the guy with the gimpy leg should be deciding when we rest. What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Trying to boost the transceiver signal. I'm going to climb this tree and attach the antenna.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: You're going to climb that?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Yeah. Don't worry. I've climbed a lot worse.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER:  Hey, uh...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER: These were, um. I found these the other day when I was... Aw hell, just, just take it. 
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: Thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: What is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: Oh, I get it. It's like toothpaste.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SUN:  
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: Chia?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: Dad!
Lost.Season01.Episode04 HURLEY: So, like, what happened out there?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: Dad!
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Hey, hey!
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: Your leg's all messed up. Does it hurt?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: It's okay. It's not as bad as it looks.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAWYER: The mighty huntress returns. What's for dinner, hon-
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Not now.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: So, it was like a boar fight?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Not too much of a fight. It was more like me getting gored.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 WALT: So, um, where's Mr. Locke?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: I don't think that hunt went very well. The bald guy never came back.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: Wait, they didn't bring back any food at all?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: Did you hear what I just said? Somebody might have died out there.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: Well, we're all going to die if somebody doesn't do something.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE:  There you are. As promised, you and I will be dining of fresh catch of the day.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON:  Oh, my fish!
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: I hope you don't mind al fresco. It was no problem. You know what, that one actually gave me a hell of a tussle, but you have to get inside the mind of the fish, you know.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: I don't believe you.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: I got it in the shallows, I cornered it.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON:  What's the matter? Can't stand to see me fending for myself?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE:  I'm sorry about this, seriously.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CHARLIE: No, no, it's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: What are you apologizing to him for?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: For you. For using him—using this poor guy like you use everyone else.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: Oh, whatever.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE: Somewhere in that twisted little brain, you think this proves that you can take care of yourself.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: I told you I'd catch a fish, didn't I?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 BOONE:  That's low Shannon, even for you.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SHANNON: Oh, go rescue a baby bird or something.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Rose, after the sun goes down, we're going to burn the fuselage. It's just something that we have to do. There's going to be a memorial service back at the camp for those—for those who didn't make it. For everyone to say goodbye.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 ROSE: I'd like to be there for that.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Okay. . Maybe if you'd like to say something, you know, about your husband.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 ROSE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: I'm just saying if you wanted to say goodbye to Bernard.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 ROSE: Doctor, my husband is not dead.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Rose, he was in the tail section of the plane. It broke off in mid-flight. I'm sorry, but everyone who was in the rear of the plane's gone.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 ROSE: They're probably thinking the same thing about us.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 ROSE: Doctor? You coming?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: I'm sorry. I guess I should've gotten a warranty.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: I suppose I'll just try again. Of course, I have no welding iron, no rivets, scorched wiring. And it seems I must continue to lie to anyone who asks me what it is I'm actually doing. 
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Sayid, I'll try it again.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID:  We'll try it again.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK:  Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 SAYID: Excuse me. 
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK:  You okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Is this when you say "I told you so?"
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: No, I'm not big on rubbing it in.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Locke, um. Locke's gone. That thing, it was moving in his direction. There wasn't time.  What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: The fuselage is ready to go. Some of the others decided, um … I guess there's going to be some words said over the fire...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: That's good.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: ... names read, I think.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: I just don't think they're ready to hear about some of the things that we've...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: Jack? Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 JACK: Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: Judith Martha Wexler from Denton, TX, guess she was going to catch a connecting flight. Um, she wore corrective lenses and she was an organ donor, or at least would have been. Steve and Kirsten, I don't know their last name, but they were really in love and were going to be married. At least, wherever they are now, they're not alone.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE:  ... video store receipt lists his overdue charges for Willie Wonka and A Little Princess. Looks like he hadn't traveled much... as far as I can tell from his passport.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 KATE: You seen Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: ... Wollstein, Harold, seat 23C.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE:  That's all we have on Harold, his name on a boarding pass... I just wish there was something more... Goodbye, Harold.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Nice work.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: Millicent Louise D'Agostino
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: The boar. Nice work, you know, killing it.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE: ...Teaneck, NJ.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 MICHAEL: Just thought I should say something. So that thing, the monster, whatever. She said it was headed right towards you. Did you see anything? Get any kind of look at it?
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 AGENT: The Walkabouts we arrange here are not just some stroll through the park. It's trekking across vast stretches of desert, rafting bloody treacherous waters.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Look, you've got no idea who you're talking to. I'm well aware of what's involved, believe me. I probably know more than you on the subject.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 AGENT: In any case, it's a trying ordeal for someone in peak physical condition, let alone...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Look, I booked this tour a month ago, you've already got my money. Now, I demand a place on that bus.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 AGENT: You misrepresented yourself...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: I never lied.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 AGENT: By omission, Mr. Locke. You neglected to tell us about your condition.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: My condition is not an issue. I've lived with it for 4 years. It's never kept me from doing anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 AGENT: Look, unfortunately it is an issue for our insurance company. I can't keep the bus waiting any longer. It isn't fair to the other people.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Hey, don't talk to me about fair.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 AGENT: I can get you on a plane back to Sydney on our dime. That's the best I can do.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: No. I don't want to go back to Sydney. Look I've been preparing for this for years. Just put me on the bus, right now, I can do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 AGENT: No, you can't.
Lost.Season01.Episode04 LOCKE: Hey, hey, don't you walk away from me. . You don't know who you're dealing with. Don't ever tell me what I can't do, ever. This is destiny. This is destiny. This is my destiny. (yelling) I'm supposed to do this, dammit. Don't tell me what I can't do. Don't tell me what I can't...
Lost.Season01.Episode04 CLAIRE:  Millicent Louise D'Agostino. Teaneck, New Jersey.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MEATHEAD: Stay down! It's your choice man, walk away now and you won't get your ass kicked.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MEATHEAD: You should've stayed down, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE:  Jack, Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE:  Jack. Hey, Jack. There's someone out there. You gotta—the current's—there's someone out there, look.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: I woke up and she's—I don't swim.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: I don't swim.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: You okay, just take deep breaths now. Come on, just breathe, just breathe.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: Did you get her?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: There was a woman—I was trying to—did you get her?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: You gotta go back.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: There's someone else still out there.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: So, what'd they say?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Jack, maybe you should...
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Who was she?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Her name was Joanna, she wasn't supposed to be on the plane. She was scuba diving off the barrier reef and got an ear infection so the doctor grounded her for two days. She bumped her flight. That's how she ended up with us.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: She was just swimming this morning, got caught in a riptide. We've been here six days and I never talked to her. Never said a word to her.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Jack, don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: There were 47 of us and I never said a single word to her.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: You tried.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: No I didn't. I thought maybe I'd—I thought maybe I could bring him back and still have the time. I was there, in the water. I didn't try. I decided not to go after her.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Are you okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Did you see that?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Standing there, in the water, there was a man. You didn't see that?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Jack, when was the last time you slept?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK:  I need to put this with the rest of the gear.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MICHAEL: Who taught you that?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 WALT: Sun, the Korean lady.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MICHAEL: Don't swallow it.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 WALT: Why not?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MICHAEL: Ocean water'll make you thirsty.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 WALT: Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MICHAEL:  Just don't swallow it, man. Alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JIN: 입술 좀 봐. 물을 꼭 마셔야 돼. 
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SUN: 아니. 난 괜찮아요… 고마워. 우리한테 언제 얘기해 줄까요? 뭘 어떻게 해야 할 지 모르겠네. 아무도 우릴 찾지 않을 것 같아요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JIN: 걱정하지 마. 사람이 올 거야. 
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SUN: 모두 다… 우릴 무시해요. 좀 더 적극적으로 얘기를 하려고 노력을 하면… 
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JIN : 우리는 괜찮을 거야. 다른 사람은 필요 없어. 그냥 내가 하라는 대로 하면 돼. 
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SHANNON: Have you got it or what?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: You're in my light, sticks.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SHANNON: Lightsticks? What the hell is that supposed to...?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: Light, comma, sticks. As in those legs of yours.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SHANNON: Look, while I really love my new nickname, and I think it's really sweet...
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: Calm down. I got your damn stuff.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SHANNON: It'll keep off sand fleas?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: You bet. Even has aloe.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SHANNON: How much?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: Your money's no good here.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SHANNON: Then what the hell do you want?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SHANNON: If you really think I'm going to...
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: Five grand.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SHANNON: I thought you said my money was no good here.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: I was negotiating. I can take an IOU. Something tells me you're good... for it.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: You haven't found a hairbrush in there, have you?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: No. Sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: I must have looked through twenty suitcases. I can't find one. It's weird, right? When you think that everyone packs a hairbrush.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: You alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: Yeah, it's just the heat. Oh, and, and I'm pregnant.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Really? 
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: Thanks. What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: I'm sorting the practical clothes from the impractical. Wanna help?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: Sure. Can I—can I ask you something?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Sure, shoot.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: Are you a Gemini?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Yeah, I am.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: I thought so, restless, passionate. You know, everyone thinks astrology's just a load of crap but that's just because they don't get it. I can do your chart if you want to?  Or not... Geminis...
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HURLEY: Hey Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HURLEY: Whoa. You look tired, brother.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: I'm fine. What's up?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HURLEY: We got a problem.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: That's it?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: That's it.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: How many?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: 18.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HURLEY: People just kind of took what they needed because we were supposed to be rescued, but we weren't.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: Even if we divided it up, split the bottles in half it wouldn't be enough for 47 people.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: 46. There is 46 of us now.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HURLEY: People find out this is all we have left, they're going to freak out, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: The boar's running low until we can catch another one. What should we tell them?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HURLEY: Maybe we can make one of those water finding sticks.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: What should we do with the stuff we've got?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: We should put it in the tent, yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HURLEY: Maybe the dog can find water?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: Probably better if no one knows how little is left.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HURLEY: I mean, dogs can find pot and bombs, so I'm sure they can find water.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: Don't tell the others we're running low. That way you can ration it. Then you can decide what...
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: I'm not deciding anything!
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HURLEY: Why not?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: You wanna come in?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: So, you want to tell me what happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 YOUNG JACK: A couple guys jumped Marc Silverman.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: A couple guys jumped Marc Silverman. But they didn't jump you?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 YOUNG JACK: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: I had a boy on my table today. I don't know, maybe a year younger than you. He had a bad heart. It got real hairy, real fast. And everybody's looking at your old man to make decisions. And I was able to make those decisions because at the end of the day, after the boy died, I was able to wash my hands and come home to dinner. You know, watch a little Carol Burnett, laugh till my sides hurt. And how can I do that, hmm? And even when I fail, how do I do that, Jack? Because I have what it takes. Don't choose, Jack, don't decide. You don't want to be a hero, you don't try and save everyone because when you fail... you just don't have what it takes.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE:  Why didn't you leave me? Hey, I'm talking to you.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Not now, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: I could have made it back. What? Not going to answer me? I told you to leave me.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: You were drowning.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: You should've saved her.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: But I didn't save her. And neither did you.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: You think you're all noble and heroic for coming after me? I was fine! You're not the only one who knows what to do around here, you know that? I run a business! Who appointed you our savior, huh? What gives you the right—. Look at me. Hey, I'm talking to you.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: Look at me, Jack. Where are you going? Hey, where are going? Hey!
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Dad?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MARGO: Your father's gone, Jack. Did you hear what I said? He's gone, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: He'll be back.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MARGO: This time it's different. I want you to bring him back.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MARGO: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: He hasn't talked to me in two months, Mom.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MARGO: You haven't talked to him in two months.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: He doesn't want me to bring him back, trust me. Let one of his friends.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MARGO: He doesn't have friends anymore. Why do you think that is? He was right about you.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Right about what?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MARGO: You don't understand the pressure that he's under.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: I understand pressure.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MARGO: Jack, please you know how he gets—he doesn't—he won't take care of himself. You have to go after him.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: I'm sorry. I can't.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MARGO: "I can't?" You don't get to say "I can't." Not after what you did. Bring your father home, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Where is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MARGO: Australia.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 WALT: Hey, hey!
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: What's the matter?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 WALT: That pregnant lady fell down.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: She just dropped.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: It must be the heat. Is she breathing?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MICHAEL: Yeah, I think.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Come on. Let's get her inside.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: Wake up.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Claire? Claire, honey, wake up. Claire? Can you hear me, Claire. Come on. Wake up. Come on. Come on, please wake up. Come on. Claire, can you hear me? Alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: Hmm?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Hi. It's me. It's Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: You passed out. Just take it easy, okay?  She needs water.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Don't move, okay? Honey, I think you have a fever, but if you keep really still that's okay. It's okay, it's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: What the... The water's gone. Someone stole it.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: Where is the doctor?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: I don't know. No one can find him.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAYID: Is this the last of the camp's water supply?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAYID: Keeping it all in one place, foolish.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: I can go into the jungle, try to find some fresh water.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAYID: You're not going alone.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: When the others find out the water's gone it's going to get ugly. And when they find out that someone pinched it, it's going to get uglier. I'll go. Camp needs you two here, especially with the doctor gone. And besides, I know where to look.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Where are you? Where are you?  Where are you?!
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HOTEL MANAGER: The maid says he hasn't used the bed in the past three days.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Did he rent a car from the concierge?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HOTEL MANAGER: No, sir. Quite honestly, Mr. Shephard, I don't think your father rented a car at all.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Yeah, why's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HOTEL MANAGER: There was an incident a few nights ago, here at the hotel bar. I had to get security to escort your father to his room.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: What's that have to do with renting a car?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HOTEL MANAGER: I'm sorry, sir, I shouldn't have said-
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Come on, what's that have to do with renting a car?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HOTEL MANAGER: Mr. Shephard, I don't think any rental agent in Sydney would lease your father a car in his condition.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: My father is a Chief of Surgery.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HOTEL MANAGER: Of course, sir. I apologize.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: He left his wallet. Who leaves a wallet?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HOTEL MANAGER: Perhaps you should talk to the police, Mr. Shephard.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Where are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: Take my hand. Come on.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: You okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: Hey. How long have I...
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: A couple of hours. Here. It's not much but it's what we have. Just relax, you have to think about the little one now, you.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: Thanks for the water, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: There'd be more if some git hadn't nicked it.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: Is Jack back yet?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: No. No one's seen him. But, I wouldn't worry. Good old Mr. Locke's gone into the jungle to get some water for you.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: Great. Our only hunter's going to get eaten just so he can get the pregnant girl some more water.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: I wouldn't worry, luv. I mean, you tell me, who would you rather meet in a dark alley, whatever's out there, or that geezer with his 400 knives? I mean, who packs 400 knives? Personally, I can only have space for 200, 300 at most.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE:  When are they going to rescue us?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: Soon.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: Thanks, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: For what?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: People don't seem to look me in the eye here. I think I scare them. The baby... It's like I'm this time bomb of responsibility just waiting to go off.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: You don't scare me.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 HURLEY: Uh, the Chinese people have water.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAYID: Where did you get this? Where did you get this?  Where! Did! You!-
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: She doesn't understand you.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAYID: She understands me. Did you steal this water?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SUN: 죄송하지만 무슨 오해가 있는 것 같은데요. 그런 게 아니라…
Lost.Season01.Episode05 Jin:  떨어져, 이 새끼야. 내 와이프 한 번만 더 만지면 넌 죽어.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Just take it easy, alright. We just want to talk, alright? This had water in it. Is it yours? Who gave you this?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAYID: I don't see the water.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: And?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAYID: You go after him now, he'll give you nothing. But if you wait, a rat will always lead you to it's hole.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: Well, it's about time.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: For what?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: I made this birthday wish four years ago.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Where's the water?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: That's better.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: Get off of me.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAYID: Give us the water now.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER:  Touch me again, huh.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: You really think I stole your damn water?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAYID: We know you gave two bottles to the Koreans.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: I don't give nothing to nobody.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: It's not here.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: I traded Mr. Miyagi the last of my water for a fish he caught. We worked it out caveman style.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: You gave him your last two bottles?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: Water has no value, Freckles. It's gonna rain sooner or later. And hell, I'm an optimist.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER:  Hey, you forgot something. . Seeing as you're the new sheriff in town. Might as well make it official.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: How are they, the others?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: Thirsty. Hungry. Waiting to be rescued. And they need someone to tell them what to do.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Me? I can't.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: Why can't you?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Because I'm not a leader.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: And yet they all treat you like one.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: I don't know how to help them. I'll fail. I don't have what it takes.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: Why are you out here, Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: I think I'm going crazy.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: No. You're not going crazy.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: No?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: No, crazy people don't know they're going crazy. They think they're getting sane. So, why are you out here?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: I'm chasing something—someone.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: Ah. The white rabbit. Alice in Wonderland.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Yeah, wonderland, because who I'm chasing—he's not there.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: But you see him?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Yes. But he's not there.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: And if I came to you and said the same thing, then what would your explanation be, as a doctor.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: I'd call it a hallucination. A result of dehydration, post traumatic stress, not getting more than two hours of sleep a night for the past week. All of the above.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: All right, then. You're hallucinating. But what if you're not?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: I'm an ordinary man, Jack, meat and potatoes, I live in the real world. I'm not a big believer in magic. But this place is different. It's special. The others don't want to talk about it because it scares them. But we all know it. We all feel it. Is your white rabbit a hallucination? Probably. But what if everything that happened here, happened for a reason? What if this person that you're chasing is really here?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: That's impossible.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: Even if it is, let's say it's not.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Then what happens when I catch him?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: I don't know. But I've looked into the eye of this Island. And what I saw was beautiful.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Wait, wait, wait, where are you going?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: To find some more water.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: I'll come with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: No. You need to finish what you started.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 LOCKE: Because a leader can't lead until he knows where he's going.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MEDICAL EXAMINER: The police found him in an alley in Queens Cross. Now, a tox screen showed a blood alcohol content, which for a man of his size, probably brought on myocardial infarction - a sizable, and fatal heart-attack.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK:  That's him.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: What do you mean you won't put it on the plane?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 AGENT: I'm sorry Mr. Shephard, but our policy is that the body must have the proper documentation. There's just no latitude.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: No latitude? No latitude?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 AGENT: Without the proper documents-
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Look, you can't do this to me. I'm ready to go now.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 AGENT: Perhaps another carrier?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: No!
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: I want you to listen to me, okay. Because I'm asking you a favor, Chrissy. I'm standing in front of you in the same suit that I'm wearing to my father's funeral and I'm asking you a favor. In 16 hours I need to land at LAX, and I need that coffin to clear customs because there's going to be a hearse waiting there. And I need that hearse to take me and that coffin to a cemetery. Why? Chrissy, why can't I just bring him to a funeral home and make all the arrangements? Why can't I really take my time with it? Because... because I need it to be done. I need it to be over. I just—I need to bury my father.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: Hey, hey, Claire .
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CLAIRE: How did you get that?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: Shhh.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE:  Where'd you get that?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: Here's your thief.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 MICHAEL: Where'd he hide it?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: I don't know. This wanker had three bottles on him. Why'd you do it, pretty boy, eh?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: It was just sitting in—it was just sitting in the tent, and Jack just took off.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE: Claire could've died!
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: I tried to give her some sooner, but it just got out of hand. No one would have understood.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE:  What is going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: Someone had to take responsibility for it. It would have never lasted!
Lost.Season01.Episode05 CHARLIE:  Oh shut up!
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK:  Leave him alone! It's been six days and we're all still waiting. Waiting for someone to come. But what if they don't? We have to stop waiting. We need to start figuring things out. A woman died this morning just going for a swim and he tried to save her, and now you're about to crucify him? We can't do this. Every man for himself is not going to work. It's time to start organizing. We need to figure out how we're going to survive here. Now, I found water. Fresh water, up in the valley. I'll take a group in at first light. If you don't wanna come then find another way to contribute. Last week most of us were strangers, but we're all here now. And god knows how long we're going to be here. But if we can't live together, we're going to die alone.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SUN: 고마워요-- 아까 물 갖다 줘서. 
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JIN: 남편이니까 그렇게 해야지. 
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: So, how does it feel?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 BOONE: How does what feel?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 SAWYER: Taking my place at the top of everyone's most hated list. Sucks, don't it?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: So where were you today Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Just had to take care of a few things.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: That's all I'm gonna get, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: My father died. In Sydney.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 KATE: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode05 JACK: Yeah. I'm sorry, too.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: It's not like I'm asking a personal question.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: It is a personal question.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: You don't have to get all quiet on me. I just want to know.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Well, you're not going to know.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: What's the big deal?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: It's not a big deal. It's just something I did. I had my reasons. And I don't want to put it out there.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: It's just that you and your tattoos don't add up. Are you one of those hard-core spinal surgeons?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: That's me. Hard-core.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: If you guys are finished verbally copulating we should get a move on. There's a whole beach of people waiting for us to get some drinking water for them. And the great white hunter's getting restless.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Okay, let's do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: Hey, Charlie. Ask Jack about his tattoos.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: Oh, you guys have an inside joke. How absolutely wonderful for you both.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: Miss. 샴페인 드실래요? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: Miss. 뭘 두고 가셨네요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 그래요? 뭐죠?  우리 아빠는? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 손님 때문에 바빠. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 빨리 이 곳을 떠나고 싶어. 응? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 어디로? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 미국. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 날 좀 봐. 자기야, 사랑해. 널 데리고 도망 가고 싶지는 않아. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 우리한테는 오직 이 방법 밖에 없어. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 너희 아버지가 절대 허락 안 할거야. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 아빠가 허락할 문제가 아니야. 우리가 결정할 문제지. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 내가 아버지한테 말씀 드릴게. 그리고 설득해 볼게. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 자기야. 우리 아빠를 몰라서 하는 얘기야. 지금. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 날 믿어봐. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 너무 예쁘다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 이게 다이아몬드였다면 좋았을 텐데. 언젠가는 그렇게 될 거야. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 여보, 왜 그래요? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Hey, hey, what the...
Lost.Season01.Episode06 WALT: Stop! Hey stop!
Lost.Season01.Episode06 Sun: 여보, 그만 해. 그만 해! 뭐하는 거야? 여보! 여보! 여보!
Lost.Season01.Episode06 WALT: Get off of him, please! Stop! Stop!
Lost.Season01.Episode06 WALT:  Do something! He's going to kill him! Stop him, please!
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: The handcuffs from the Sky Marshal! Now!
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID:  What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Water's this way.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: How'd you find this place?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Luck.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: This is it.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: It's amazing.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: Absolutely.  It's totally you.  Hey guys, shouldn't someone look through this stuff? Could be something useful in here.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: He's got a point.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: I do?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Yeah. Bring me your bottles, and keep an eye out for any medical supplies, drugs in particular.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE:  Drugs, right.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE:  Don't move.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE:  Look, I was just going to take...
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Do not move.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE:  He's standing on a beehive.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: What's a beehive doing there? Beehives are supposed to be in trees.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: What now?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: If he moves, he'll split the hive.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: I don't like bees, okay. I have an irrational fear of bees. I think I'm allergic to bees.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Please be quiet.  We need to get something to seal the hive.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: To cover it?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Hurry.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: I'm getting tired of saying this. I was just walking the beach with my son, and all of the sudden this dude is all up on me. I didn't do anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 Jin: 시끄러워!
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: Surely there must be something you're not telling us.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Surely? Where you from man?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: Tikrit. Iraq.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Okay. I don't know how it is in Iraq, but in the United States of America where I'm from, Korean people don't like black people. Did you know that?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 거짓말 하지 마!
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: So maybe you ought to talk to him !
Lost.Season01.Episode06 Sun:   지금 시계 때문에 그래요, 시계.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: The cuffs stay on!
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAWYER: A little louder, Omar. Maybe then she'll understand you.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 HURLEY:  Guys, that Chinese dude is going to get pretty crispy out here. How long are you going to keep him tied down like that?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: He tried to kill Michael. We all saw it. The cuffs stay on until we know why.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL:  Come on, man. Let's go.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 [Everyone disperses, Sawyer stays looking over at Jin and Sun off camera.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 어떻게 됐어? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN:  그게 말이야, 너희 아버님이—허락하셨어. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN : 다시는 그런 장난 치지 마! 어떻게 된 거야? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 내가 아버님을 설득했지. 일 년 경영 수업을 받고, 일 년 공장에서 일 하면, 우리가 원하는 돈이 생길거야. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 아빠 밑에서 일 할거야? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 그렇게 하는 게 옳은 거야. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 하지만 자기야, 그거는...
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 아니, 그렇게 해야… 잠깐 뿐이야. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 어머, 자기야… 이렇게 비싼 걸 어떻게 샀어? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 이제 이 정도는 할 수 있어. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Okay. Just keep still man. I'm going to try to cover the hive.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: This is the most crap idea ever. It's never going to work.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Now, pull yourself together, son.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: It wouldn't be an irrational fear of bees if I could just pull myself together, would it?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: Who is he. How'd he get here?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: I can't exactly perform an autopsy but there doesn't seem to be any major trauma to the bones. There's another one over here. Someone laid them to rest here.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: Who?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: Where would they come from?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Didn't you guys shoot a polar bear last week?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Where'd that come from?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: Any idea how long they've been here?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Long. It takes 40 or 50 years for clothing to degrade like this.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: What is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE:  Hello? Anybody there? Everyone alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK:  A few stings aside.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: You two run away fantastically. Glad my diversion spared you. I was only stung several hundred times. Oh, and uh, someone left this .
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: It was, um, it was full of bees.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: I'd have thought C's, actually.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: Sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: Bloody Hell! Are these the people who were here before us?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: Uh, just, you know, the, the, there could have been people here before us, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Clearly. But, who were these men?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Actually, one of them is female.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Our very own Adam and Eve.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 뭐 하는 거야? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 상처가 너무 심해서. .]
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN:  조심해. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 어때? 좋아? 내가 사무실 가서 보내는 시간이 많으니까, 개라도 키우면 어떨까 해서. 물론, 니가 밥도 주고, 훈련도 시켜야 되는데.  괜찮겠지? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 당신의 꽃 한 송이가 내 인생의 전부였을 때? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 아버지네. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: I think one of us should stay and help Charlie salvage the wreckage.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: You offering?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Sure. Give me a chance to get to know him a little better.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: We should move out. People are probably getting thirsty.  What?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: 46 people need to drink a half gallon a day each. Carrying all this water back and forth is going to be real pain in the ass.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: You're starting to make me regret volunteering.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: These caves make too good a shelter just to be used for burial. Adam and Eve, they must have lived here. Their plane crashed, or maybe they were ship-wrecked. They probably found this place and knew they could survive here. Unlimited supply of fresh water, tree canopy keeps the temperature down, shields out the sun, , the openings are narrow, easier for protection against predators. We don't need to bring the water to the people. We need to bring the people to the water. . I think we could live here.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL:  Hey, what are you doing?  You say something to my boy?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Yeah, nice talking to you, too. Move it, Walt.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 WALT: How come he doesn't like us?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 WALT: You said people like him don't like people like us.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Oh man. You know, uh, look, that's not true, and you know what, I don't think like that anyway. I was, I was angry.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 WALT: What did you do to him?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: What did I do to him? You tell me? I've been with you since we crashed. Have you seen me do anything, to anyone? What kind of man do you think I am, anyway? What did your mother say about me?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 WALT: She never talked about you.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: You don't know anything about me, do you?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 WALT: You don't know anything about me.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: I know a lot about you.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 WALT: Yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 WALT: When's my birthday?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: August 24th. When's mine?  Forget it, come on, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 여보, 제발. 내가 가서 설명을 하게 해 줘. 내가 얘기를 잘 하면 당신을 풀어 줄 수도 있잖아. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 니가 어떻게 설명해? 그냥 여기 있어. 도둑놈한테 일일이 얘기할 필요 없어. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 여보, 왜 그래? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 도대체 말 좀 해 봐. 여보, 다쳤어? 무슨 일이야? 무슨 일 했어? 이 피는 누구 피야? 밖에서 무슨 일 있었구나. 밖에서 무슨 일이 있었냐구?  What happened to you? What were you doing? Whose blood is this? What were you doing? What happened?]
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 일 하고 왔어. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 일 하고 왔다구? 도대체 아빠 밑에서 무슨 일을 하는 거야? 날 좀 봐. 얘기 좀 해 봐. 날 좀 바라봐.  
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 아버님이 시키는 대로 할 뿐이야. 다 우리를 위해서 하는 거야. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: You checking me out?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: No harm in it.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Trust me, if I was checking you out, you'd know it.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: Yeah, so then what were you thinking? Right now.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Well, I sure as hell wasn't thinking that.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: Don't stop to think, just tell me.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: I was thinking that if we were living at the caves we could build a dam around that spring so that everybody could have fresh water and we could get the infirmary off the beach. You think it's a bad idea?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: No, no. It makes sense.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: But?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: No but.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Good, because a lot of people are still hoping a rescue boat is going to show up. They're not thinking about their own safety. We're going to have a lot of convincing to do.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: We? You still haven't convinced me yet.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: You following me?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: There's no need. I'm just going to the loo.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Is there something you want to tell me, Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: I'm going to the loo.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: It's dangerous out there. Until we get back to the beach, I'm not breaking line of sight with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: Bugger off.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: I know who you are. And I know what you're looking for. Drive Shaft -- you played bass.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: And guitar -- on a couple of tracks. You really heard of us?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Hey, just because I'm over 40 doesn't mean I'm deaf. I have both your albums. Although, I thought that your self-titled debut was a much stronger effort than Oil Change. It's a shame what happened to the band. How long since you played?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: My guitar? Uh, 8 days, 11 hours, give or take.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: You miss it?  Well, a lot of wreckage. It might still turn up.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: Undamaged? Still playable? I don't think so. I mean, I wish, but there was this bloke at the counter made me check it in.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: Yeah. There wasn't enough room in the cabin, fascist.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: You'll see it again.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: Oh yeah? What makes you say that?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Because I have faith, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: It's about time. I am dying of thirst.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: I think I'll let him sit in the sun a while longer. Then I'll take his wife aside, find some way to communicate. I think she knows why he attacked Michael.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: You're sure you don't want me to talk to her?  Okay. If you've got that under control I'm going to start talking to people about the caves. Might be able to get a few to go with me before nightfall, start setting up camp.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: You're serious? Is there a reason you didn't consult us when you decided to form your own civilization?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: I'm only talking about moving into the valley.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: Well, what happened to live together, die alone?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Digging in together is the only way we're going to survive.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: Our best hope of survival is in being spotted by a plane or a ship, and for that we need to organize everyone to keep that signal fire burning while others scout the Island for supplies. Digging in anywhere else is suicide!
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: It is the only source of fresh water we've found, Sayid.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: And staying on the beach, in the sun without water? That's not suicide?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID:  I'm not going to admit defeat.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Now what? I already gave you my statement, sheriff.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: I came to apologize. I shouldn't have been suspicious. You were the victim in the attack this morning.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: I appreciate that, but I can tell you didn't come all the way over here just to say you're sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: People are seriously considering following Jack to the caves. I'd like to know where you stand.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Right here. I've got one priority right now and that's to get my kid off this Island. A boat passes, I'm not going to be on the hook for missing it.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAYID: Good.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Slowly, just a little bit at a time, little bit.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK:  Glad you're coming.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 HURLEY: Hey man, I go where the boar's at. So, what's up with you and Kate? You guys going to move into a cave together, or what?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Sorry, am I in high school?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 HURLEY: Well, that wasn't a denial.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Just get your stuff together, we've got to get out of here soon.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAWYER:  Well, well, well, if ain't the belle of the ball? So what's it like having both the doctor and Captain Falafel fighting over you?  Just call 'em how I seem 'em, Freckles. Truth be told, I'm not the only one wondering where you're going to weigh in on this whole moving off the beach thing. Are you going with the pessimists, or staying here and waiting for the rescue boats?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: Are you going?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAWYER: Well, that's the real trick, isn't it? We all pack up stakes for the caves and the next day a plane passes by, they're going to go on their merry way and be none the wiser. On the other hand, stay here, get eaten by boars, fall off a rock, not going to be anyone around to answer that 911 call.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: Still haven't answered my question.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SAWYER: You didn't answer mine. And I asked first.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 INTERIOR DECORATOR: 당신 남편이 이 곳을 새로 인테리어 하는 데 돈에 대해서는 신경 쓰지 말라 그러시더군요. 당신은 정말 럭키 와이프에요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 네. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 여보, 개 좀 치워라. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 그럼 우리 먼저 침실로 들어가서 볼까요, 한 번? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 INTERIOR DECORATOR: 당신 확실해요? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 네. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 INTERIOR DECORATOR: 레슨 받았어요? 공부는 했구요? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 네. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 INTERIOR DECORATOR: 당신 알죠? 당신 남편이나 당신 아버지가 당신을 찾기 위해서 무슨 일이든 할 수 있다는 거. 당신… 남편이랑 다시 화해하는 건 어때요? 대답해 봐요. 예? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 제가 떠난 후에 우리 강아지 좀 부탁할게요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 INTERIOR DECORATOR, : 당신들이 여행하는 동안, 공항에서, 시간은 열 한 시 십오 분. 당신은 무슨 수를 써서라도 공항 밖으로 빠져나와야 해요. 나올 땐 아무 것도 가지고 나와선 안 돼요. 당신이 납치 됐다고 생각할 거에요. 첫 일주일 동안은 당신 가족들이 당신이 죽었다고 생각할 때 까지 당신은 조용히, 가만히 있어야 돼요. 그 후엔 당신이 원하는 대로 자유롭게 움직일 수가 있죠. 말해봐요. 언제라 그랬죠? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 공항에서, 열 한 시 십오 분에. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 INTERIOR DECORATOR: 다시 한 번. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 열 한 시 십오 분. 열 한 시 십오 분. 열 한 시 십오 분.  
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Oh great, look who came to chat.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: I need to talk to you.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: You speak English?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: What? You speak English? Why didn't you say anything?!
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: My husband doesn't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Why would you learn English and not tell your husband?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: He has a bad temper. What my husband did to you today, it was a misunderstanding.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: No. I got it. Loud and clear.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: It was the watch.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Your husband tried to murder me for a watch?!  I found this watch two days ago.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: It belongs to my father. Protecting that watch is a question of honor.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: He calls trying to kill me in front of my kid, honor?!
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: You don't know my father. I need your help.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: Listen to me, you old git, I'm going in the jungle. A man has a right to some privacy.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Just hand it to me. You're going to run out. My guess is sooner rather than later. Painful detox is inevitable. Give it up now at least it will be your choice.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: Don't talk to me like you know something about me.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: I know a lot more about pain than you think. I don't envy what you're facing. But I want to help. . Do you want your guitar?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: More than your drug?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: More than you know.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: What I know is that this Island might just give you what you're looking for, but you have to give the Island something.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE:  You really think you can find my guitar?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: Look up, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 CHARLIE: You're not going to ask me to pray or something.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: I want you to look up.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Hey. It's almost time to go.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: I don't want to be Eve.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: No one's asking you to.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: I just can't -- dig in.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Why not? Someone else can stay here, keep a look out, wait for rescue. Why does it have to be you?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: That's not it.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Then what is it? Kate, how did you get to be this way? Just what is it that you did?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE: You had your chance to know.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: If you need me you know where to find me. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 KATE:  You know where to find me, too.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: I know you can't understand a word, and normally I'm not the talking out loud type, but since I have a captive audience, I hope for your sake you pay attention. I'm not exactly having the best month of my life. I barely knew my son, and now, I gotta be his daddy. And then to top if off, I have a deranged Korean guy trying to kill me and for what?! Look, I get it, right . It's the watch. Mine broke and I found this in the wreckage, and I figured, "hey, why let a $20,000 dollar watch go to waste"? Which is ridiculous since time doesn't matter on a damn Island!
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Stay away from me. And my kid.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JIN: 왜 그래? 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 SUN: 너무 예뻐서. 
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: Hello?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 LOCKE: What's this?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 JACK: New tenants.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 HURLEY: Short walk. They lied.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 WALT: Can I ask you something?
Lost.Season01.Episode06 MICHAEL: Anything you want, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode06 WALT: When's your birthday?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: Charlie. Charlie. How about you and I go for a walk?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: No. No thanks, Locke. I think I'm going to stay in today.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: Come on. Fresh air will do you good.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE:  I take better pictures than that. Smaller, too, if you want something for your wallet.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: I just came by for a few things and this was. . . this was with my stuff. .
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: So you're not staying?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Call me a broken record, but caves are a natural shelter. And a hell of a safer than living here on the beach.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: You're mad at me.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: No. Kate, I'm -- I just don't understand why you won't come with me. Us. It's maybe a mile up there, if that.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: We crashed 8 days ago, Jack. I'm not setting up a house here.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: I want off this Island too, but we both know that's not gonna happen any time soon.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Sayid has a plan.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Yeah, to find the source of the distress code, I know.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: The signal's coming from somewhere on the Island. If we can find it. . .
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: The signal has been running on a loop for 16 years, Kate. And the woman that left it, she wasn't rescued. What makes you think it's gonna be any different for us?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: I believe it.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Well, I wish I shared your faith.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER:  Wouldn't mind sharing a few things with her myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: What do you want, Sawyer?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: Heard the doctor was vacating the premises. Thought I'd best lay claims to my new digs before somebody else did . I could fix this place up real good. Might even find somebody to share it with me .
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK:  I'll talk to you later.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Locke, is that you?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  Bless me father, for I have sinned.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  It's been a week since my last confession.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 PRIEST: Go ahead my son.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Last night I had physical relations with a girl I didn't even know.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 PRIEST: I see. Anything else?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Yeah. Uh, right after that I had relations with another girl. Then straight after that I watched while they had relations with each other. You see, it's, it's my band, father, Drive Shaft. We've been playing the clubs in Manchester. And, uh, we've been getting some heat, a following, you know, and, uh, the girls. There's some real temptations that come with the territory, if you know what I mean.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 PRIEST: Well, we all have our temptations, but giving in to them, that's your choice. As we live our lives it's really nothing but a series of choices, isn't it?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Well, then, I've made my choice. I have to quit the band.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: And the meek shall inherit the earth.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Liam, what are doing? This is a church.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Relax, choir boy. I bring good tidings of great joy. We've just been signed. A recording contract. You're gonna be a rock god.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: Nice work, Charlie. You make excellent bait.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  I'm glad I could oblige. Now give me my bloody drugs.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Did you hear what I said? I want my drugs back. I need 'em.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: Yet you gave them to me. Hmm.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: And I bloody well regret it. I'm sick, man. Can't you see that?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: I think you're a lot stronger than you know, Charlie. And I'm going to prove it to you. I'll let you ask me for your drugs three times. The third time, I'm going to give them to you. Now, just so we're clear, this is one.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Why? Why? Why are you doing this? To torture me? Just get rid of them and have done with it?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: If I did that you wouldn't have a choice, Charlie. And having choices, making decisions based on more than instinct, is the only thing that separates you from him .
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID: Three antenna. Three points of a triangle. One here on the beach. Another, Kate will position in the jungle, roughly two kilometers in, and the third I'll take to high ground, up there. If the French transmission is coming from somewhere within our triangulation, I'll be able to locate the source. But there are two complications.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 BOONE: Of course there are.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID: The power cells I grafted onto the antennas are dry. There's no telling how long they'll last. A minute -- maybe more, maybe less.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: So we have to wait until we're in position before we switch them on.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 BOONE: Wait. Wait a second. How are we going to be able to tell that we're actually in the right position? We have no way to communicate with each other.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Bottle rockets?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID: Thank God for fireworks smugglers. Now, when I'm in position I'll fire off my rocket. When you two see it, you fire yours. As soon as the last one has gone up we all switch on our antennas.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Okay, but you said there are two complications.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID: The battery in the transceiver is dead. Without the transceiver all of this is for nothing. Something from a laptop computer would probably work, but I've not been able to find anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: I think I might know where to look.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: You're hoarding like a pack rat since the crash and you don't have a single laptop?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: We are testy. Still upset about your little break up? You and Jacko?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: It must be exhausting.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: What's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Living like a parasite -- always taking, never giving.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: Well, you got me pegged, don't you?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: I get it now. You don't want off this Island because there's nothing for you to go back for. Nobody you miss. And no one misses you.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: Oh, you're feeling sorry for me.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: I don't feel sorry for you. I pity you.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: All you had to do was say please.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Dude, what's in these things, cinderblocks?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: I packed everything I thought might be useful here without leaving the others shorthanded.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Hey, you guys need a hand? . I used to load the band's equipment, before we had roadies, way back in the day. Here let me.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Charlie, the zipper's...
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: ...broken.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Sorry, just trying to help.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: I know, I know, it's okay.  Hey, want to help me grab the rest of those bags?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Oh, could I?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Oh, uh, I have a headache.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK:  Diazepam. That's for anxiety.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: I was looking for aspirin.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Pretty strong stuff for a headache.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Yeah, right.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Hey, you okay? You're looking a little...
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: No, it's nothing, it's just a headache.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Charlie, leave it. Go get some water. Maybe you're dehydrated. Charlie, I got it. Go take care of yourself, man. We don't need you right now.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Come on, Charlie boy. We can't do this without you. You are bloody Drive Shaft.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Watch the language.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM:  This is our shot at the big time. What? You don't want to be famous?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: It's not about all that. I only care about the music.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Yeah, your music. Your songs that got us signed. I'm just a clown with a pretty face that sings them. And you want to take away my chance to be somebody?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Liam, it's not about you. It's -- I love the band. It's not who I am. Sometimes I just get lost in it.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Won't happen -- because I'll be there looking out for you. We'll look out for each other. That's what brothers do, right? Right?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Wait, wait, wait wait wait. Just promise me one thing. If things get too crazy no matter what, if I say we're done, we walk away.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: We walk away.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Liam, promise.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: We walk away. You're the rock god baby brother.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SUN: 손목을 의사에게 좀 보여줘야겠어요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JIN: 괜찮아. 나아지겠지. 옷이 그게 뭐야? 너무 야하잖아. 긴 거로 입어. 
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SUN:  긴 건 너무 더워요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Hey, dude. This yours?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Oh yeah. You're probably wondering because I play bass in Drive Shaft. I wrote a bunch of tunes on that -- You, All, Everybody.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Listen, uh, man. Jack just wants you to find another place for it. He's moving supplies and says it's in the way.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  You know? A lot of people look up to me. They respect me. And you, you just treat me like I'm some bloody child! Like I'm some useless joke!
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Charlie's not good enough to do this, Charlie's just in the way. Put Charlie onto that.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Sit down. Let me take a look at you man.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Oh, you're going to look out for me, yeah?! We'll look out for each other, that's how it is?! I'm not interested!
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Charlie, just calm down, alright. You're not yourself.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: You don't know me! I'm a bloody rock god!
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Oh, no.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Charlie, where's Jack? Where's Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Jack, Jack can you hear me?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: I don't know what happened. We were just talking and it -- and it came down on us -- all happened so fast.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Dude, we gotta get help. Charlie, go down to the beach and get help.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Okay, I'm on it.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: And make sure you tell Kate!
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: What we're doing -- chasing some phantom distress signal -- what are the odds of this working?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID: No worse than the odds of our surviving that plane crash.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: People survive plane crashes all the time.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID: Not like this one. The tail section broke off while we were still in the air. Our section cart wheeled through the jungle and yet we escaped with nothing but a few scrapes. How do you explain that?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Blind, dumb luck?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID: No one's that lucky. We shouldn't have survived.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Sorry, Sayid, some things just happen, no rhyme, no reason.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Hey, hey, we need help.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: What's wrong, man?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: It's Jack, he's trapped.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 BOONE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: A cave collapsed. We don't even know if he's alive. Come on, we've gotta go.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Hey, uh, uh, Scott?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 STEVE: I'm Steve.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SCOTT: I'm Scott.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: We've got an emergency, grab a couple of guys and let's go.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: We've got to go now.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 BOONE: Shannon, you have to be ready to do something really important, okay? At 5 o'clock sharp you have to be ready to turn that antenna on over there. There's a switch at the base.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SHANNON: Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 BOONE: Because Kate and Sayid are triangulating the French signal. But the antenna's power's really weak so you have to wait until they fire their bottle rockets. Then you fire this one. Then you turn on the antenna. Got it?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SHANNON: The switch is where now?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 BOONE: Did you hear a word I said? Can you or can't you do it?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SHANNON: Yeah, I can.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 BOONE: Okay,  okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  Wait. Kate. Hey, we have to tell Kate about Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: Sorry sport, you just missed her. Her and Mohammad headed into the woods about 10 minutes ago.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Which way?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: Don't sweat it, amigo. I know which way they went.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Yeah, but-
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: I'll tell her. You just keep doing... whatever it is you do around here.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: What the hell was that?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: That was another kick ass show. You were bloody brilliant.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: I sing the chorus to You All Everybody.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Oh yeah, sorry about that. . Got caught up in the moment. The crowd wanted it, you know.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Yeah, I know. If I start and then you come in after me...
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM:  She's cool. Let her in. (to Charlie) I won't let it happen again. I promise. (Liam gets the groupie, pulls out some drugs and Charlie sees). Chill, baby brother.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Wait. Hey wait.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Jack's in there.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Let me check it out before you start moving things around. If it's unstable...
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Well, how do you know-
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: 8 years of construction work. Hey Walt, get back, man, I don't want you near the rocks, okay, and take the dog with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 WALT: You guys need Mr. Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Locke's out in the jungle killing stuff. Who knows where he is.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Alright, this area here is load-bearing. We've got to dig where there's no danger of the wall buckling in on itself. Here, we dig in here so the wall doesn't collapse. Four at a time, by hand, until we can find some kind of shovel. We take shifts, and go slow. Whoever isn't digging should be clearing the rocks that we clear out and bring the water to whoever is working, okay. Let's move.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: What the hell are you doing here?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: Easy. Just came to tell you something.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: What makes you think I'm interested in anything you have to say?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER:  Just came to tell you, you were right about me that I don't help anyone but myself. Well, here I am, ready to pitch in.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: You're here to help?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: Hey, you act anymore surprised and I'm going to get offended.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: Something wrong, Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Yeah, Jack. He's a -- there's been an accident at the caves. Jack's trapped in a cave-in.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: Is anyone trying to get him out?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Yeah, there's a bunch of people there now.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: Then why aren't you with them? You didn't come here to tell me about Jack, did you?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  I want my stash, Locke. I can't stand feeling like this.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: Come here. Let me show you something. . What do you suppose is in that cocoon, Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: I don't know, a butterfly, I guess?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: No, it's much more beautiful than that. That's a moth cocoon. It's ironic, butterflies get all the attention; but moths -- they spin silk, they're stronger, they're faster.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: That's wonderful, but...
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: You see this little hole? This moth's just about to emerge. It's in there right now, struggling. It's digging its way through the thick hide of the cocoon. Now, I could help it, take my knife, gently widen the opening, and the moth would be free. But it would be too weak to survive. The struggle is nature's way of strengthening it. Now this is the second time you've asked me for your drugs back . Ask me again and it's yours.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Hey, we're through, we got a hole.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Jack? Jack? Can you hear me, Jack? Come on dude, answer me.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: I hear him.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 BOONE:  He's alive.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Jack, bro, you okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: I'm pinned. I can't move. I can't move.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY:  What do we do? How do we get him out?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Charlie was with me.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: He's okay. He made it out.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Hey listen, Jack, we're going to get you out of there, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID: We'll place the second antenna here.  You want to help?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID: Attach this antenna up in that tree, as high up as you can.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: Golly, thanks, boss. .
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID:  Five o'clock. Watch for my flare, then it's your turn. I don't trust him.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Who does?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID: I don't trust him with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: I can handle him.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Okay, we can't safely make that tunnel any bigger, but since Jack can't get out, one of us is going to have to go in and un-pin him.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: What, crawl through that?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 BOONE: I think we need someone smaller.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JIN: 내 와이프가 당신들 때문에 위험에 빠지는 걸 볼 순 없어.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Dude, we don't understand Chinese.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Korean, man. They're Korean.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  I'll do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: No, man. Look, you're still too shook up. I might be able to squeeze through...
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Hey, who's going to take care of your son if something happens.  She's got a husband,  he's got a sister. I'm alone here, no one on the Island. Let me do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: Still ain't five, just like the last time you checked your watch.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: I just don't want to miss Sayid's signal. Remember, I'll fire the flare, you set off the antenna.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: I just thank the good lord I've got you here to keep reminding me.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: So what is it about that guy -- Jack.  What it is about him makes you all weak in the loins.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Do you try to be a pig, or does it just come naturally?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: So, he's a doctor, right? Yeah, the ladies dig the doctors. Hell, give me a couple of band aids, a bottle of peroxide, I could run this Island too.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: You're actually comparing yourself to Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER:  The difference between us ain't that big, sweetheart. I guarantee you, if he had survived a few more weeks on this Island you'd have figured that out.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: What did you just say?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: Ah, damn. Didn't I tell you? Word from the valley is Saint Jack got himself buried in a cave-in.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAWYER: Look at the bright side, now you have someone else to pity.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Listen, man, go slow. Try not to nudge any of the rocks around you.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Anything else?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Yeah, good luck.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 BOONE:  Be safe man.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Good luck, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Alright, thanks guys.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM:  Everybody wants more, everybody wants to have a piece. All these people, they can't leave you alone when you're...
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Bloody hell.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Hey, baby brother, grab a bird and sit down.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  Get out.  You too, get out.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Oh, I spilled on myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  Out!
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Out?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  Come on, now!
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Come back in five minutes.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Sound check, you missed sound check, you don't show up for rehearsal. We've got a show in an hour.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM:  Oooh, show. I like shows.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Alright, that's it. After tonight, we cancel the rest of the tour.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: We walk away.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Are you off your head?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: We're walking away like we said we would if things got...
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Walk away and go where?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Liam, you're killing yourself with this junk, you're destroying Drive Shaft!
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM:  I am Drive Shaft! Nobody even knows who the sodding bass player is! This is it, Charlie -- end of the rainbow. You really think you can walk away? Then what, eh? Face it, if you're not in this band, what the bloody hell use are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Liam?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Piss off!
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Charlie? Charlie move! Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Hi. I'm... I'm here to rescue you.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: I say we try again.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 BOONE: We can't just leave them.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: If we don't move, they're going to run out of air.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Would you stop talking, I'm trying to think.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Where is he? Where is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Where is he? Where's Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY:  He's in there.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Does anyone know if he's alive? Is he alive?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: We don't know. Charlie went in there through a tunnel that we dug, but it collapsed.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Why is nobody digging? 
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Okay, one, two, three. . Sorry, Jack. Sorry. You alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: My shoulder's dislocated.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  What?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: You're going to have to pop it back in.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: No, I can't.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: I need your help on this, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: I can't do it, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Yes you can. Yes you can.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Okay, what do I -- what do I do?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Take my hand...
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: This hand? Okay, okay, wait, okay, okay .
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Now, when I tell you to, pull as hard as you possibly can.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Jack, I don't know, I don't, I don't...
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: You can do this, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Now.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM:  Charlie? What are you doing here?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: A bloke can't pay his big brother a visit once in a while?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Of course you can. Why didn't you call, you lunatic. . What are you doing in Sydney?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: It's all lined up, Liam. 8 weeks on tour opening for some band called Meat Coat. First gig's in Los Angeles. LA, Liam. This is a chance to get back on a label, a real one.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: This is our comeback.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Charlie, I don't want to come back.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Yeah, right. Well, here's the thing. They won't book Drive Shaft without you. So I'm asking as a brother, the way you asked me.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: You were with me the night I missed Megan's birth. You were the one I was stumbling around Dresden with trying to find a sodding fix. Oh man, you're still using, aren't you?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Don't change the subject.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: That's why you haven't been returning my calls.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Look, are you going to go on tour with us or not?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: You said you were going to get some help, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: I lost your sodding number, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: You're still a junkie.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: You did this to me! It was about the music! The music, Liam. You took that away from me.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Listen, why don't you stay with us for a few weeks. Karen and me, we can get you help. Sydney's got some really good programs.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Forget it. 
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Don't go.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Thanks for your help, brother.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LIAM: Stay, please. I'm just looking out for you!
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  You never looked out for me! I have a plane to catch.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: How long has it been, Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: I don't know what you're going on about.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: How long since your last fix?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Almost a day and a half.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: How's the withdrawal treating you? Any hallucinations?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Apart from the conversation I had with you about an hour ago in the jungle, no, not really.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Why didn't you say anything? I could've helped you through this.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Yeah, you think I'm useless, and a junkie to boot.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Useless? You're not useless. That took a lot of guts getting in here and trying to rescue me. I won't forget that.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE:  For the rest of our lives?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: At the rate we're using our oxygen in here, that won't be too long.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: This place, it reminds me of confession, those little claustrophobic booths.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: I wouldn't have taken you for a religious man.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: I used to be. Hey, you want to hear my confession? Might take a while.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Hey, I'm no saint, either.  What's wrong?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: It's a moth.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: A what?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Right behind you, look. There's a bloody moth in here. Look. 
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Charlie, what are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: Hey Kate, you need to take a break.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: I'm fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 MICHAEL: We've got enough people to dig. You keep going at this pace your going to kill yourself.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: There's light.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: I can see light.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 WALT: Hey, it's the doctor.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Ow, easy, my shoulder, careful.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: How'd you get out?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Charlie, Charlie found a way out.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Dude, you rock.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID:  Alright everyone, now it's your turn.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SHANNON: We're in Malibu part of the year, but the guys there are such idiots.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 .
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SHANNON:  Dammit! Dammit, dammit, dammit. .
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID:  Come on, come on, one more. Come on Kate. Come on.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 SAYID: Yes. Yes.  Where are you?  Yes!!!  Where are you? Where are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY:  Dude, you feeling okay? You look a little...
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Flu. He's got the flu.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 HURLEY: Oh man, that's rough after all you've been through. Take it easy, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: I think I'm going to stretch my legs.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 WALT: This place is cool. Can we live here?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Made you something.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Awww. My very first sling.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: How's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Good. Thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: So these are the safe caves you've been going on about.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: This was a fluke. Michael checked out the integrity of the rest of the caves and gave them an okay. So you're heading back to the beach, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: Sayid should be back there by now and if his plan worked then...
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Then we're one step closer to getting off this Island.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 JACK: Thanks for the sling, Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 KATE: You're welcome.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: Give them to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: This is the third time. Are you sure you really want them?
Lost.Season01.Episode07 CHARLIE: I've made my choice.
Lost.Season01.Episode07 LOCKE: I'm proud of you, Charlie. Always knew you could do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER:  Hell of a book. It's about bunnies.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE:  Must be cold without your trunks.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: You bet. How about you come a little closer and warm me up?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: You sure know how to make a girl feel special, Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: You're incredible Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: I love you. Look at you. What do you want, right now?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: How could I want anything else?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: Oh, uh-oh, baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Oh, what.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: I thought you had a meeting.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Yeah, but it's not until 3:30.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: Baby, it's 3:28.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Damn it. Damn it. Baby, why don't you just, uh...
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: No, just go. You go, okay, I'll stay here -- order room service, get fat.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Why don't you order a chocolate sundae -- when I get back, I'll use you as a dish.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: You weren't exactly supposed to see that.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: What are you doing in my stuff, son?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: This is going to hurt. Ready to tell me what happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: We were trying to find the source of the distress call. I saw the flare from the beach and then the flare from Sawyer's position in the jungle. I switched on my antenna, activated the transceiver, and then -- darkness. Whoever hit me came from behind.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: And destroyed the equipment?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Listen, we're going to figure this out, but don't do anything...
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: I will do whatever I need to do to find the man responsible.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SHANNON: We need some help over here.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: Morning delivery.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: Awww, you're sweet, thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: Well, I figured in your condition, with the extra baggage, you know...
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: Well, I can still walk.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: Barely. Anyway, I worry about you out here. You know, it's very -- sunny.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: Thus, my hat.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: There's plenty of hats in the caves. And we've got a doctor there, as well. That'll come in handy.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: I like the beach, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: Yeah, who wouldn't want to spend the day with sand fleas.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: I want to be here -- for when we get rescued.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: When we get rescued, right.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: Jack, it's fine. It's just a scrape.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Yeah, lot's of scrapes today. I'm running out of peroxide.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: He just jumped me man. I didn't...
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: Shannon has asthma.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Asthma?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: I've never seen her have an attack before.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: Because she had an inhaler. She's sneaks hits when no one's looking. She's been embarrassed about it since she was a little kid. I guess breathing's not cool.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Had an inhaler?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: It ran out a couple of days ago. But I had 4 refills which should have been enough for a couple of months. But she always forgets her medication so I put it my suitcase. Today I see that jackass reading Watership Down.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: You're losing me.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: It was in my bags, the stuff that I checked. If he has my book he has my luggage, if he has the luggage he has the inhalers. Her breathing got really rough today, man. If she has an attack, it's not going to be good.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Where is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Hey, Doc. Long time no see.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Where is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Where's what?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: The girl's asthma medicine. Shannon -- her inhalers.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Oh, that.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: You attacked a kid for trying to help his sick sister.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: No, I whooped a thief cuz he was going through my stuff.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Yours? What makes it yours? What, you think you can just take something out of a suitcase and that makes it yours?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Which I had to move because everybody just wants to help themselves. Look, I don't know what kind of commie share-fest you're running over in cave town, but down here possession's 9/10ths. And a man's got a right to protect his property.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Get up.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Why, you want to see who's taller?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Get up.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: You sure you want to make this your problem, Doc?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Oh yeah. I'm sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: Hey, what's going on here?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: You told me you were going to Baton Rouge to close a deal.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Just trust me, there isn't any time to explain. I'm already late. I miss this meeting, the whole deal's a bust, alright? That's everything I have. 140,000 dollars. There's an oil mining operation in the Gulf of Mexico -- drilling platforms. 300,000 dollars buys one share, but as soon as you invest a Government sponsored fund kicks in and triples your money in two weeks. Triples it.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: 300,000?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: You've got 140.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: I found an investor in Toronto -- wants in 50/50. In two weeks we'll be splitting almost a million bucks. Jess, this is my chance.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: There's another option.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Yeah, and what's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: That I give you the 160,000 and we split the profit.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Yeah, and how in the hell are you going to scare up 160,000 bucks?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: My husband.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: I'm going to kill him.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: That's not going to help us get the medicine.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Maybe not, but it'll feel good.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: So what's stopping you?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: We're not savages, Kate. Not yet.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: Let me talk to Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: What makes you think he's going to listen to you?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: He says we have a connection.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Do you?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: Please.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: What do you want?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Excuse me?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: What do you want, Sawyer?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Freckles, I got so many answers to that question, I wouldn't even know where to start.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: What do you want for the inhalers?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Ah, good question. Hang on a tick. What do I want? A kiss ought to do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: A kiss, from you, right now?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: I don't buy it.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Buy what?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: The act. You try too hard, Sawyer. I ask you to help a woman who can't breath and you want me to kiss you? Nobody's that disgusting. I've seen you, you know.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Seen me what?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: With that piece of paper -- the one you keep in your pocket. Seen the expression on your face when you read it and how carefully you fold it up. It means something to you. So you can play games all you want, but I know there's a human being in there somewhere. Give me the medication.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: You think you understand me?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: Yeah. I think I have...
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Shut up. You want to know what kind of human being I am?  Read it. Read it. Out loud.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: Dear Mr. Sawyer, you don't know who I am but I know who you are and I know what you done. You had sex with my mother and then you stole my dad's money all away. So he got angry and he killed my mother and then he killed himself, too.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Don't stop now. You're just getting to the good part.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: All I know is your name. But one of these days I'm going to find you and I'm going to give you this letter so you'll remember what you done to me. You killed my parents, Mr. Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Now about that kiss... I didn't think so.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: Locke, where were you last night, around sunset?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 LOCKE: Well, I'm afraid the only witness to my whereabouts is the boar that I was skinning for our dinner. I heard you were trying to send out a distress call. So it would seem whoever attacked you has a reason for not wanting to get off the Island. Maybe someone who is profiting from our current circumstances? And from what I've seen you and Mr. Sawyer share a certain animosity.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: No, he has an alibi. Just before I was struck, he set off a bottle rocket, a signal we had worked out -- 2 kilometers away. He wouldn't have the time to go...
Lost.Season01.Episode08 LOCKE: Unless he found a way to time delay the fuse on his rocket.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: How could he possibly have...
Lost.Season01.Episode08 LOCKE: Anyone who watches television knows how to improvise a slow fuse. Use a cigarette.  Just in case there's a next time.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: Just try to breathe. Breathe. Come on Shann work with me.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Give me the inhalers -- now.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Hell, I wondered when you were going to stop asking nice.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, it's about time, cowboy. Been telling you since day one, we're in the wild. Didn't think you had it in you.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: That all you got?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: I'm not sure this is such a good idea.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: Why not?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Because business between friends is always a little sticky. I don't know you well, but I know your wife. Working with her at the auto dealership, I'm just not sure I'm comfortable.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: Louisiana will invest two thirds of the drilling costs. What is this? A loophole?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Look, David, you're reluctant. I get it. You got your lumbar yard, you don't need this.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: You should do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: Jess, I don't even know this guy.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: Show him the cash.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: How do I know this is real?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: The money? Hell, how about you hold on to it for a night. Check it out. I want you to feel secure. You know what? Let's not do this. I've got another investor who's already committed.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: David?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER:  This should cover lunch. And I'll see you Monday . David.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: David?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: Wait.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: Warm fluffy towels. Your turn.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: Uh, banoffee pie.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: You already said that.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: Toffee and cream, mmmm.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: Is food the only thing that you miss?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: You're pregnant. I mean, do you not crave anything? Pickles, fried ice cream, chocolate?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: Peanut butter. I'm the only Australian who loves peanut butter.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: I could get you peanut butter.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: Yeah, sure you can.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: Yes, I can. And when I get you peanut butter you have to vacate this sandy shore of depression and move to the caves. Deal?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: Deal.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: Help, she's not breathing! The attacks are getting worse.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Shannon, listen to me. Look at me, look at me. You need to listen now. This isn't just the asthma, it's anxiety. It's in your head.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SHANNON: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Yes. You know that your medicine's run out and you're panicking. Shannon, Shannon, look at me. We can fight this, together, okay? Nod your head, Shannon. Good. Breathe in through...
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: She needs her inhaler.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Boone!  Breathe in through your nose, slowly. No, no, no. In through the nose, like this. You can do this Shannon. You can do it. In through the nose. You got your breath. Yeah. Your color's coming back. See, I knew you could do this. Do you feel it?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SHANNON: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: It's passing. Okay. Again, in through the nose. Alright, just keep doing that. Keep breathing like that. That's perfect, good job.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Keep her relaxed. Do not let her panic.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: Yeah. Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 HURLEY: Wow, man. That was awesome. I mean, that was like a -- Jedi moment.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: Jack, what will happen if she doesn't get the medicine?  Then we have to make Sawyer give it to us.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: No, not you, me. I served 5 years in the Republican Guard.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: I thought you were a communications officer?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: Part of my training entailed getting the enemy to communicate. Just give me 10 minutes with him. He'll give us the medicine.  Is that a yes?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK:  Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 HURLEY: Food from the plane's been gone for over a week, dude.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: What, no secret stash for emergencies? You and Jack have got a bunch of stuff in that cave.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 HURLEY: Sorry, man. No peanut butter. No peanuts. No nothing.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: Yeah, but, there's got to be something. I mean, look at you.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 HURLEY: Look at what?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: No, no. Listen.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 HURLEY: Fat guy hoarding the food, is that what you think?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: No. It's just we've been here for two weeks and you've not really...
Lost.Season01.Episode08 HURLEY: Slimmed down much?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: All I need is a bag of peanuts.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 HURLEY: I have no food, alright?! And for the record, I'm down a notch in my belt. I'm a big guy, it's going to be a while before you're going to want to give me a piggy back ride, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: Sorry. Sorry, that was bad form.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 HURLEY: Yeah. I'm used to it.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: So, not even a bag of...
Lost.Season01.Episode08 HURLEY: Dude.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: Okay. Alright, I'm sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 MICHAEL: Aaah, damn, stupid...
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SUN: Michael -- the sick girl. 
Lost.Season01.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yeah. Asthma.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SUN: Yes, asthma. I think I can help her.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID:  Good morning.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: What are you doing? Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: This was Sawyer's choice, not mine.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: If you do this!
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, ain't you the brave one, jumping a guy while he's napping. Uh-oh, I'm in trouble now, ain't I?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Sawyer, I'm giving you the chance to do the right thing. Now, all I want is the asthma medicine. Just tell me where the inhalers are and we'll stop.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Stop what, Chico?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: It doesn't have to be this way.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Yeah, it does.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: We do not have bamboo in Iraq, although we do have something similar -- reeds. But their effect is the same when the shoots are inserted underneath the fingernails.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: You know what I think, Ali. I think you've never actually tortured anybody in your life.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: Unfortunately for us both, you're wrong.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: That's it? That's all you got? Splinters? No wonder we kicked your ass in the Gulf... 
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Sayid. Sayid!
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: No. Don't stop now. I think my sinuses are clearing.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: What the hell is wrong with you?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: Perhaps losing an eye will loosen your tongue?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Okay, okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: Where is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: The only person I'll tell is her.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Kate?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: That's the deal.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KILO: Tell me Sawyer, do you want to die? Because when a man walks in my place and tells me he left a 160,000 of my hard won dollars in the care of a civilian I've got to ask myself if what I'm hearing isn't the desperate cry for the sweet release of death.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Deal closed today. See, women are easy -- a few cosmos, a couple of stunts they haven't seen between the sheets, and they think the scam's their idea. Now husbands, they need to touch the money, smell it -- believe that if they had the brass to put that suitcase in the trunk of their family sedan and speed away, they just might have a chance at being an honest-to-gosh outlaw.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KILO: Okay, Tex. You got your grift so pat, what'd you need my money for? Where's your seed from the last couple you roped?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, what can I say? I like earning it as much as I like spending it.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KILO: Be that as it may, I know a thing or two about making people suffer. Now you have my money, plus 50%, by noon tomorrow or I'll tell you all about it.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: So I'm here. Where is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Happy to tell you, as soon as I get that kiss.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: What? Are you serious?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Baby, I am tied to a tree in a jungle of mystery. I just got tortured by a damn spinal surgeon and a gen-u-ine I-raqi. Of course, I'm serious. You're just not seeing the big picture here, Freckles. You really going to let that girl suffocate because you can't bring yourself to give me one little kiss? Hell, it's only first base. Lucky for you I ain't greedy.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: I don't have it.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: The medicine. I don't have it, never did.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: The book -- they said you found it in their luggage.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: The book washed up on shore, went in the drink with the rest of-
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: He doesn't have it.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: He's lying. Can't you see that? He's been lying from the beginning. He doesn't want us to get off this Island. That's why he attacked me.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Hold on a minute.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: He destroyed the transceiver!
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: You don't know that. Sayid!
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: You hit an artery.  Keep still damn it. Sayid, I need my stuff from the caves, my leather backpack. Go.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: Can you make it stop?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE:  Whose blood is that? Whose blood is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: You went after Sawyer and you didn't even tell me? She's my sister.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SHANNON: Boone, don't leave me alone, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE: I'm not going anywhere, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SHANNON: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 MICHAEL:  Are these the right ones? I think I found the right tree, but I'm guessing.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SUN:  Just let me see. Oh yes, good.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JIN:  이 놈이랑 뭐하고 있어! 이 놈이랑 왜 몰래 웃는거지? 응? 뭐야! (What are you doing with him? Why are you sneaking around with
this man? What’s going on?)
Lost.Season01.Episode08 MICHAEL: Don't, man. I'm telling you, don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Let go. I know you want to.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK: Shut up. And stop moving.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: You've been waiting for this, haven't you? Now you get to be the hero again, because that's what you do -- fix everything up all nice. Tell him to let go, Freckles. We already made out, what else I got to live for? Hey, Jack, there's something you should know -- if the tables were turned, I'd watch you die.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Alrighty. It looks like we're in the oil business.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: We're cool?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Oh, we're cool.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: We get the money back?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Week from tomorrow, tripled.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: You're not going to skip town, are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: David, for god's sake, he left all his money with us. We could've skipped town.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Smart woman you got there, David. Don't let her go.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: Hi, baby. What are you doing up? Are you feeling better?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOY: Will you read to me?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: In a minute sweetheart. We have company right now.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: You okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Deal's off.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: Excuse me?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Deal's off, forget it.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: Hold on, what is this, a joke?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: I'm calling it off, walking away.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: You're not walking out of here. You know what I had to do for this? All this money in one day?!
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Take your hand off me, boy.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: Sawyer?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: What's going on here?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JESS: This isn't how is was supposed to work. You said that we were...!
Lost.Season01.Episode08 DAVID: Said? What'd he say Jessica?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: You're lucky to be alive.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: Went to the caves to check on Shannon.  I read it again, and then again, because I've been trying to figure out why you beat up Boone instead of just telling him you didn't have his sister's medication. Why you pretended to have it anyway. The thing that I keep coming back around to is that you want to be hated. Then I looked at the envelope -- America's bicentennial, Knoxville, TN. You were just a kid, 8 maybe 9 years old.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: This letter wasn't written to you. You wrote this letter. Your name's not Sawyer, is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAWYER: It was his name. He was a confidence man. Romanced my momma to get to the money, wiped them out clean, left a mess behind. So I wrote that letter. I wrote it knowing one day I'd find him. But that ain't the sad part. When I was 19, I needed 6 grand to pay these guys off I was in trouble with. So I found a pretty lady with a dumb husband who had some money. And I got them to give it to me. How's that for a tragedy? I became the man I was hunting. Became Sawyer. Don't you feel sorry for me. . Get the hell out. Get out!
Lost.Season01.Episode08 BOONE:  I don't know. It's a miracle. She just showed up with that mixture. She rubbed it on Shannon's chest and 10 minutes later she was breathing.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 JACK:  Eucalyptus -- smart, Jack.  Thank you, very much.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: Packing your stuff, you're moving to the caves.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: You didn't? Peanut butter? No way.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: Just like you ordered. Oh, there is one thing. It's extra smooth.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: That's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CLAIRE: It's empty.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 CHARLIE: What? No, no it's not. It's full, full to the brim, with stick to the roof of your mouth, oh, god, makes you want a glass of milk extra smooth. It's the best bloody peanut butter I've ever tasted. You want some? 
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: Sayid?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: I can't stay here.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: I'm leaving. I don't know for how long.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: Sayid, you can't. We still don't know what's out there.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: I've worse things to fear than what's in the jungle. What I did today, what I almost did, I swore to do never again. If I can't keep that promise, I have no right to be here.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 KATE: There's nowhere to go.
Lost.Season01.Episode08 SAYID: Someone has to walk the shore and map the Island, see what else there is. I can't think of a better person to do it than the only one I trust. I hope we meet again.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAWYER: Ow, easy, Jackass.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: You want it easy, quit moaning. I've got to change these bandages.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAWYER: Well, try not taking my skin off with them. How'd I score the house call, Dr. Quinn. Trying to ease your conscience?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: My conscience is fine, thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAWYER: Of course, what do you have to feel guilty about? I mean, you just let that damn Arab torture me -- stood by and watched. You figure you patch me up -- buy you a ticket into heaven? Only reason you're here...
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: I'm here because no one else wants anything to do with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAWYER: She does.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Change your own bandages.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Looking for someone, or just admiring the view?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 KATE: It's been two days since Sayid took off on his own. I keep looking up, thinking I'm going to see him coming back.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: He'll come back when he's found what he's looking for -- the French transmission.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 KATE: He isn't looking for anything. He left because of what happened -- for what he did.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: It was an accident.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 KATE: Well, accidents happen when you torture people, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Sayid's a trained soldier, Kate. He can take care of himself.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Hello? Hello?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 .
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: What's going on out there?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Uh, you know, the usual -- people yelling at each other over nothing.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SULLIVAN (a redshirt): Doc, what do you think this is, this, this, this, uh, rash. It's bad, right, like some kind of a tropical disease?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: It's hives.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SULLIVAN: What's that? Is that like poison ivy?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: It's a common rash, Sullivan. It's brought on by heat and stress.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SULLIVAN: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Just try to relax; it'll clear up.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SULLIVAN: Right.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Try to keep your mind off it.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SULLIVAN: Okay,  What is that? Is it like aloe? Isn't that for sunburn, or something?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Try to keep your mind off it? What else has that guy got to do but stress?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: I've got enough on my plate without having to treat hypochondriacs.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Yeah, but that's like my point, man. We're all fried. I'm mean, have you taken a look at everybody out there? Everybody's way tense. Dude, I'm just saying, it'd be sweet if we could have, I don't know, something to do.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: We're surviving here Hurley, and that's what my main concern is, keeping us alive. Things could be worse.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: How?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: What? Who are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Where is Alex?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I don't know what you're talking about.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Where is Alex?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Please listen...
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Where is Alex?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I don't know any Alex.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Stop!
Lost.Season01.Episode09 PRISONER: Stop.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Arabic [تريدني أن أتوقف، فالح؟ إذا أجب عن أسئلتي لأنني يمكنني فعل هذا كل يوم. أؤكد لك بأننا نعرف مسبقا الحقيقة. لكننا نريد أن تعترف بنفسك...

Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID:  And all the pain will stop. Your Shiite friends have already implicated you in the bombing.  You planted the device in the Baathist headquarters, didn't you? You killed two soldiers.  Confess it. Confess it, and perhaps it will only cost you your hands instead of your life.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: He doesn't know anything. Your sources were wrong.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR: Perhaps. But that's really not the point, is it? You handled yourself very well in there.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Did I?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR: I'll put in for your reassignment to Intelligence Division, if you wish it.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Yes, sir, very much so.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR: Good, now stop calling me sir when it's just the two of us.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: You're my superior officer, Omar -- for now.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR: And I'll enjoy it while it lasts.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR: That reminds me, Sayid. In addition to your increased responsibility... Communications officer... 
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I'm willing to make that sacrifice.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 ETHAN: Hi
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Yo. What's this?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 LOCKE: They were in the jungle. They must have fallen from the plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: What are you guys doing out in the jungle at night?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 ETHAN: Best time to hunt.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 LOCKE: Ethan here has some experience -- spotted some tracks, looked like they might be rabbit or some other rodent.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Rodent, yum.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 ETHAN: Figured people are starting to get tired of eating boar meat.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: You got that right. Alright, well, I'll take a look at these , and see if there's anything useful.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 ETHAN: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 WALT: Mr. Locke, are you going back out to hunt?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 LOCKE: For a bit.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 WALT: Can I go with you? I mean, I just want to learn how to do what you do-
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL:  Walt!
Lost.Season01.Episode09 WALT: I was just. I was talking to Mr. Locke and...
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: I know what you're doing. It's not going to happen, man. Get back to bed.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY:  Whoa, dude. 
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Please just listen to me! I keep telling you I don't know who Alex is! I'm a survivor of a plane crash. I found a wire on the beach, I followed it. I thought it might have something to do with the transmission we picked up on our receiver. A recording, a mayday, with a French woman repeating on a loop for 16 years.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Si quelqu'un m'entend, je vous en prie, venez à notre aide... Il les a tués. Il les a tous tués...   16 years. Has it really been that long?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: You.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: You just happened to hear my distress call? I know what you are. 
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Rousseau.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: How do you know my name?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I read it. There, on the jacket.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: What is this place? Those batteries -- they wouldn't be able to produce enough power to transmit your distress call all these years.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: It broadcasts from somewhere else. But they control it now.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: They?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: You. And the others like you.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I don't know who you think I am. I've already told you I'm not...
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Sayid?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: How do you know my name?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: My name was on a jacket, your's is on the envelope you carry. Who is she? The woman in the photographs.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Nadia. Her name is Nadia.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR: We cannot tie Noor Abed-Jazeem directly to the bombing, but we know where her sympathies lie. She's a known associate of Kurdish and Shiite insurgents.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: You think she knows who orchestrated the bombing?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR: That, my friend, is exactly what you will find out.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Noor Abed-Jazeem, I'm going to ask you some questions. If you refuse to cooperate I'm going to hurt you. Do you understand?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: Nobody calls me Noor, Sayid. You of all people should know that.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: What? You don't remember me? Am I so different from the little girl in the school yard who used to push you in the mud?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Nadia?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: And your mother would tell my mother, "why must you pick on little Sayid." And I'd answer, because he ignores me.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: You had enough attention with your family's wealth and your charm.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: Such things matter little to children. But then you always were older than your years, weren't you, Sayid?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Not old enough to understand that being pushed in the mud was a sign of affection. Now you're a traitor to your country. Tell me what you know about the bombing in Najaf. Tell me, or I swear I will hurt you.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: Oh, I know Sayid. This is not my first interrogation by the Republican Guard. This is where they burned me with acid -- they pierced my hands with a drill. Would you like to see the soles of my feet? Where they flayed the skin off? These are the handiworks of your friends. The people you swear allegiance to.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: If you were innocent, I am sorry. But this bombing is a different matter, Nadia.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: Go on, Sayid, do your work. I'm not going to tell you anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Then I'm going to hurt you.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: I know.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: You have a bullet wound.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I was a soldier.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: You were. And are you still?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: That was a long time ago.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Tell me more about her, the woman -- Nadia.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Alex. Who is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 WALT: I'm bored. Can I take Vincent to the beach?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: I'll take you later, man. I'm in the middle of something.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 WALT: But there's nothing to do around here.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: Well, you've got to figure out stuff to do. You know what I'm saying? You've got to find a way to entertain yourself.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY:  Come on. Come on. I know I saw it.  Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Hurley, uh...
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Hold on, man. I'm busy.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY:  Dude, can I borrow this?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY:  Thanks, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Hurley, what are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: So, you heard my transmission -- came looking for me, for answers?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I didn't know you were alive.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Still lying.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I'm not lying.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Lies!
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Nothing...
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE:  Like this plane crash which you survived. You claim there were others?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: More than 40, yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Then why are you alone?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I left them.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: There was -- I did something, something I'm ashamed of.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: But Nadia, you left her, too?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: She wasn't on the plane. She's dead -- because of me.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE:  I'm so sorry. I want to show you something.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: See, this junction here -- re-route some of the spring's water flow into a couple of suspended basins, pop in some hose, you got showers. This way you keep the drinking water separate.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: This is -- you drew this?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: I was an artist in a previous life.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: I thought you were in construction.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: I am. I mean, I was -- long story.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 CHARLIE: Hey, Jack. Hurley's all worked up about something, said we should come see it.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Welcome, to the first, and hopefully last, Island Open.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: It's two holes for now, 3 par, and no waiting.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Hurley, you built a golf course?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Rich idiots fly to tropical islands all the time to whack balls around.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: All the stuff we've got to deal with, man -- this is what you've been wasting your time on?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Dudes, listen. Our lives suck. Everyone's nerves are stretched to the max. I mean, we're lost on an Island, running from boars and monsters -- freakin' polar bears!
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: Polar bears?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 CHARLIE: You didn't hear about the polar bear?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Look, all I'm saying is, if we're stuck here, then just surviving's not going to cut it. We need some kind of relief, you know. We need some way that we can, you know, have fun. That's right, fun. Or else we're just going to go crazy waiting for the next bad thing to happen.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: It's a music box, but it's broken. It has been for a long time. It was a gift from my love for our anniversary.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: You mean Alex?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Robert. This was such a comfort to me in the first few years here.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I could fix it for you. I could take a look at it, if you freed my hands.  I'm very good with mechanical things. I need my hands.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: What is written on the back of your photograph?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Did she write it? Or did you? Perhaps you don't want to tell me because it causes too much pain.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Rousseau, you don't need to do that.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: This is a problem, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: I mean, I know what I'd do, but it's got to be your call.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Okay, give me a seven iron.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: You got it.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK:  Hey, heads up over there!
Lost.Season01.Episode09 CHARLIE: No chance, you won't get anywhere near us!
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SULLIVAN:  Hey, Doc? There you are. Somebody said you went this way. Listen, that rash of mine, it's starting to spread. It's like the size of a grape. What are you guys doing? Are you playing golf?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SULLIVAN: Can I play?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Sorry about the sedative. It was the only safe way for me to move you. You offered to fix my music box after all I've done to you -- striking you, shocking you. Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Do you want me to fix your music box, or don't you?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Yes. Yes, please.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Then I want to know your name. Your first name.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Danielle. My name is Danielle.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID:  And how did you come to be on this Island, Danielle?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: We were part of a science team.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: A science team armed with rifles? Was Robert on the team?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: And Alex, was he, too?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Our vessel was 3 days out of Tahiti when our instruments malfunctioned. It was night, a storm, the sounds. The ship slammed into rocks, ran aground, the hull breached beyond repair. So, we made camp, dug out this temporary shelter. Temporary. Nearly 2 months we survived here, 2 months before --
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Your distress signal? The message I heard, you said, "It killed them all."
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: We were coming back from the Black Rock. It was them. They were the carriers.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Who were the carriers?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: The others.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: What others? What is the Black Rock? Have you seen other people on this Island?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: No, but I hear them. Out there, in the jungle. They whisper.  You think I'm insane.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I think you've been alone for too long.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID:  I'm sorry, this is all I could find. I'll try and bring you some fruit later on. Are you ready to talk?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: That depends on what you'd like to talk about, Sayid. Books, weather? Since I've seen neither locked in this cell for weeks, I'm afraid my conversation will suffer.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: We have two suspects in custody. Have a look at these photographs. All you need to do is nod. If you prove you are willing to cooperate, I think I can get them to free you.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: Then I won't have these visits to look forward to anymore.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: This isn't a game, Nadia.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: Yet, you keep playing it, Sayid -- pretending to be something I know you're not.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 BOONE: You're never going to believe this.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SHANNON: You finally learned how to tie your own shoes?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 BOONE: Funny. Someone at the caves built a golf course.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SHANNON: Are you high?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 BOONE: Seriously, a golf course. Apparently, Jack's playing with them right now.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 KATE: Jack? Is golfing?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 BOONE: That's what I hear. I don't know about you guys but I'm going to go check this out.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SHANNON: Wait for me, bonehead.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAWYER: Doctor playing golf. Woo, boy howdy, now I've heard everything. What's next, cop eating a donut?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 KATE: You want to come you should just say.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAWYER: I think I'll pass on that, Freckles. Not big on crowds. And let's face it, the crowd's not too hot on me, either.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 KATE: One outcast to another -- I'd think about making more of an effort.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAWYER: Duly noted.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: You see, some things can be fixed.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Danielle, please let me go.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Go?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Back to the people I told you about.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: You can't. You have to stay. It's not safe.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Not safe, what's not safe?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: You need me! You can't leave.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Danielle...
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Where are you going?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: If we're lucky, it's one of the bears.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: If we're lucky? It might be that thing out there -- the monster.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: There's no such thing as monsters.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR: You have to execute her.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR: The Jazeem woman has given us nothing. This will send a message to the others who will not talk.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I just need more time with her.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR: You have had more than a month, Sayid. Now bring her outside and shoot her. Or I will. Is this a problem?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: No, it's not a problem.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR: Good.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: What did you bring me today?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Put it on.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: Are you going to hurt me, Sayid?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 CHARLIE: Ugh!
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Dude, I think he stuck it.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 CHARLIE: Lucky, lucky.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 KATE: This thing have a ladies team?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Hey, when did you show up?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 KATE: A while ago. I almost didn't recognize you. You're smiling.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: I'll have to watch that.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 KATE: So how'd you come up with this?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 JACK: Wasn't me -- it's all Hurley. I've been going crazy trying to make everyone feel safe. I haven't been sleeping because I want everyone to feel safe. And he builds a golf course and everyone feels safe.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY:  Aw, crap, do over.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 CHARLIE: It's a mulligan, mulligan. It's a gentleman's sport, you've got to get the words right. Mulligan.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 WALT: Dad.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: Hey, come here. Check this out.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 CHARLIE:  You want to -- let me.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Dude, get away from me.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 WALT: You left me alone at the caves.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: What? I left you with Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 WALT: She's sleeping.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: Oh, man. I'm sorry. I just... I just got caught up. I'm really sorry Walt. I screwed up. I'll make it up to you. Hey, you want to play?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 WALT: Nah, there's other people waiting.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: Oh no, don't worry about it, they won't mind. You want to take a swing?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 CHARLIE: Michael, it's your shot. You're up.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: Oh, okay, cool.  So we'll play later, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Put the gun down, Danielle. Put it down on the ground.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID:  I'll take it from here.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA:  What's... what's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: 40 meters outside this door there's a supply truck that will be leaving shortly. They don't check them on the way out, only coming in. Get inside. Cover yourself any way that you can. They won't reach the city for 30 minutes, that's enough time for you to jump out and hide yourself.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: Come with me.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I can't. Desertion. They would kill my family. I don't have your courage.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: You have more than you know.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Nadia, you have to go.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR:  Sayid. What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 OMAR:  Guards!
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: Sayid, now you have to come with me! They'll kill you!
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: No, you escaped, you stole my gun and you shot him. And then you shot me.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 NADIA: Sayid!
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID:  Take it. Please, Nadia. Take it and go.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Please, I don't wish to hurt you.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: You already have.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: The firing pin has been removed. Robert didn't notice it was missing, either -- when I shot him.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: But you loved him.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: He was sick.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Sick?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: It took them, one after the other. I had no choice. They were already lost.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: You killed them?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: What would have happened if we were rescued? I couldn't let that happen. I won't!
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: I'm not sick.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: I know.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Then why kill me?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: I can't let you go. Don't you understand, to have someone to talk to, to touch --
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: "You'll find me in the next life if not in this one."
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: The writing on the back of Nadia's photograph. I know what it's like to hold on to someone. I've been holding on for the past 7 years to just a thought, a blind hope that somewhere she's still alive. But the more I hold on, the more I pull away from those around me. The only way out of this, this place, is with their help. Come with me. You don't have to be alone, Danielle.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Your people -- the ones you're determined to get back to -- watch them, watch them closely.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAYID: Danielle, who is Alex?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 DANIELLE: Alex was my child.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 CHARLIE: Guys, please. I've never made par on a course before.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Dude, you were robbed.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 CHARLIE: Bollocks. See that?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 MICHAEL: Okay, Jack. It's up to you. Sink this you get to wear the blazer.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 KATE: No pressure.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 CHARLIE: Yeah, no pressure.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: 5 bucks says he sinks it.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 CHARLIE: Hey, you're betting against me?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 HURLEY: Sorry, dude, but you're a duffer like me.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 BOONE: Make it 10 and you're on.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SULLIVAN: I don't have any cash, but I'll bet my dinner on the Doc.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SAWYER: I've two tubes of sunscreen and a flashlight says he chokes.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 KATE: I'll take that action.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 BOONE: Yeah, yeah, me too.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 SHANNON: You just bet on Jack, dumb-ass.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 BOONE: We need the sunscreen, Princess.
Lost.Season01.Episode09 LOCKE: Does your father know you're here?
Lost.Season01.Episode09 WALT:  Can you teach me how to do that?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 . We hear the sound of a sword being unsheathed. There is wind and motion in the trees.]
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: What's happening?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LOCKE: You know what's happening.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: But I don't understand. Why --?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LOCKE: He was your responsibility but you gave him away, Claire. Everyone pays the price now.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: It's alright. Hey, hey, you're dreaming. You were sleep-walking, alright? . Claire, what happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: That must have been a hell of a nightmare.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Who said it was a nightmare?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: I'd say when someone makes their fists so tight they dig their fingernails a quarter of an inch into their palm they probably weren't dreaming about riding ponies. Did you ever sleep-walk before?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: No. I don't think so. How would I know?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: It'll get back to you. I had a girlfriend once that told me I talked in my sleep.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: What did you say?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Don't know. Whatever it was she didn't like it. How was your OB-GYN in Sydney?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Good. She was good.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: She was okay with letting you fly in your third trimester?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Yeah, I went for a checkup the week before and she said it'd be fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Ultrasound was cool?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Uh-huh. Very healthy.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: How have you been feeling?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Okay. Back's pretty sore, but it's probably just from sleeping on the ground. I get dizzy if I stand up too fast. And I have to pee all the time.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Are you eating enough?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Boar and bananas.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: How many weeks in are you? What was the date that you found out you were pregnant.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Is it pink?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I don't know yet.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: I mean, did you actually pee on it?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I don't know, just give me a second.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Maybe you didn't do it right.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Thomas, I can pee on a stick.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Okay, well, what color is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: How long's it been?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: 6 -- 66 seconds. Oh god. . Okay, it's definitely two lines.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Two pink lines?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Pink? No, no, no, these are, like, red.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: What?  They're pink.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: These two lines?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: They're pink.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Okay, first of all these tests are not always accurate.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Thomas.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: No, no, no, my uncle he thought he had testicular cancer, remember that.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: He did. He's dead.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Yeah. I mean, no, no. It was like the wrong -- it was a bad diagnosis. Look, this thing, it doesn't mean for sure that you're pregnant.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Thomas --
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: We can go get another one.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I am six weeks late, okay. Six weeks. That never happens. I'm pregnant.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Okay. Okay. Look, it's all going to be okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I know. I know.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Hey, Claire? If we, if we wanted to we could do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Stop it.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: No. I'm not kidding.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: My mom would disown me.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: She basically has already.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Yeah. But with what? My... my five dollar an hour job at Fish and Fry?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: You're not the only one with a job, you know. I mean, I've got my painting.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: That's sweet, but this isn't what we want.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Maybe it is. This could be like, uh, I don't know. It could be like the best thing ever.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: You, you really want to try?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Yeah. Claire, I love you.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Well, this is a first -- you standing still, middle of the day, doing nothing. Amazing.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 KATE: I'm doing something.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Yeah, what's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 KATE: I'm sinking. Water goes out, takes the sand with it and you sink. I used to do it with my mom when I was a kid.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Ah, new plan. You're going to just sink your way right off the Island. Sayid would be proud.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 KATE: He's been gone for almost a week.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Something tells me he'll be okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 KATE: So what are you doing this far from the caves?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Bringing water down, bringing fish back. Claire's going to have the baby soon.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: "Dear diary, still on the bloody Island. Today I swallowed a bug. Love, Claire."  Here, what separates us from these savage Yanks if we can't drink tea? Feeling better?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: It was just a dream.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Mmmmm. I have this dream... I'm driving a bus and my teeth start falling out. My mom's in the back eating biscuits. Everything smells of bacon. It's weird. Of course, I don't wake up screaming.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I'm alright, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: No, of course you are. It's just, I think about you in this place -- how hard it must be for you without your family and your friends. And I think we could be friends. I could be your friend. We don't have to do each other's hair or anything. I just mean that if you needed someone to talk to about anything, I'm here.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Okay -- .
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I didn't mean that --
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: It's cool, Claire. It's cool.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Thomas cleaned out his whole loft. I'm officially moving in on Tuesday.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 RACHEL: That is great.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I know. He's awesome. . You know, maybe we shouldn't --
Lost.Season01.Episode10 RACHEL: No, you're not backing out now.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: It's seems --
Lost.Season01.Episode10 RACHEL: He's just a psychic, Claire. I mean, I thought you were all into this, all your astrology stuff.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Yeah, I know, but I don't need somebody telling me what's going to happen or how to live my life.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 RACHEL: It's not about what you need. It's about what's fun. So unless you have another excuse --
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: I'll need your hands for this.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: Ah, so when did you find out?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: About the baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Two days ago.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 RACHEL: She hasn't told her mom yet. We're afraid she might -- .
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: What? Should I not tell her?  What? What is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: I'm sorry.  I can't, I can't --
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: What were you gonna -- what did you see?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: I'm... I'm not doing this reading.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: You, you were going to say something.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: You'll have to leave. Now. Thanks, thanks very much.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 RACHEL:  What a freak.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE:  Help me! Somebody's going to hurt me, please, help me.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Someone attacked her.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: He held me down.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MICHAEL: Which way did he go? How long ago?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I don't know. I couldn't see. Just now, just now, he just ran away.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: We should find out, check the surrounding caves.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Hey, wait, wait, hold on don't go --
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Hurley, let's go.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK:  C'mon, c'mon, let's sit down here, okay?  Go get her some water.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Yeah, sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Claire, look at me, it's okay. You're safe now.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MICHAEL: Did you get a look at him, at all?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: No, it was dark. I couldn't see.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Where did this happen?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: It was here. I, I was sleeping and I woke up and he was trying to hurt my baby! He had this... this thing -- like... like a needle. And he stabbed me with it.  He was trying to hurt my baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: It's okay. It's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: We looked around the entire perimeter, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Nobody saw or heard anything?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Uh-uh, nada. Everyone was asleep. So, I had an idea. I'm out here looking for some psycho with Scott and Steve, right? And I'm realizing who the hell are Scott and Steve?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: I'm not following you?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Look, if I was a cop and some woman got attacked, we'd canvas, right? Knock on doors, find witnesses. But we don't even have doors.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Hurley, you're not helping me understand where you're...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Look, we don't know who's living here and who's still at the beach. I mean, we don't even know each other. My name isn't Hurley, it's Hugo Reyes. Hurley's just a nickname I have, alright? Why? I'm not telling. The point is, we've got to find out who everyone is.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: You want to start a census.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Yeah, a registry, you know, names, what people look like, who's related to who. I mean, we start laying down the law, maybe we'll stop attacking each other. It seems like someone's getting punched, or stabbed, or something every other day here. We've got to find out who did this to her.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: You alright?  Don't worry, you want to close your eyes, I'll be here all night. I won't let anyone get to you. I won't leave you, Claire. Promise.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Wow, we have drapes now.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I know it. I feel all grown up. You like them?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Yeah. They're good.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I don't know why drapes represent age for me. I guess it just feels like something my mum would do. Oh, um, Sasha called, they're going out tonight, wanted to know if we'd go.  What? I didn't eat all the chips, there's another bag.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Claire? I can't do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Do what? Did you have a bad day?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: This isn't working. Come on, you knew that.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I what? Um, just so I'm not over-reacting here, are you breaking up with me?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Look, for the past three months, it's just, you know, there's always some plan, some responsibility, somewhere that we have to be, someone that you have to talk to.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Well, yeah, I'm trying to make sure that when the baby comes...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Oh, the baby, yeah, I mean, that is just not -- it's like this now, you know. What's it going to be like when the baby comes?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: But you said we should do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: Yeah, well, now it's real.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Well, you can't just change your mind.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: How in the hell am I supposed to be a dad, Claire? How about my painting, my life?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I knew... I knew this was going to happen.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: I told you so -- terrific. Now I get all your daddy abandonment crap, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Hey, you bastard, don't you dare try and justify what you're doing!
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: I have done nothing, okay. I have done absolutely nothing.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: What?! I have?!
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: You don't think I've seen what you've done?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: You were supposed to be on the pill.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: You think I got pregnant on purpose?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: I don't even care.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Like this was some kind of plan? You are out of your mind!
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: It's over, Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: No, it's not over!
Lost.Season01.Episode10 THOMAS: I'm outta here.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Thomas!
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: John, right? John Locke?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LOCKE: Is this about your census?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Yeah, you know, I thought it'd be a good idea, you know, to get everyone's name and place of residence.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LOCKE: And who's checking on you?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Uh, me?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LOCKE: That was a joke.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Uh, good one.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LOCKE: Yep. You already know my name. I lived most of my life in Tustin, CA.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Cool. And, reason for travel? The reason you were in Australia?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LOCKE: I was looking for something.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Looking, uh-huh. So, did you find it?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LOCKE: No. It found me. Anything else?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY:  No, no. That's good. Uh, thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Hey, uh, I know I already talked to you, but, uh, I just wanted to get away from him fast, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Did you see anyone leave the beach last night?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 KATE: People come and go, but I, I don't know. . What?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: I'm not sure anything actually happened.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Wait, what?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Claire told Michael and I that this attacker tried to inject her with something. But there was no mark on her stomach. She wakes up two nights in a row screaming. The first time she was sleep-walking.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: You think she was making this up? She was terrified, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Look, she said that the guy was trying to hurt her baby. Why would someone do that now with all of us sleeping 20 feet away?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: So, you think she's lying?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: No. Pregnant women have extremely lucid...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Lucid, right.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: These are textbook anxiety nightmares.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: You know everything that's going on with everyone?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 KATE:  Hey.  So what do we do?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: She's due in a little more than a week, maybe two, but if she stays stressed out like this, or has another panic attack it could trigger an early labor. And out here, with no instruments, no monitors, no anesthetic -- that would not be good.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: It's not all in her head.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Hey, Lance.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Sorry?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Lance. Your name's Lance, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Ethan.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Dude, that's right. Lance is the little skinny guy with the glasses and the red hair.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: I can see how you'd confuse us.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Sorry, dude. Lots of names and faces. It's pretty pathetic, huh? You'd think after a couple of weeks on the Island with the same people, we'd all know each other.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Yeah, you're right. You would think so.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: So, we're doing this list, you know, survivors, names, home addresses, stuff like that.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Okay, well, you already have my name...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Not Lance.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Definitely not.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Last name?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Rom.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Rom, R-O-M?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: That's right?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Great, where are you from Ethan Rom?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Ontario.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Right on, love Canada, great uh... well that should do it. Thanks for your time, dude.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Hey, what's this for?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Oh, it's nothing. It's just, uh, you know, I thought I'd be a good idea.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Claire?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Did you find him?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Um, no.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Well, what if he comes back?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Claire, this situation we're in -- the crash, that no one's coming, this place -- it, it can kind of mess with your head a little, and maybe make you see things that aren't actually there. Now, I know it feels very real.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I, I don't understand...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Your baby's coming, soon. And I can't even imagine how scary that must be for you, but the more upset you are, the more dangerous it is for you, and your baby. So, I want you to take these.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: What are they?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: It's a sedative, very mild -- commonly used in situations like yours. It won't harm the baby, I promise.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: You don't believe me.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: You think I'm making this up? I get attacked and you want to give me sleeping pills?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: They're not sleeping p -- look, it's a very mild sedative.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I'm leaving.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: What? No. Claire, Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I was safer at the beach. It's not safe here.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Don't do this, Claire. You need to think about the baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Don't talk to me about the baby. I'm sick of everyone telling me what to do.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK:  Please.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Let go of me.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE:  You okay?  What did you say to her?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: Yes?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Mr. Malkin, we met before.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: Yes. I remember.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: You wouldn't give me a reading. I was hoping you would now.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: If you're psychic, why do you have to count it?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: That's not how it works.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I was just joking.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: So, how does it work?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: I don't know.  Oh, when did he leave you?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Last week. Is that why you didn't want to do my reading last time?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: No, no. I saw something, sort of a blurry thing.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: And, blurry's bad?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: Blurry's bad. That's why I stopped the reading. Are you sure you want to go on now?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Yeah, yes, please.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: I can tell you, this is important.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: It is crucial that you yourself raise this child.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: You mean with Thomas? Is he...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: The father of this child will play no part in it's life, nor yours.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: So what exactly are you saying?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: This child parented by anyone else, anyone other than you -- danger surrounds this baby...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Danger?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: Your nature, your spirit, your goodness, must be an influence in the development of this child.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Look, if Thomas and I don't get back together I'm putting this baby up for adoption. I just wanted to find out what would give the baby the happiest life.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: There is no happy life -- not for this child, not without you.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I don't...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: It can't be another. You mustn't allow another to raise your baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my 200.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: Oh, no look, take it. Ms. Littleton, I am begging you just to consider...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I can't raise this child by myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: You have to listen to me!
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Okay, thanks for your time, and my money back.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: Ms. Littleton, please. The baby needs your protection! Ms. Littleton, please!
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Hello?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: Ms. Littleton, it's Richard Malkin.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Oh, my God.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: Listen to me. I have a plan, something that will make this all better.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: You've got to stop calling me. It's too late, alright. I'm going to see adoptive services tomorrow.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: I've been telling you for months, you cannot do that.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Look, what I do with my baby is none of your business.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: If you don't do what I'm suggesting, great danger will befall...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Hey, great danger will befall you if you don't stop calling me in the middle of the night.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: I know what you're feeling inside, Claire -- that you're doubting your decision to give up the baby. Look, I'm begging you, don't do it. At least hear my plan first.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Good night.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE:  Hi. Where are you going?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Back to the beach.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: What happened? Did Jack...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Jack tried to dope me. He thinks I'm making all this up, that none of it really happened.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Right. So, to prove your sanity you go tromping through the jungle alone. Well done.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I'm not crazy, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SHANNON: You want my information. Name: Shannon Rutherford, Age: 20, Address: Craphole Island.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: So, uh, where were you guys last night?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SHANNON: Um, the beach.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 BOONE: Why the interrogation?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: You're like the 20th person to ask me that. Why is everyone so uptight about answering a few questions?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 BOONE: Well, maybe we're just not cool with you setting up your own little Patriot Act, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SHANNON: He's a liberal.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 BOONE: No, seriously, why the list?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Ah, it's nothing, we just had a little incident in the valley last night.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SHANNON: An incident?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Yeah, Claire, the pregnant girl, you know her, she, uh, kind of got attacked.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SHANNON: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 BOONE: She okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Yeah, she's a little shook up, but...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SHANNON: I am so not moving to the rape caves.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 BOONE:  You know, your life would be so much easier if you just had the manifest as we crossed out all the names of the dead after we burned the fuselage, so it should be a full roster of the rest of us.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: What? Really? Where is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 BOONE: Who do you think?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: I'm just going to lay it out straight.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SAWYER: Okay, you do that.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: I hear you have the flight manifest, and I need it, and I want you to give it to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SAWYER: That so?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Now, you could do what you normally do when someone asks for something -- tell me to screw off.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SAWYER: Screw off?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: Or, you could just give it to me -- because, dude, you could use the points.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SAWYER: Well, gosh, you sure know how to butter a man up, Stay Puft.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: It's a gift.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SAWYER:  Manifest is in the brown suitcase. Take it.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Please let me carry your bag.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I'm fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: I know you're fine, but I can still carry your bag.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Why did you come after me?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Well, it's probably because I like you. What?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: You don't like me, Charlie, okay? You just want to rescue me because, because of this . I'm fine, okay. I don't need rescuing. I don't need... 
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Whoa, Claire. What is it? What, Claire, what, what is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Is that another one?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Okay, we need to time the contractions. That's what you do, time the contractions, okay. One sugar-plum fairy, two sugar-plum fairy...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: You just need to calm down, alright. Big deep breaths. . Oh, bloody hell.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Charlie, I need you to go get Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I'll be alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: I'm not leaving you alone.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Charlie, please just go.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: I can deliver a baby. I can do this. This must happen all the time.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Charlie, you don't know how to deliver a...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Just listen to me. I'm not going to let anything happen to you. I might not know what I'm doing but I'll figure it out. If I can kick drugs I can deliver a baby. Let me explain. I'm a drug addict. I was a drug addict. I'm clean now.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Get Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Right.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LAWYER: Arlene and Joseph will bring you to Melbourne. They'll pay your living and medical expenses.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ARLENE: We found you an apartment. It's a really nice two bedroom place. And, well, we think you're going to be really comfortable in it.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LAWYER: As discussed, once the baby is born and handed over to the Stewarts you'll have no right to see the child again. You'll have no right to correspond with the child. It will be entirely up to Eileen and Joseph to decide whether to tell the child anything about you. Understood?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LAWYER: Upon your discharge from the hospital you'll be given an additional payment of 20,000 dollars.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I just want to make sure that you're going to take really good care of the baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ARLENE: Of course we will.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LAWYER: Now, I'll need you to sign and date here, where indicated.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Do you know "Catch a Falling Star"? It's a song, like a lullaby.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ARLENE: "Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket."
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: My dad used to sing that to me when I was little. Do you think you could sing it to the baby once in a while?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ARLENE: Of course.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: It's not working.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 LAWYER: Here.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I, I'm sorry. I can't do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ARLENE: What? No!
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Okay, what is it? What's your offer.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Oh, thank god. What's your name?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Ethan.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Ethan...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Are you alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: ...you need to go the caves. Run to caves. Get Jack. Tell him that Claire...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Claire. Is she okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: She's having the baby. Go fast, okay? I'll be with her, on the path over there. Go.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Claire?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I'm here.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Claire. Okay, Jack's coming. How are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: It hurts.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Okay, just take my hand. Squeeze. Okay, breathe. Inhale, exhale. Good, just breathe. Inhale, okay, good.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I'm not supposed to be here.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: I think we all feel like that a little bit.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I know, it's just -- someone promised me it would be different.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Well, he was wrong.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Yeah. He was wrong.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: You spent the last 4 months telling me I have to raise the baby myself. Now you're giving me money and saying I don't have to?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: I found a couple in Los Angeles who are very eager to adopt. The baby will be safe in their care. Now, I've foreseen...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Heh, Foreseen? I don't even know why I'm here. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: I know this sounds ridiculous, Claire. All this psychic business, and I appreciate that you must think I'm a raving madman. But this is what must happen.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: So, you're giving me 6000 dollars to give my baby to a couple of strangers in Los Angeles?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: 12,000. The other 6 when you arrive in Los Angeles. And they're not strangers, Claire. They're good people.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: A psychic?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I know. It's embarrassing. And now after everything, he was just full of it.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Or not. I mean, all he wanted was that no one else raise your baby, right? Maybe he knew. I mean, if he wanted it bad enough. You know, if he had the gift, and I believe some people do, maybe he knew, Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I can't go tomorrow. I have to get my...
Lost.Season01.Episode10 MALKIN: It has to be this flight. It can't be any other. They're already scheduled to meet you when you arrive. Flight 815. Flight 815.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: There was no couple in Los Angeles. He knew. He knew about the plane, what was going to happen. Oh my god, he knew.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: You feel another one coming?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: I don't think so.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Where the hell is Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE:  You know, I think, I think I'm alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: The contractions?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Maybe that was the last one? Please let that be the last one.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Jack said that stress can cause false labor. You sure you're alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: No pain.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Birthing emergency averted. I told you I'd take care of you.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Thanks, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: You're quite welcome. You think you can make it back to the caves?  I won't let anything happen to you.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Okay, let's go.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK: Sayid?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SAYID: Listen to me. I found her, the French woman.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 JACK:  I need some water. What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 SAYID: The woman -- on the island. I had to come back. I had to come back. We're not alone.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: You okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CLAIRE: Yeah, yeah. Look, he just kicked, here .
Lost.Season01.Episode10 HURLEY: We've got a problem. The manifest, Jack, the census, the names of everyone who survived, all 46 of us. I interviewed everyone. Here, at the beach, got their names. One them, one of them isn't -- Jack! One of them isn't in the manifest. He wasn't on the plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 ETHAN: Hello there.
Lost.Season01.Episode10 CHARLIE: Ethan, where's Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: He wasn't on the plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Who wasn't on the plane?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: Ethan, the Canadian guy, he is not on the passenger manifest.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Well, where the hell is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: I don't know. I saw him yesterday, but now...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK:  Has anyone seen Ethan?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Sayid's leg.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Has anyone seen Ethan?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah. He went to go get some wood. He took off on the path to the beach. Is he okay? What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Where's Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Where's Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: He went after Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE:  Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: She was moving back to the beach. Claire. That's hers. What happened? What...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: I don't know. Footprints. At least three distinct sets all over the place. It looks like there might have been a struggle.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: What? What is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Drag marks. Here. And here.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Claire and Charlie, they were together.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: I think they've been taken.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK:  Claire!! Charlie! Claire!
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Jack. Jack.  Shhhh.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Tracks are still fresh.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: This doesn't make any sense. How can one man drag off two people, one of them pregnant?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: You're asking the wrong question. Not how, why?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: You think it was Ethan.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: It certainly feels like it was Ethan, doesn't it?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: By himself. How?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: We can't account for all of our people. And, more importantly, who's to say they're even our people?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Sayid said there were others.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Sayid said we're not alone.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Semantics.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Sayid's injured. We're not even sure where he went. He's delirious.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm just telling you what the ground is telling me.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: So which way is the ground telling you that they went?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Jack, we don't know what's going on here.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: We know enough.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: We need to prepare. We could be back at the caves in 10 minutes, organize a search party, get wea-
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Which way did they go, Locke?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 NURSE: ...stats are dropping.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: C'mon, c'mon.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 NURSE #2: BP's falling. She's bleeding out.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: No, I've got the artery almost there.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 NURSE #2: She's in arrest.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: 1 milligram epi. Let's get the crash cart over here. Alright, artery's sealed. Close her up.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 NURSE: Defib.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Charge
Lost.Season01.Episode11 NURSE: Charged.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Clear.  Charge.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 NURSE: We're charged.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Clear.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Come on, come on back now, come on. Come on now. Come on back. Come on.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Call it.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK:  Come on, baby, come back. Come back. Come on, baby, come on. Come on now. You can do this. Come on. Come on.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Call it, Jack. It's over, call it.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK:  You call it.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: You let him go alone?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Don't worry. I'll catch up. What's the word from the beach?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Nothing. Nobody has seen him.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: I'm coming with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: I figured you might.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SHANNON:  What are you doing? We need to get our water and get back to the beach...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE:  I heard you're forming a search party. Can I help?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SHANNON: This is a deserted Island. There's no choppers, no Amber Alerts. How exactly are you going to find them?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: By following Ethan's trail. No one can walk through the wilderness without leaving signs, bending blades of grass, breaking twigs, especially with captives in tow. And yes, I could use another hand if you're up for it.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: I'm up for it.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE:  Then let's get moving.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: I could take Vincent, and he could sniff something that belonged to Charlie. And I can help.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 MICHAEL: I said no, man. Hey, Locke. Hey, look, you know, a lot of us don't just want to sit here waiting for news.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Thanks, but we're set. Anyone else will just slow us down.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 MICHAEL: Okay. Maybe I'll just put together another party.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Good idea. We're going north. I suggest you go south.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 MICHAEL:  Come on.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: I never thought I'd see the day, Jack. You barge into my O.R. You work on my patient.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: You didn't have to do this procedure.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: I don't have to do anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Yeah, of course, you don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: I chose to do this procedure, this emergency procedure, because when this girl crashed in the ER, they called me.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: I was right upstairs.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: And you should have stayed upstairs. And how did you find out?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: One of the nurses came to get me.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Who?  Oh, thank god I have you and some anonymous nurse to rescue me.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: She told me that your hands were shaking.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: My hands were not...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: You cut her hepatic artery.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: She was in a car crash, Jack. Her insides were a mess.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: You made a mistake.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: They called me. I...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: I don't care whether they called you. You made a mistake.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Are you lecturing me?! You tell me, if you were upstairs, and I was in a restaurant having lunch, then why did they call me?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: How many drinks did you have at lunch, dad?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Jack. Jack. It's a good thing you were going in a circle. Not much of a search grid, but we never would have found you otherwise.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE:  Did you find anything?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: You should go back to the caves -- Sayid's leg.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: I dressed Sayid's leg. You found me, we can find Charlie and Claire. Now, do we have a trail to follow or not?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Jack, this was my fault.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: I hunted with Ethan. I spent time with him. I never sensed anything -- off. But for everything that I know about hunting, tracking -- whoever he is, he knows more. If we catch up with him, I don't want anything to happen to the only trained physician on the Island. So go back, be the doctor. Let me be the hunter.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Can we go now?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Follow me.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 MICHAEL: I'm trying to help and all the guy can tell me is go south? Like what? I'm going to get in his way or something?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: We're all tweaked, man. Locke's just feeling it like the rest of us.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 MICHAEL: So, what? There's five other guys who would've gone out there with me, putting our necks on the line to find Charlie and Claire. All I'm saying is I'm getting sick of getting treated like a second class citizen around here because Mount Baldy can bag a boar.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: He knows a lot more than how to catch a boar. Mr. Locke is a warrior. He can hunt, he can track stuff, and he's the only who brought knives. So, if it were me, I would listen to him.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 MICHAEL: Well, I don't want you to. You understand?  You stay with Hurley. I may not be a warrior, but I am going south.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: Back home, I'm known as something of a warrior myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: We mark our progress by line of sight. We tie these off so we don't get lost.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: You can lead us back to camp, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: If nothing happens to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Maybe I better take marker detail.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Anything?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Not yet.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: If you can't find the trail...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: I'll pick it up again, alright? We need to rest for a minute to get our clarity back.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: You're going to take a break? It's got to be almost 4 o'clock. When the sun sets there's no way...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: It's 4:25. And, yes, I'm taking a break.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE:  Can I talk to you for a sec?  Would it kill you to give the guy a little space?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: It might.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Stop that.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: That. What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: I didn't believe her -- Claire. I gave her a sedative.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Jack, you can't...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: She told me someone was after her, that she was being attacked, and I -- she just seemed so out of it. I thought that her pregnancy was amping up her stress and I... I didn't believe her.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE:  Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: What is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Look familiar?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: It's Charlie's.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: You think it just came off?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: No. He's leaving us a trail.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: They went this way.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm not so sure. There's another trail here.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: What do mean, another?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: These are footprints. People moved off this way.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Charlie's leaving these for us to follow . They went that way.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Unless Charlie isn't the one leaving them. If Ethan knows that we're behind him, he could be setting up a dummy trail. Take off in one direction, double-back his own footprints.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Wait? Now you're a tracker?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: You're just full of surprises.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: So, we've got two trails. Let's split up, I'll take that one.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: No. We should stay together, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Why? We've got two trails, and, apparently, two trackers.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Be careful.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Who got taken by what?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: Charlie and Claire, they think Ethan took them.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Ethan took them, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Took them why? And who the hell is Ethan?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: I don't know. He wasn't on the list thing, the manifest.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Ever think he might have lied about his name?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: It's stupid to lie about your name.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Alrighty, Tattoo, where do you think Ethan came from?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: Maybe he was already on the Island, before we were.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: You got yourself one hell of an imagination, kid.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: There could be lots of other people on the Island.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: So a tribe of evil natives planted a ringer in the camp to kidnap a pregnant girl and a reject from VH-1 has-beens? Yeah, fiendishly clever. And why am I getting the evening news from a 6 year old?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: I'm 10.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Okay, then it must be true.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: If you don't believe me, ask Sayid. He said we're not alone.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Sayid's back?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Red shirt.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Red shirt. Ever watch "Star Trek"?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Nah, not really.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: The crew guys that would go down to the planet with the main guys, the captain and the guy with the pointy ears, they always wore red shirts. And they always got killed.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Sounds like a piss-poor captain.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: What do you do in the real world, Mr. Locke?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: It's John.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: John.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Why don't you guess?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Well, you're either a taxidermist or a hit man?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE:  I was a regional collection supervisor for a box company.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: A box company?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: They made boxes.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE:  Yeah, right.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Please, slow down.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: You said they went this way.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: I think they went this way. I'm not as good at this as Locke is.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: So where did you pick up the tracking skills, Kate? Was that before or after you were on the run?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: I'm trying to help, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: You know what might help? A little honesty. Just give me something real, anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: My dad was in the army. Ranger Battalion. We were stationed in Fort Lewis, Washington State. We'd go hiking together. One day we spend 8 hours tracking deer. Being in the woods, it was like -- it was like his religion.  That was real. Anything you want to share, Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Oh, thanks for coming in, Jack. Have a seat. 
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: What does it say?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: The truth, that a patient was brought to the ER following a car accident, rushed into surgery with massive internal bleeding -- you joined me, and in spite of our most heroic efforts, the patient succumbed to her injuries.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Looks like you fixed everything but the patient. You had no business being in O.R.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Do you really think I would have walked in there if I couldn't handle it?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: You've done it before.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: That's right, I have, because I am perfectly capable of making those...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: How can you say that after what happened yesterday?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: The problem is not that...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: You were impaired.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: I know my limits.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: I won't sign this.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: You're a part of the team, Jack. I'm not the only one on the hook for this. You called me off. You were the surgeon of record when she died. Look, accidents happen in surgeries all the time, Jack. That's the truth and you know it. But if you contradict this report, if you mention alcohol, well, that's the only fact that's going to matter. They'll strip me of my license.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Yes, they will.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: I know I have been hard on you, but that is how you make a soft metal into steel. That is why you are the most gifted young surgeon in this city. And this, this is a career that is all about the greater good. I've had to sacrifice certain aspects of my relationship with you so that hundreds and thousands of patients will live because of your extraordinary skills.  I know it's a long, a long time coming. What happened yesterday, I promise you, will never happen again. And after all what I've given -- this is not just about my career, Jack. It's my life.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Thank you, son. Thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Well, well, well. I don't know if you Islams got a concept of karma, but I get the sense this Island just served you up a heaping platter of cosmic payback.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAYID: What do you want?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Dr. Do-Right doesn't trust me with his antibiotics so I have to hump it up here everyday just to get my meds.  You know, a less magnanimous man than I might just be thinking he could beat the ever-living-snot out of you right now without fear of reprisal.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAYID: You want to take a shot? Take it. But know that I left this camp out of shame for what I did to you. It was never my intention to return.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Sorry, fresh out of sweet forgiveness. If it wasn't your intention to return, then why did you?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAYID: I was taken prisoner by the French woman.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: The one who's been sending out a distress signal for 16 years? She's alive?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAYID: She was on a science expedition. She said their ship wrecked.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: She alone?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAYID: She said that there are others on this Island.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Her people?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAYID: No. She believed they had all gotten sick. She murdered her entire team.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Right. And these others, who the hell are they?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAYID: I don't know. She's never seen them.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Oh, she's never seen them, but she knows they're there.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAYID: If you believe her.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Do you?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAYID: Maybe. Maybe not. But on my way back I heard something in the jungle surrounding me.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER: Something like what?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAYID: Have you got something to say to me, Sawyer, or are you going to continue asking me questions you know I don't have the answers to?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SAWYER:  Tide's coming up the beach. Plane hull's almost in the water. Kept your signal fire burning.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: Crap.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: Your blacks can't get in.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: Yeah, I know my blacks can't get in.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: My roll.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: Yahoo.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: Need a 4-3. 
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: Dude, would you please roll?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT:  Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: No!
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: Your turn.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: It's okay, I wasn't very good when I first started playing, either.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: I didn't just start playing. I took 17th in a tournament once.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: 17th is not very good.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: No, 17th is very good.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: C'mon double 6's, double 6's.  Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: Aw, you've got to be kidding me,
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: I'm lucky.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: No one is that lucky.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: My dad said I was the luckiest person he ever knew.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: Really?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: Not Michael, Brian. My other dad. Yeah, um. . .  Yes! Yes! C'mon, one more game, double or nothing.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: Can't. I have a meeting.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: A meeting?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: Yeah. A meeting.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: You owe me 20 thousand dollars!
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HURLEY: You'll get it.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: It's been all 15 minutes since we've seen any sign. What are we following?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: My gut.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Great.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: So, Boone, what did you do in the real world?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: I run a business.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: What kind of business?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Uh, it's a wedding thing.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: My mother has this empire. The Martha Stewart of matrimony. I run one of the subsidiaries.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: So who's running it now?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: I guess it doesn't matter, does it?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm sure there are people who can handle it, temporarily. It's going to start raining, in one minute.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: 1 minute?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Give or take a few seconds. You should turn around, Boone, and head back.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: The trail's been cold for a quarter mile, dangerous terrain ahead. If you start now, you'll make it back to camp before dark.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: What about you?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: I can take care of myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: No, I'm not heading back.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: I admire your courage, but...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: I'm not heading back.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE:  Alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: They teach you how to predict the weather in a box company?!
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: I guess we were right.  Where to now?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Jack? Jack, where are you going? Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Didn't you hear her?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: What? Hear, hear who?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode11 ETHAN: If you do not stop following me, I will kill one of them.  Do you understand?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 ETHAN: No more warnings.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 ANDREA:  Dr. Shephard.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Andrea. Andrea, that man that my father is talking to, who is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 ANDREA: That's her husband. He's threatening to sue.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Jack, Jack. Jack, are you okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: How long was I out?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: I don't know, I'm sorry, you slid on the rocks and...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Ethan?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Ethan was here.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: You banged your head, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: No, no. He was here.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: You have to stop. The rain has washed away the trail. Even if he was here -- you've got -- Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: I'm not letting him do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Not letting him?!
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Not again.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: We realized that her blood pressure was continuing to drop precipitously, at which point the patient went into cardiac arrest. Of course, every effort was made to resuscitate her, but the severity of her injuries, the amount of internal bleeding, made that impossible. Now, in my professional opinion, ladies and gentlemen, and that's all I have, by the time I was called in the damage was irreversible.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR: Okay, thanks, Christian. Sorry about this formality.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Of course.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR: Just one final detail -- you were aware of the patient's pregnancy when you went into the procedure?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Absolutely. The patient's husband had informed the attending in the ER. It was, however, extremely early in the pregnancy, so our primary focus had to be on the mother.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR: Okay, then. I think we're done here. The final report will be filed.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: I need to -- revise my statement. I didn't come into the O.R. until well into the procedure.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: I was warned by one of the nurses that my father was operating... under the influence.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Jack. This is not...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: By the time I got there it was clear that my father was not only incapacitated, but that he had also severed the patient's hepatic artery, which, in my professional opinion, caused the crisis which led to her death.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: No.  You've got to cut him down.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Hold on, Charlie. Hold on there.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: I can't reach! Pull him over to me!
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: He's not breathing. C'mon, breathe, Charlie. C'mon, breathe. C'mon. C'mon.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: C'mon, Charlie, c'mon! C'mon, c'mon, Charlie, c'mon!
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Jack, Jack stop, he's not...! Jack, stop, he's not coming...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: It's okay, it's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: No, no.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Jack, Jack! 
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: Stop! Stop!
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: C'mon! C'mon.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: Just breathe, breathe. Breathe deep, breathe deep. You're okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 WALT: Dad!  They brought Charlie back. But he hasn't said anything since he came back.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 MICHAEL:  They find Claire?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK:  Does that hurt? How's your breathing?  Charlie, you've got to talk to me. We're going to back out and look for Claire the moment the sun comes up, and I could really use your help. Anything that you can tell me about what you remember, where you were going. Did you see or hear...?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHARLIE: I didn't see anything, hear anything. I don't remember anything. Claire...
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHARLIE: That's all they wanted.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 JACK: They?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 CHARLIE: All they wanted was Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 SHANNON:  They aren't back yet.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 KATE: I'm sure they just made camp for the night. If there's anyone on this Island that your brother's safe with, it's Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Are we lost?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: No, Boone, we're not lost.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Sorry, it's just... I don't see how you can still be following this trail. I think we should go back.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Don't you feel it?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Feel what?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: It.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Alright, John. I'm going to follow the strips back.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Suit yourself.  Boone, you need this more than I do.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: What is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: Steel.
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: Could that be part of the plane? Part of the wreckage?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 BOONE: What is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode11 LOCKE: That's what we're going to find out.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER:  Ow. Son of a bitch. What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: It's my knee. You practically busted my damn knee.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: You stalking me, now?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Stalking you? I was protecting you.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: From what? Southern perverts?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Yeah, whatever. I can't believe you.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: It's not that bad.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: It's my knee. I'll tell you how bad it is. What the hell you doing out here anyway?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Everyone's been eating a lot. This is the only place the trees aren't picked clean.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Yeah, well, you shouldn't be out here alone. Not after what happened...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: No, I'm fine. I can take care of myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Oh, of course.  I don't need protection. I can take care of myself. Me Kate. Me throw rock.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE:  Shhhh.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: What? You smell blood on the wind?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: You don't hear that?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: I need to soak my sore knee. Come on, Freckles, after all we've been through on this damn Island, don't we deserve something good? What? You going to say no? You some sort of navel-gazing, no-fun, mopey type?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Well, ... it's chilly. Come on, girl, woohoo. It's nice, huh? C'mon, what you got? C'mon, let's go up the rocks. C'mon.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Hey, are you okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Yeah. Yeah, you?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Yeah, I'm going to go check them out.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Check them out for what?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: See what they got on them.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Sawyer!
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Hey, I got myself a wallet.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: You're disgusting.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: He ain't gonna miss it.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Help me get that case.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Oh, I'm disgusting, but you're not?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: It's mine.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER:  Wouldn't happen to have your key on you, would you?  That case ain't yours, is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Well, you wouldn't mind if I just -- take it.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: I don't care.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Not what it looks like.  Something you want to tell me about this little suitcase, Freckles?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Take it.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: Everything is getting washed out to sea. This can't be normal. The tide shifting so suddenly, rising in so short a time.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: There's a lot not normal around here. At the rate this beach is eroding this fuselage is going to be underwater in a matter of days. We need to get all this stuff off the beach before nightfall.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: I just hope that moving up the coast will make a difference.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: It would make a difference if everyone moved inland.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: I think you'll find people slightly wary of entering the jungle after what happened to the pregnant girl. Not to mention whatever that thing is.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Sayid, I need you to take me back to the French woman, Rousseau. Claire's still out there. Now, Rousseau mentioned that there are others on this Island.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: Her mind is gone.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: You heard them yourself.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: I don't know what I heard.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: You said that when you...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: The wind, Jack. It was the wind playing tricks.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Okay, then, what about the papers that you took from her -- the documents, the maps. I mean, isn't there anything here that. . .
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: I'm skilled at mathematics and decryption, but these equations are beyond anything I've ever seen. There are these notes in French accompanying some of the maps and diagrams. If I could translate them I might be able to make sense of it, but. . .
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: Perhaps some things are best left untranslated.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Yeah?  Maybe you should tell him that.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 BOONE: Glad to see you're doing something productive with your time.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: Where have you been?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 BOONE: What do you mean where have I been?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: You and Locke have been leaving before sunrise and coming back after dark for the last 4 days. What are you doing out there? Is he your new boyfriend?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 BOONE: We're looking for Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: I thought there was no trail anymore -- that no one even knew where to look.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 BOONE: Yeah, well, at least I'm doing something. Don't you see the way they look at us around here? They don't take us seriously. We're a joke. I'm trying to contribute something. You're just -- you're useless.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 Mark Hutton: Okay, Ms. Ryan, if you'll just give me some ID, we'll get started on your loan app.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE:  Okay, here you go.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HUTTON: So what brings you to New Mexico?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: My work.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HUTTON: And what line of work is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: I'm a photographer.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HUTTON: What do you photograph?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: I've been commissioned for a coffee-table book. Uh, pictures of old theaters in small towns.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HUTTON: Oh, there's a fantastic one down in Ruidoso. You can't miss it. It's right off the main road.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Well, if I end up using it, I'll have to make sure I give you acknowledgment, Mr. -- Hutton.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HUTTON: Mark.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROBBERS: Everyone down on the ground. Down on the ground, now.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROBBERS: Don't. Don't even think about it. Let's go. Shut up and move over there. Let's go. Move. Who's back there, I see you. All right, big boy, get your ass down there! Get out.  Alright, girlie, get up and get over there! Let's go, move. Stay there, right there! Get down on the floor, bitch!  Are you the manager?! I said, are you the manager?!
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HUTTON: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: Good. Then let's open the money cage now, before people start getting killed.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROBBER #2: Don't look at me, look at the floor.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Gotcha.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Get off of me.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Golly, I hate to bicker about positions, sweetheart. But I think you're the one on top. Maybe you're not here for the case at all.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Ow, woman. If you wanted to play rough, all you had to do was say so. You want to try for it again?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Give it to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: We're quite close to the equator. The sun might be stronger than what you're used to.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: I have a pretty good base.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: There was a matter I was going to ask you about.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: I need a favor. I need your help translating some papers I took from Rousseau.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: Who's Rousseau?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: The French woman -- the distress call we intercepted.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: Did my brother put you up to this?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: Your brother? No. The papers contain equations accompanied by notations in French. If I could understand the notations, then-
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: Sorry, can't do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: You're the only person on this Island who speaks French.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: I barely speak French.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: Please, Shannon, can you at least try?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER:  Son of a bitch!
Lost.Season01.Episode12 Michael:  You're wasting your time, man. If you pick the lock on a Halliburton, I'll put you on my back and fly us to LA.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: You better find yourself a runway, daddy, cuz there ain't a lock I can't pick.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HURLEY:  What's he trying to do?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 MICHAEL: Pick the lock on a Halliburton.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HURLEY:  Good luck.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 MICHAEL: The only way you're going to open that case is with pure force, man. Impact velocity.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 MICHAEL: You've got to hit it with something hard, like a sledgehammer. Or the axe.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 LOCKE: You got it?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 BOONE:  Yeah. Right there. Isn't there any easier way to get there?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 LOCKE: The easiest way isn't always the best. Did anybody see you take it?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 BOONE: No, I don't think so.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 LOCKE: Well, which is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 BOONE: Sorry?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 LOCKE: No? Or, I don't think so?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 BOONE: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 LOCKE: Good. Let's get to work.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: Hello, Charlie.  Oh, that's right, you're not talking much these days. It doesn't mean you get to be rude.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: Everybody else is helping us move the camp up the beach except for you.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: Are you serious?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: Do you think you're the only one on this Island that's got something to be sad about? Baby, I've got sob stories for you, so why don't you grab the other end of this thing and help me. Well?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Come on. Come on, god.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Impact velocity -- physics my ass. Alright.  Son of a... Unbelievable.  Hey, hey, don't even think about it! Hey! Damn it.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Hell, Freckles, I knew you wanted it. I just didn't know how bad.  Whoa-hoa, you're going to have to come up with a new move.  Ow, god, okay, okay.  Okay, this is just silly. Hold on. I've got a proposition for you. You tell me what's inside and I'll give it to you.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Are you serious?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Hell, no way to open the damn thing. At this point all I care about is satisfying my own curiosity.  Whoa, easy, sweetheart, I don't really care what it is. What's burning me up is why it means so much to you. -- Last chance. Alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON:  Give me the key, now. I'm tired of asking nice. Give me the money cage key, now.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HUTTON: You're just going to kill me, anyway, why would I give you-
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON:  You think we're in a conversation, here, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROBBER #2: Everybody be cool! You want to go home?! Don't look at me, look at the floor! Be calm, stay down!
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON:  Listen to me, I am not going to ask you again. I want that key!
Lost.Season01.Episode12 BASEBALL HAT: I can take him.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 BASEBALL HAT: The tall guy, he's not watching us... It's now or never. Keep your head down.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 BASEBALL HAT: Pick it up, pick it up! Shoot him! Shoot him! What's wrong with you, shoot the gun! Turn off the safety!
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: Give me that gun.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 BASEBALL HAT: Other side, turn it off!
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: I don't know how to use a gun!
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROBBER #2: You want to get shot, fat boy, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON:  Okay, little hero...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: No, please don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: Shut up. Let's you and me go talk, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: I don't know how to use a gun? That's classic.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE:  Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: You never said anything about math.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: You worry about the French, I'll take care of the math.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: I can't do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: If you really put your mind to it, I know you can, Shannon. Where did you learn to speak French?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: I knew this guy.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: This guy?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: In France, in Saint Tropez. I kind of lived there for a while.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: Well, they say that is the best way to learn a foreign language.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON:  Alright. Let me see.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK:  So, what is this? What is this for?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SUN: 두통에 쓰이는 약초인데, 그러니까...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: A headache?  Oh, cool, alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE:  Jack? We got a problem.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: We have a problem? Or, you have a problem?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE:  Jack, you're the only one who knows about me.  Before I left the city, the Marshal who was escorting me, he had this silver case. The airline wouldn't let him bring the case on the plane. It was hard enough trying to convince them to let him wear a gun on his ankle. But the case, they made him check it.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: What was in the case?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Some traveling money, some of his personal stuff. And 4 nine millimeters with a few boxes of ammo.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Guns?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Guns.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: So, where is the case now?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Sawyer has it.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Aha.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: He hasn't been able to open it.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Lucky for us.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: He will. Sooner or later.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: So, what do you need me to do?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: I know where the key is. The Marshal, he kept it in his wallet. In his back pocket.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: I buried him, Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: I know. Where?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: So, what else is in the case?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: What else is in the case, Kate?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Nothing.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: That's the truth?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Just the guns.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: If you want my help, we're going to open the case together.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: Why are you smiling?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: Am I?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: You look -- happy.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: Well, I guess I must be then.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: There's no reason to be happy, things are awful.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: They're not that awful.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: We're stranded on an Island. No one's coming for us.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: You don't know that.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: Well, what I do know, is there's something in that jungle that eats people. Just because we haven't heard from it in a couple of weeks doesn't mean it won't get hungry again. And I know there's a person, or people, that are trying to hurt us...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: Charlie. Nobody blames you.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: For what happened to Claire. It's not your fault. You did everything that you could do. And you came very close to dying yourself.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: Maybe I should have died.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: You know what I think, Charlie? You need to ask for help.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: Who's going to help me?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE:  So, why didn't you put him with the others, when you burned the fuselage?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Because I needed to bury him.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: So you ready to do this?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: Hell, yeah, by now their imaginations are running wild.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Don't hold back. He won't talk if the details are off.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: You and your details, Maggie. 
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: Okay, hero.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: No, please don't. I've got...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON:  Shut up.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROBBER #3: Everybody just relax. I said quiet.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: Okay, Mr. Manager, you want to be a hard-ass? Protect a vault that doesn't even belong to you?  Okay? There's going to be consequences.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: He's going to kill me anyway.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: I said... if you don't shut up! You've got 3 seconds to give me that damn key. 1, 2, , 3.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HUTTON: Alright, I'll give it to you.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: Good. Let's go, right around here. Let's go.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Okay, alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Compared to what?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: You want me to...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: No, I'll do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Did you get it?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Key isn't in here.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: It isn't?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: No, but that was real good sleight-of-hand distracting me with the wallet.  Open it. 
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Jack, I...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Don't. Don't. 
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: A des reflets d'argent. La mer des reflets changeants -- the sea of sparkles? No, wait, um, the sea of silver sparkles that change.  It's the same as the last one.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: Are you sure?  But the equation is completely different. It doesn't relate. What you're saying doesn't make any sense.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: Okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: What about this one? It should say something about latitude or longitude, something about the stars...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: Okay, just give me some room, okay? Um, next to the pond, blue, um, blue eternity, blue eternity? No, wait, no, blue infinity.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: Blue infinity?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: Blue infinity. There's something about this that is so familiar.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: You've been telling me what sounds very much like nonsense for the past hour and now it seems to me...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: Okay, a) I told you that my French sucks, and b) this isn't my nonsense, okay? Did you ever think that after 16 years on Mystery Frickin' Island your friend might not be quite adjusted?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID:  This was a mistake.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: Yeah, haven't you heard? I'm completely useless.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Doctor? What can I do you for?  Figured she'd get you to do her dirty work for her. So what? Are we going to wrestle for it?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: No, you're going to give it to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Am I?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: I'm just going to give it to you?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Why would I want to do that?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Cephalexin.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Yeah, go on?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: That's the antibiotic I've been giving you for the knife wound in your arm. You're right in the middle of the treatment cycle now, if I keep giving you the pills you're going to be as right as rain. But I'm going to stop giving you the pills. And for 2 days you're going to think you're all good, then it's going to start to itch. The day after that the fever's going to come and you're going to start seeing red lines running up and down your arm. A day or two after that you'll beg me to take the case, just to cut off your arm.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: That's a nice story, Jack. And, even if it were true, I don't think you could do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: You're wrong.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: Did she tell you what's inside?  Yeah, me neither.  Hope you got yourself some jaws-of-life back in cave-town, that's what it's going to take to pop this bitch.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: I'll figure something out.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAWYER: I know you think you're doing her a favor. But however she talked you into doing this, she lied, brother.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: We're going to do this together.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Because that's what I said we'd do.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: What the hell you waiting for? Open the damn thing.  Well, now we're talking. Don't move.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Please, don't. I can't...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: Shut up.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HUTTON: I let you in, now please, let the girl go.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: Let the girl go? Man, you have no idea, do you? The girl is the one who set you up. The girl picked this bank, picked this vault. This whole thing is the girl's idea. 
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON:  Easy, Maggie -- just cleaning up after myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: You shoot, I shoot.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HUTTON: Please, what's...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: I said, no one gets hurt.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: I know you're cold, baby. But you're not that cold.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: You shot me, stupid bit...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: Shut up, Jason.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROBBER #2: I told you not to trust her.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE:  I need the key to safety deposit box 815, now.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HUTTON: Who are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: The key to the box, now.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 HUTTON: You need 2 keys. The bank's, and...  If you had the customer key, why would you need...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: I'm not on the signatory card.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JASON: You put me up to this to get into a safe deposit box? I swear to god, you better kill me, Maggie. Because if you don't...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: My name's not Maggie.  Now, go.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Anything you want to tell me?  Alright then. 
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Is this it? Is this what you wanted?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: What is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: It's nothing.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: What is it, Kate?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: You wouldn't understand.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: I want the truth, just this once. What is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: It belonged to the man I loved.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: The truth.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: It belonged to the man I loved.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 JACK: Stop lying and tell me the truth!
Lost.Season01.Episode12 KATE: I'm not! It belonged to the man I killed!
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: Your husband was in the tail section of the plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: Yes, he was. But he'll be back.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: You think he's still alive?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: I know he is.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: How?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: I just do. It's a fine line between denial and faith. It's much better on my side.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 CHARLIE: Help me.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 ROSE: Baby, I'm not the one that can help you... Heavenly Father, we thank you. We thank you for bringing us together tonight, and we ask that you show Charlie the path...
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: The guy from Saint Tropez, he had this kid, a real snot, who hated me. His name was Laurent. He watched this movie over and over and over again, everyday, all day, the way kids do, 900 times. It was the cartoon about fish, you know, one of the computer ones?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: Why are you telling me this?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON: Because the movie was dubbed in French. And at the end there was this song. Those notations, they're song lyrics. And your French woman, she's just like Laurent, because she wrote them over and over and over again.
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SAYID: What's the song?
Lost.Season01.Episode12 SHANNON:  La mer. Qu'on voit danser le long des golfes clairs. A des reflets d'argent. La mer. Des reflets changeants. Sous la pluie. La mer. Qu'on voit danser le long des golfes clairs...
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: I brought you a present for helping me with the translations. I didn't have a chance to get it gift-wrapped, so -- . I found these in the wreckage and I have no use for them personally.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: They are actually my size. Well, half a size off, but, I swear this place is actually making my feel swell.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: Another mysterious force of the Island revealed.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY:  Yo, Boone. Question for you, dude.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: You and Locke are going out hunting boar everyday, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What about it?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: That's cool, except, how come you're not coming back with any? We haven't had fresh pork on a plate in about a week, dude.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: It's not like they're domesticated animals.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: Maybe you guys aren't trying hard enough?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: We're hunting, alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: I hope so, because people need food, man -- solid food. This isn't a game, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I can't believe you ran down that last ball. And then you hit it for a winner.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 NICOLE: Lucky shot.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Yeah, I wish it was luck.  Is that my phone?  Yeah, hello.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON:  Boone, it's me.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Shannon?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Yeah...
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What's the matter?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Um, things aren't so good.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Where are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON:  Get out of here! Get the hell away from me!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Shannon? Shannon?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Just stay out of here! Get the hell away from me!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Shannon, what's going on?  Alright, Shannon, just hang on, just tell me where you are. I'll come get you.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Sydney.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Sydney?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Australia.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Stay away from my sister.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: For a moment you seemed to be giving me an order.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: It's just a friendly suggestion.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: A suggestion?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Yes, and if I were you I'd listen.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: What if I don't?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE:  Boone! Found some fresh tracks down by the stream.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE:  See you later.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: You know where to find me.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: You need to put aside your differences with Sayid.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: He's hitting on Shannon.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE:  He's very competent. We don't want to make an enemy of him. We're going to want him on our side.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: John, people are talking about what we're doing out here every day, especially since we never come back with anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: You mean boar.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Plenty of fruit and fish to go around. What we're doing here is far more important.  Right now, this is our priority.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: So, Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: So, Hurley?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: Something kind of important I'd want to ask you about. Um, anything I tell you is doctor-patient confidential, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: The thing is -- I haven't been feeling so great.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: What's the matter?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: Well, it's kind of like, uh, my stomach. I've been having some, um, major digestive issues.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: What have you been eating?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: You know, the usual - bananas, papayas, mangoes, guava, passion fruit, coconut. Some of those weird star fruits from up on the hill. Someone said they might be good for digestion. Let me tell you, they lied.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Well, it might help if you had a little bit more protein in your diet.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude, what can I do? There's no boar. No boar, no protein.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: You can eat fish. Jin's been catching a lot of them.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: No way, man. That guy has it in for me.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK:  Oh, come on, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: I'm not kidding. He offered me something to eat, like right after we, you know, got here, um, the thing with the spikes?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Sea urchin.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: Yeah. And when I turned him down it's like I soiled his family honor or something. He hasn't looked me in the eye since. The guy holds a serious grudge.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK:  You're not eating those, are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude, these aren't for eating. Excuse me.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: I can see you there, you know.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK:  I wasn't hiding, just didn't want to disrupt you from doing whatever it is you're doing.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: It's not like it's a secret.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Hard to tell with you sometimes.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Huh, gross little, grayish-yellow things.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: Passion fruit seeds.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: What are they for?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: I'll show you. If you want to see?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: Follow me.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Please tell me you found a coffee bar.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: Not quite.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: When did you do all this?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: I didn't. It was all Sun. I just wandered into this place the other day when I was out picking fruit.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK:  This is is beautiful. It's great. 
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: She planted some herbs and some low growing stuff here. And then she started a grove over there.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Smart. With the boar running out we're going to need as much food as we can possibly get.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: Maybe it's not running out.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: What do you mean?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: Maybe Locke's just decided not to catch it for us anymore.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Why would he do that?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: A lot of mouths to feed. If the boar's thinning out then why should he feed everyone else at his own expense?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: That glass isn't breaking and the door's sealed shut. I think it's cement. What is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Hmmm?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: The stuff in the bowl - what is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: It's for later.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: So, not to be too difficult, but we've been coming here for two days just staring at this thing. I'm not really sure what we're supposed to be doing.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Ludovico Buonarrati, Michelangelo's father. He was a wealthy man. He had no understanding of the divinity in his son, so he beat him. No child of his was going to use his hands for a living. So, Michelangelo learned not to use his hands. Years later a visiting prince came into Michelangelo's studio and found the master staring at a single 18 foot block of marble. Then he knew that the rumors were true -- that Michelangelo had come in everyday for the last four months, stared at the marble, and gone home for his supper. So the prince asked the obvious -- what are you doing? And Michelangelo turned around and looked at him, and whispered, sto lavorando, I'm working. Three years later that block of marble was the statue of David.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: We're not going to stare at this for 4 months, are we? How are we going to open it?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Well, that's what we have to figure out. That's why we're sitting here. I mean, how do you open a hatch that has no handle, no latch, no discernible way of opening it?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: Yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I'm looking for Shannon.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: Who are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I'm her brother.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Boone?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: 15 hours. I just spent 15 hours on a plane -- happy to see you, glad you're here -- something like that might work.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Listen, this really isn't the best time. Bryan and I were just on our way out to meet some friends. Why don't you give me a call tomorrow?  Please?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Okay. Enjoy your friends. 
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY:  Jin!  Yo, Jin! Alto. Listen, I know you don't like me because of the sea urchin thing. But that's okay because I'm not asking for any favors. Just let me know where you get the fish. Fish  Just point me in the right direction. I'll take care of my own business with my own tools. 
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JIN: 난 아마추어랑 안 놀아요. 그러니까 저리 가세요. (I have no time for amateurs. Just stay out of my way.)
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: You just said something mean, didn't you?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: You know, we're going to have to tell them.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Tell them what?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What we found. You know, they're not going to keep believing that we're coming out here hunting. We never go back...
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: They're not ready. They won't understand it.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I don't think I understand it.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: That's the problem.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Look, at least I've got to tell Shannon.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What do mean, why? Because she's my sister.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Why do you care about her so much?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: You don't know her, man. She's smart, she's special in a lot of ways.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Fair enough.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: She's been asking me about this. I can't keep lying to her.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: You mean you can't keep lying to her, or you can't stand the way she makes you feel because you're lying to her?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Both. Whatever. Look, she can keep a secret.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: You're sure?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Yes, I'm sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: No, I mean, are you sure you want to do this?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I've got to get her off my back. She keeps asking me about this, she keeps asking me about you, about the whole thing.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: You're sure you've thought through the ramifications?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: So be it.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Locke, what is this? Do you hear me? Untie me right now.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Or what?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I swear I won't tell anyone about the hatch thing, okay? I promise.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: I'm doing this, Boone, because it's time for you to let go of some things. Because it's what's best for you. And, I promise, you're going to thank me for this later.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Hey, I don't think this is best for me  What is that?!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: An untreated wound, out here, is going to get infected.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: You're not going to just leave me here!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Whether you stay is up to you. The camp is 4 miles due west.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Which way is west?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: You'll be able to cut yourself free once you have the proper motivation.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Locke!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Help, help!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 MALCOLM: I'm sorry, Mr. Carlyle, but I'm afraid I can't help you. Unfortunately, sir, we'll need a little more to go on.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I don't understand this, I'm reporting a crime.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAWYER:  I'm sitting in this... little bar, minding my own business. And this guy...
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Look, this is a cycle with her, okay. My sister just happens to be attracted to the wrong kind of guy.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAWYER:  I just gave it back to him.  Hey, yo, croc hunter, how come nobody wants to hear my side of the story, huh?! Just what kind of...
Lost.Season01.Episode13 MALCOLM: Now, if that were her mate, see, then I could help you. Let's finish taking down the rest of your information. You were saying she's your sister, then why is her name Rutherford, and yours Carlyle? Is she married?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: She was married. She's not married anymore, and that has nothing to do with this.  Rutherford is her father's name. Our parents got married when I was 10, she was 8.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 MALCOLM: So she's your step-sister?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: That's right.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 MALCOLM: No blood relation.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Maybe you've heard of my mother, Sabrina Carlyle? She owns the largest wedding business in the United States. I'm the COO of the wedding clothing subsidiary.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 MALCOLM: Would you like to buy my wife's wedding dress? Cost $2000 new. It's only been worn once.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I just want someone to go pay this guy a visit, that's all.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 MALCOLM: Mr. Carlyle, in the absence of any physical evidence or a direct complaint from, uh...
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Shannon.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 MALCOLM: Shannon. We can't just go barging into people's apartments. Sadly, we're the police, not the dating police.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Bryan, we need to talk.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: Yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I'm not going to waste your time, and I'm not going to waste mine. I want you to break up with my sister.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I want you to end it. Today. Right now.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: Oh, bugger off, mate.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What you don't understand, Bryan, is that you'll be the third guy I've paid to leave. Go to her house when she's not there, pack your stuff, and never have contact with her again. Understood?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: So you flew all the way over here to bribe me.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I'm going to give you 25,000 US dollars.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: I love her.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: How much?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: My love for her -- is worth closer to 50,000.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: I can't believe we've been here for over 3 weeks. I was on my way to Bali. I travel a lot. I was looking forward to exploring the Island. Somehow I ended up on a flight to LA, instead. Guess that falls under the category -- be careful what you wish for.  You understood me. You did, didn't you, you just understood what I said? You speak English?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SUN: Please, don't tell anyone.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: Damn it!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JIN:  이거, 내 고기니까 먹지 마. (Don’t eat my fish!)
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: You know what? Fine. You win, okay? You happy now? Keep your damn fish, I'm out of here.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JIN:  무슨 일이에요? (What did you do?)
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: I stepped in a friggin' urchin! Ow, you understand me?!  Do you understand infection, gangrene, amputation?! 
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: Ow, aw, ow! You've got to do something for me.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JIN: 이걸 빼야 되겠네. 촉수를 빼야 돼요. (Just pull out the spines -- pull
them out.)
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: You're going to have to pee on my foot, man. It'll stop the venom. I saw it on TV.  Ow, arrgh, no just pee on it man. 
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JIN: (No -- you idiot -- that isn’t going to do anything! That’s for jellyfish stings!)
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: You need to pee, pee on it. Pee on my foot. I'll lose my foot if you don't. Just pee! Pee on it! Pee on- 
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Hi.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: I didn't hear you.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Sorry. Sneakier than I give myself credit for.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: What are you doing out here?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: We were hunting. Boone thought I should take the afternoon off.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: Boone -- is hunting?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: The boy's eager to learn.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: You think he'll catch anything?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Nope. What are you doing out here, Sayid?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: Orienteering. I'm trying to make something of Rousseau's maps, but...
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: There's nothing to make.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: Exactly.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Well, you made a compass. I haven't seen one of those since I was a Webelos.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: What's a Webelos?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: It's half way between a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: And what does a Webelos do?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Gets badges, mostly. Ties knots, identifies birds. I wasn't the most popular kid. I'll leave you to it.  Maybe this will help your cause.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: Don't you need this?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Not anymore.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Somebody help me!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE:  Who's that?!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Boone!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE:  Shannon! I'm tied up!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: What?!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE:  Can you get over here?!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: I'm tied up, too!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON:  Boone!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Hold on Shannon, I'm coming!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Boone! It's getting closer! Somebody help me! Boone!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Please, help!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Boone!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Boone, help me! Hurry, please!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I'm trying.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Please hurry.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Go. Come on.  In here, in here.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: Let me ask you something -- which way do you think North is?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Sorry?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: North? Which way is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Uh, okay.  The sun's going to set over there, so that makes that West.  That'd be North. Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: Correct. That's where North should be.  Yet that is North.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: I'm not...
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: A minor magnetic anomaly might explain a variance of 2 or 3 degrees, but not this.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: What are you saying?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: I'm saying this compass is obviously defective.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK:  Where'd you get it?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: Locke gave it to me this afternoon.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Locke? Where'd you see Locke?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SAYID: About a mile East of here, walking through the jungle. At least I think it's East.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: What did you do to him?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What did I do to who?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Locke. What did you do to that psycho to piss him off?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I didn't do anything to him.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: What? He just did it because he was bored? Look, I know you guys are...
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Let's go back to camp.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: You were supposed to come later.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Do you have any bags? Anything you want to take?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: You should go back.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: No, Shannon. We're getting out of this country. Is there anything you want to bring with you? What's the matter with you?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: Aw, look at this.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE:  Let's go, please. C'mon. We can go.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: Hey, mate, you don't get this yet, do you -- what's what?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: You set me up. This whole thing was a set up.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: She's just getting what she's owed.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What'd you say?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: She told me your mum screwed Shannon over after her daddy died, kept all her father's money for herself. A sweet mum you got there.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE:  This isn't the first time, is it? Oh, you've done this before, you little bitch.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BRYAN: That's enough.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Don't touch me you low life piece of-
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Bryan, get off of him! Get off of him! Get off!!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Any ships?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Not yet. But I'm -- patient.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Mind if I join you? It's been awhile since you and I talked, John.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Well, you're a busy man.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: So are you. Where's Boone?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: I haven't seen him today.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Yeah? You two have been attached at the hip all week.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Well, let me just check my hip... Nope, no Boone.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: How's the boar hunting going?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Between you and me?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Always.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: I'm afraid they're beginning to migrate outside our valley. They're smart animals, and smart animals adapt quickly when a new predator is introduced into their environment.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: You mean us?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: The most dangerous predator of all.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: Does anybody else know?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SUN: Only Michael.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: But not your husband?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SUN: Please, I...
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: Don't worry. I can keep a secret.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SUN: I took English lessons in Korea. He doesn't know -- it's complicated.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: So why don't you tell him now?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SUN: I can't.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SUN: Because I love him.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: I don't...
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SUN: Have you never lied to a man you've loved?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: You sure you don't speak English? Cuz there's a rumor that you do. -- Your wife's hot.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: Oh, I get it, this is some kind of payback because I wouldn't eat the urchin the other time? I eat this you give me a fish, right? Okay, fine. Over the lips and past the gums, yada yada, oh god.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 CHARLIE:  Cheers.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: You need a hand?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 CHARLIE: Yeah, yeah, I'd love one.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Haven't seen you around the caves lately.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 CHARLIE: I needed a change of scenery.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: How are you doing, Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 CHARLIE: How am I doing? With week 2 of heroin withdrawal? Or how am I doing with Claire being abducted by the freak who tried to kill me?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: I gave you the aspirin for the heroin withdrawal.  What do you think his story is?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 CHARLIE: Who? Locke? The guy's a freak of nature. Highly disturbed. Chances are he probably killed all his mates at the post office the day his mum forgot to put a cookie in his lunch tin. That was my first impression, anyway. And then he saved my life.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: So you trust him?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 CHARLIE: Trust him? No offense, mate, but if there's one person on this Island I would put my absolute faith in to save us all it would be John Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 WALT: C'mon, you want the ball? Go get the ball. Go get the ball. Good boy.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY:  Dude, did you find your own bag? That's awesome, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 MICHAEL: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 WALT: Come on, Vincent, over here.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: Be nice to get to use your own toothbrush again.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 MICHAEL: Got some papaya there, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY: Yeah. Yippee.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 MICHAEL:  Hey, you mind if I, uh...?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 HURLEY:  Knock yourself out. You want to wish something on your worst enemy? Hope they step on a sea urchin.  Oh hey, thanks. Dude, has this thing already been cleaned? Are you kidding me?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SUN: 밥 먹었어요?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JIN: 아니, 아직 안 먹었어. 손 씻어야 겠어. 손이 더러워졌어.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK:  They look happy.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: Happy?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Put out your hand.  You'll like it, I swear.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: Gross little grayish-yellow thingies?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: Oh, no, no, no, these are slimy little bluish-black thingies.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 KATE: Guava seeds.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 JACK: What's a garden without guava?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Are you sure we're going in the right direction?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: If you don't want to follow me, don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: I wouldn't have to follow you if you weren't best friends with the nut case who brought us out here. You and Locke weren't hunting, were you? You were doing something else.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Haven't we been over this before?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: You're a horrible liar, Boone.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: We weren't doing anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Why are you keeping secrets for this guy?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Do you know who this guy is? He's the only one here that has a clue to what's going on.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: What is that supposed to mean?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: It means he's smart.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: He tied us up, Boone. Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: We found something.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: While we were out looking for Claire we found this -- this piece of metal buried in the jungle. We've been excavating it. That's what we've been doing.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: A piece of metal?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: A hatch, buried in the dirt.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Like a door?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Yes, Shannon, that's what a hatch is.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Where does it go?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I don't know. But I told him I wanted to tell you, and that's when he did this.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: C'mon.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: No, Shannon!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Shannon! Shannon!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What do you want?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Bryan took the money. He's gone.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: So the player got played. It's poetic, don't you think?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: I knew you'd bring the money. I knew you would.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: You're drunk.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: You want to know why?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I guess it doesn't matter, does it? Because you're going to tell me anyway.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Because you're in love with me.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: You brought the money because you're in love with me.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: You show up here plastered...
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: You've always been in love with me.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: You've always been a self-centered little bitch, but now you're delusional.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: I've always known it.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: You're sick.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON:  No.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Stop.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: It's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Boone?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: When we get back to LA  you should just tell your mom that you rescued me -- again, just like you always do. And then we'll just go back.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: To what?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: To what it was.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Like it's all up to you.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 SHANNON: Get dressed.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Shannon!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: No...  Shannon? Shannon? Shan?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE:  It killed her!
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: You made it back.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: That thing killed my sister. It's your fault. You drug her out there.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Your sister?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: Don't play dumb with me.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Calm down.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: She died in my arms.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Why is there no blood on you?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What the hell just happened to me out there?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: I don't know. I don't know, you tell me.  But your sister, Shannon... 
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: She was dead.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Is that what it made you see?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: What made me see? That stuff you put on my head -- you drugged me.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: I gave you an experience that I believe was vital to your survival on this Island.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: It wasn't real?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: It was only as real as you made it.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I saw her -- I saw her die.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: How did you feel? When she died?
Lost.Season01.Episode13 BOONE: I felt -- I felt -- I felt relieved. I felt relieved.
Lost.Season01.Episode13 LOCKE: Yes. Time to let go.  Follow me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Walt! Walt! Walt! Walt!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE:  Hey, Michael, you seen Claire's bags?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: You seen my son?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: You seen her bags?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Claire's?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: Her luggage. It's not been brought back here. No one seems to know what's happened to it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Uh, sorry man, I don't know. I'm just looking for Walt.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: Oh, got it. Sorry, I've not seen him.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Hey, Jack, you see my boy when you were out there?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 JACK: No, he was at the caves.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Yeah, he took his dog for a walk. I told him to stay close, as usual. You listened to your old man when you were 10, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 JACK: Uh, yeah, yeah, I listened. Maybe a little too well.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 HURLEY:  Yo, dudes. Got a new tourney lined up. We're playing for the last of the deodorant sticks. You dogs up for some golf?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I have to go find my kid. Hey, if Walt shows up, you tell him I said stay right here until I get back.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 JACK: You got it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL:  Walt! Walt!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 HURLEY: He seems to hate it, doesn't he?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 HURLEY: Being a dad.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 JACK: No, it's just a lot of hard work.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 HURLEY: No. He hates it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Walt!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: This is the one. This is definitely my baby's crib.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Uh-huh, beautiful. It'll look great in the alley we'll be living in. This is 3 months rent.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What? It's not 3 -- look, don't you want the best for this kid?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I know you're excited, but, Michael, we can't afford this.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Our baby in this crib? C'mon, that's a happy kid. Hey, I talked to Andy, he said he could throw some work my way.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Construction? What about your art?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: No, no, no, no. I'm not giving it up. I'm just going to take a break until you finish law school, pass the bar, get hired by some fancy-ass high paying law firm...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Somebody's got it all figured out.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Yeah, I'll get back to painting eventually. Meanwhile, you can support me and Walt in a manner to which we'll soon become accustomed.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Walt, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I'd like to do that, you know, name him after my dad.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Walter. Walter Lloyd.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Lloyd? Oh, all right. That's why you won't marry me. It's not that you think marriage is too prosaic, you just want him to have your last name.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Hey, you want me to agree to Walter, or what?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Man, I suck.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: You can do better than that.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BOONE: You might want to take it easy on him.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE:  See this knot, Walt? I want you to aim for it, right here. Focus on it, alright? Picture it in your mind's eye. You know what that is, right? The mind's eye?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Like a picture in your head or...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: That's right. Now do it again. But see it. See it before you do it. Visualize the path. See it. See it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BOONE: Whoa.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Yes!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: I knew you had it in you, Walt.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: It was weird. I actually saw it, in my mind or something, like it was real.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: Who's to say it wasn't? 
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL:  Hey! What the hell is going on?  Give me that.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: But, I was...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Take Vincent and go back to camp.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: But, Mr. Locke was...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Now, little man.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL:  You gave my boy a knife?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: You should have seen what...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Hey, don't tell me what I should have seen, man! If we were back home, I'd call the police on your ass! Encouraging a kid to sneak away from his parent?! Giving him a knife like this?!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: Walt knows his own mind.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL:  Hey, don't talk about my son like you know him!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: You really need to calm down.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: You keep playing my son against me, and I'm going to have a-
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BOONE: The man said calm down.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What are you his attack dog?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: Easy, easy, easy. You're the one that was waving the knife around. He was just trying to make sure you didn't hurt someone. Michael, I know it's been difficult to bond with your son. You know why he's formed an attachment to me? Because I treat him like an adult. You still treat him like a boy.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: He's 10 years old.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: He's been through more than most people in their entire lifetimes. Maybe you haven't spent enough time with him to see it, but he's different.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What did you say?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: And we're not back home, Michael. As long as we're here, I think Walt should be allowed to realize his potential.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Stay away from my son. And me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: You're not taking him. You're not taking my son. You can go if you want to, but Walt stays with me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I'm trying to have a discussion with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: No you're not. You're talking about going to Amsterdam, just you and him. How is that a discussion?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: It's an offer, Michael. And that's where the job is.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: You said you were happy. What about the legal clinic being a good fit? You said that...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: This is a huge opportunity. You know I've always wanted to do international law.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Am I supposed to be happy for you over here? For your huge opportunity?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: We've talked about taking some time apart.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Look, babe, I thought that was -- hey, we said a lot of things. You said you wanted to live on a boat.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I still love you. You know, I do, but, Michael, we've been through so much in such a short time. Things...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Babe, we've got problems, right, that's what people have. You want to go to counseling? I'm down with that, let's go, alright?  Oh, man, you already took it, didn't you -- the job?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Yeah, I did. You haven't worked in months.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Construction slows in the winter -- I already told you that.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I can provide for him. I'll give him everything he needs.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Except for his dad. He's not going with you, so, no!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: You really want to argue with me about this?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Hell yes! There are laws against this kind of thing.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: We're not married, Michael. I'm his mother and I'm steadily employed. Who do you think court's going to side with? -- This is not goodbye forever. I just -- I need some time.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUN: Are you alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: No, I'm okay. Thanks. I just don't know how to talk him. How to get him to --, you know, understand I'm on his side. Locke says I should stop treating him like a child. I missed his whole childhood, so -- this can't happen.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUN: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: He can't grow up here. He can't grow up in this place.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAYID: Once I realized these equations were coordinates, latitude and longitude, I assumed the French woman was trying to determine the location of the Island. But it was incomplete, the notations fragmented.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SHANNON: Except for the fish song.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAYID: MmHmm.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 JACK: The what?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAYID: But when I laid the pages down like this  I realized it wasn't showing the location of the Island. I think it's a location on the Island. Specifically, here.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 JACK: So where are we in relation to the triangle?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAYID: Well, the map is hardly in scale, so I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 JACK: We're not even sure it's a map of this Island, are we?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAYID: We're not, no. But this may be the transmitter sending out the distress call. And its power source.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL:  What are we talking about doing now? Looking for another excuse to get chased down and killed by whatever lives in the jungle? Guys, we can't keep doing this. Building water filtration systems? Playing golf? Making a sweet little home here? We need to get off this Island.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SHANNON: You think any of us wants to be here?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: No, but I don't think anyone wants to get off as much as I do right now.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 JACK: So, are you suggesting something?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Yeah, we build a raft.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAYID: A raft?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Look, don't say it like that, man. We need a little optimism here, okay? And we've got to do something because, let's be honest, no one's coming. Those seats we took off the fuselage, they float. And we've got an axe, and a whole bunch of trees, bamboo. We can do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAYID: The chances of surviving the rough waters? The odds of finding a shipping lane?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SHANNON: And I get really sea-sick.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: You know what? Great. Stay here. Grow old. Good luck to you, but I'm doing this. My son and I are leaving. Anybody that wants to help us build, God bless you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT:  Conardo sepe que machio une oso polar. (This seems to make no sense the way Walt said it, except for Polar Bear.)
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL:  Hey, Walt. Hey, c'mon, I need your help with something.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: I'm doing stuff.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: You're reading a comic book in Spanish and you don't read Spanish, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: I like the pictures.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: You like the art, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: I guess so.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: You know, when I was your age, I don't know, maybe a little older, I used to trace comic books. I taught myself about perspective. You know what that is -- perspective?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Hey!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I said I need your help. Let's go.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Why do I have to come?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Because I've seen what happens when I don't keep an eye on you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Let me talk to him.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: He's 21 months old. He doesn't use the phone.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I'll do all the talking. I just want him to hear my voice. I miss him.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I know. Let me call you back, okay? This isn't a good time.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: We've got to go.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Shh. It's Michael.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Who's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Let's talk tomorrow, okay? I'll call you from work.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What the hell is going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Michael, listen, I've been seeing someone.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What? Who?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Does it make any difference?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Who is it?!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Brian Porter.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: The guy who hired you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: It wasn't like that before.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: So when you said you needed time to think about us, you were just lying?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: No! I did, and I realized...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: No. I'm coming to Amsterdam.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Michael don't. It's over between us.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I'm not coming for you! I'm coming for Walt! I'm getting my son back!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MAN:  Call an ambulance!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 KATE: Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: Hey. These are Claire's things. Who brought them here?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 KATE: I did. Why? What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: I can't find it. I don't know where it is.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: Claire's diary. She kept her diary in this side pocket. I know because I saw her put it in there. Someone's taken it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: What are we looking for again?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Any long piece of metal or plastic tubing. Anything that looks like it would work as a frame.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: A frame for what?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: You'll see soon enough. Hey, separate the cushions, the plastic, the tarp. Put everything you find in different piles so we can take stock.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Am I being punished?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What? You think working with your old man is punishment? No, man, this us taking control of our destiny.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Feels like punishment.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 KATE: Sawyer? Hey, Sawyer?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: You know, I could just go inside and...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAWYER:  Trick or treat. What are you two selling today?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: Where's Claire's diary? Someone took it from her bag.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAWYER: Oh, I get it, something goes missing and right away you figure it's got to be me that took it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 KATE: Do you have the diary or not?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAWYER:  You mean this one?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: Give it to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAWYER: Now, I'm not sure that's the best idea. Maybe Missy Claire don't want you reading it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: I wasn't going to read it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAWYER: You're not curious what she wrote about you?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: You bastard. Did you read it?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAWYER: Good literature's kinda scarce around here.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: He read it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 KATE: Just give it to us.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAWYER: "Dear Diary, I'm getting really freaked out by that has-been pop star. I think he's stalking me."
Lost.Season01.Episode14 KATE: Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAWYER: "Diary, the little limey runt just won't let up."
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: You hit like a ponce.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAWYER:  Oh, yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 KATE: Alright, enough.  You didn't really read it, did you?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAWYER: I just hadn't gotten around to it yet.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Um, I'm going to get some water.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Yeah, okay. Would you bring me some? Please?  Please and thank you. We've got to work on that.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SHANNON: Boone. Hi. So are you guys just going to keep coming back without any food?  Hey, I'm serious.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BOONE: Uh-huh.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SHANNON: What's going on with you, Boone? Could you be acting any weirder?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BOONE: Shannon, you've been a functioning bulimic since junior high. I thought you'd be excited about dropping a size or two.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SHANNON: Well, since you're not having any luck with hunting maybe you should help Michael. He's building a raft. I was thinking I would help him out, maybe finally get the hell out of here. Why don't you help me?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BOONE: No, thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: Your father doesn't want us spending time together.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: He's not the boss of me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: But he's your father. And he cares about you. And you need to show him respect. I'm serious, Walt. You're not to come to me anymore.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL:  Damn it! What is wrong with you?!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: I was just coming to see you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I told you to stay away from my son!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: He didn't. I was just gonna...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Walt, I don't want to hear from you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: I was just giving him this pencil to give to you. I thought you could use it. Consider it a peace offering.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL:  If I catch you with my son again, I'll kill you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: You're a jerk.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What'd you say to me?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Mr. Locke didn't do anything wrong. He's my friend.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: He's not your friend anymore. I'm looking out for you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: You don't care about me. You never cared about me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: You only showed up after my Mom died. Where were you when I was growing up, huh? Nowhere.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Listen, Walt, it's -- it's complicated.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: I don't even care. You're not my father.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: You want to hate me? You want to punish me for something I can't change, fine? But you will listen to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Now, you get over there, and you stay there. Now!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 NURSE:  Hm, that's really wonderful.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Oh, thanks. For my son. He's going to be 2 next week.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 NURSE: Yeah? I didn't know you had a kid.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, um, he lives in Amsterdam with his mom.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 NURSE: Ever go to visit him?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: No. No, not yet. I had a little, you know, run in with a car. I never know what to write.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 NURSE: How about a joke?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I don't know. What kind of joke?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 NURSE: How about what's black, white, and red all over?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Yeah, a newspaper, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 NURSE: A penguin with a sunburn.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL:  That's really dumb.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 NURSE: Trust me, mother of 4 talking here. He'll get a kick out it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN:  Hello, Michael.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Susan.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I finally called Andy when I hadn't heard from you in over two months. I had to hear about your accident from him. You should have called me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Yeah, well, considering how our last conversation went...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I'm so sorry about that.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Hey, did you bring Walt?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: No. No, he's at home.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Oh, with Brian. So what are you doing here anyway?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I came to see you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: So I look pretty good, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Not that bad. -- Nurses say you're expected to make a full recovery.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Yeah, after a year of physical therapy. A year!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I'm covering all your medical costs.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I've already spoken to the hospital administrator and all your bills are coming directly to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What is this about?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Brian and I are getting married.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: How nice for...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: No, you don't have to say anything, just listen. We're moving to Italy at the end of the month. Brian's taking over the firm's Rome offices.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Sounds like Brian's on a roll.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: And he wants to adopt Walt. I know this is hard, but just think about it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: You're kidding me, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Consider what's best for Walt. You can keep holding on if you want, but ask yourself why you're doing that. Is it really for him? Or is it for you?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 HURLEY: Uh, dude? Your kid's gone.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 HURLEY: He just grabbed the dog and took off.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I know where he's gone.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Locke, where the hell is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I'm not in the mood for your games, man. Where's Walt?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: Walt's not here, Michael.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Don't lie to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BOONE: Hey, man, he's not here. Look around.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I'm not talking to you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: I told him this morning that he couldn't be around me anymore, trying to respect your wishes.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Well, if he's not...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: Let's go find your boy.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: Thanks. You really didn't have to help, you know. I could've managed. I've had my share of manly encounters.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 KATE: I just thought you could use the company. You okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: Yeah. It's weird. I barely knew her -- barely know her -- Claire. She's been missing over a week and everyday she's gone it feels like bits of me are crumbling or something.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 KATE: I think it's right that you should keep her stuff safe, until she gets back.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: C'mon, Vincent.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT:  Vincent, cut it out! Cut it out, Vincent! What's wrong?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Vincent!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Vincent! Vincent!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN:  You should have seen him trying to weasel his way out -- anything not to let the case go forward. He was arguing it wasn't his jurisdiction.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: Oh, you're kidding me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I wish I was. Same argument 3rd time in a row. Barkley said it was an immigration issue.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: Barkley, that's classic.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: He thinks because I'm new to Australian law that I'm some kind of yokel or something.  Hey, hello -- homework.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: I told you, I need help.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: He needs help.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I'm a lawyer, sweetheart, I can tell when someone's stalling.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Who cares about birds of Australia, anyway? We're in Australia.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN:  You okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: I'm feeling kind of flu-ey.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Shouldn't we be studying birds of Egypt or something?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: You haven't been sleeping much lately. Maybe you need to take a personal day.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: I picked the Bronze Cuckoo (Walt mispronounces it "Kahuku"). It's funny. Wanna see?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: What about Barkley?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: I mean, it doesn't look funny, just the name.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Sleeping in late that's too much...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Hey, Brian, look, look. You're not looking. You're not looking.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SUSAN: Oh, my god.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Is it dead?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: Yeah, poor guy.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Vincent! Vincent!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: Michael Dawson?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Yeah, can I help you?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: Yeah. I'm Brian Porter.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Susan's Brian?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: Yeah. Can I come in? I need to talk to you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Susan know you're here, man?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: Susan died yesterday. Please .
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Um... 
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: She, uh, it turns out she had a blood disorder. She was only sick for about a week.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I didn't know. I, uh, I hadn't talked to her in a while. Sit down. And, Walt, how's he, uh...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: He's fine. He's back home with his nanny.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: I mean, he's fine -- I mean, considering, you know.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: You left him home after he just lost his mother?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: Before she died, Susan, she told me she wanted you to have custody of Walt.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: She what?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: Well, I think she just thought, I mean -- since you're his father.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I haven't been his father in 9 years.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: Yeah, well, that's kind of the thing, see. Look, I loved Susan very much. And I was honest with her from the beginning, but she -- she wouldn't hear it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Hear what?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: That I -- I didn't want to be a father. I just don't know how.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Hey, what the hell are you talking about, man?! You adopted him!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: Yes, yes, I did, because she wanted that, and I wanted her and... Look, these are two tickets - it's one round trip, the other one-way, Sydney to New York. The envelope has money in it for travel expenses.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: She didn't tell you she wanted me to have custody of him. This is your idea.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: I'm a wreck right now, okay. Don't you understand that?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I'm supposed to give a damn about you?!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: I just lost the woman I love, alright?! And I can't be his father-!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL:  You son-of-a-bitch, what the hell are you talking about?! You're the only father he knows!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: It's more than that!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Well, then what?!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: There's just -- there's something about him!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What the hell are you talking about, man?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BRIAN: Sometimes when he's around things happen. He's different somehow.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Over here.  What the hell wou...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT:  Help, please! Help!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Walt!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: This way.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Walt! Walt!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 NANNY: Walt should be home from school any minute.  Mr. Porter asked me to give you that - some of Susan's effects.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Oh, thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 NANNY: There's something else. 
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: What's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 NANNY: Something I think Walt should have. Excuse me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 NANNY: Walt?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 NANNY: There's somebody here to see you. 
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Dad!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Walt!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Dad! Dad, help, please.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Help!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Walt!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Dad!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE:  C'mon, up here. Michael.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Dad! Dad.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Hey, Walt.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Who are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I'm a -- I'm your father. Hey, um, I want you to know -- listen, I can't explain how sorry I am about your mom. You should know that we, hey, we loved each other very much when we had you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Where's Brian?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Brian's not here. I've come to bring you home with me.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: I'm not going anywhere with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Walt, can I?  I know this is really hard to understand. All of this. See Brian, Brian loves you very much. And he wants you to stay with him, but it's not his choice. It's mine. I'm your legal guardian. And it's not like he's going to disappear from your life. He'll still call you, write to you, come to see you whenever he can. And you know, you'll still have your dog.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: But Vincent isn't mine. He's Brian's.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Brian said you could have him.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Dad!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Hey, Walt!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Dad! Dad! Where are you dad?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Hang on!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Okay, okay, okay. Let's go. Hey, Walt, just hang in there, okay? I'm coming, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Dad!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Walt!  Throw me the knife. Walt!  If he comes near you, use it.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: Michael.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Stay there, buddy.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Dad!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Are you okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL:  Alright. Whatever you do, you hold onto this tight. Got me?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Tight!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: What about you?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Don't worry about me. I'll be right behind you, okay? Hold on. Okay, Locke, now! Pull!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Pull him, Locke!
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: I'm sorry. I'm sorry...
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: No, no, no, it's --, it's okay. We're okay. I'm just glad you're safe.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: But, Vincent. He ran off again.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: He found his way back to you once, Walt. He will again.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Hey, I've got a present for you.  Since you like to look at pictures.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: What's this?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Go ahead.  Every card, every letter I sent you over the last 8 years.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: You wrote me?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Mmhmm.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: I never saw these. Did my mom have these? Why didn't she give them to me?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: I don't know. But she didn't throw them away, either, which means, you know, somewhere inside she wanted you to have them.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: So, you drew these?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Just for you. This one I did for your 2nd birthday.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 WALT: A penguin -- with a sunburn? That's dumb.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 MICHAEL: Yeah, I know. That's what I said. 
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: Jack! Sayid. You have to hear this.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 JACK: What is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: It's Claire's, her diary.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAYID: You're reading her diary?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: Yeah, I know, I'm bloody scum. Just listen to this. "I had that weird dream again, the one with the black rock I can't get away from. I try to leave it but it won't let me."
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAYID: Black rock?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 JACK: It's just dreams, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: No, Sayid mentioned the Black Rock before.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 SAYID: The French woman said something about her team returning from the Black Rock. The triangle on the map. Maybe it's the triangle on the map?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 CHARLIE: Maybe it's where Claire was taken. Maybe she's there?
Lost.Season01.Episode14 JACK: Maybe. Charlie, we all want to find Claire, but there's no sense going out into the jungle in the middle of the night.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BOONE: I don't think that whistle's working, John.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: You can't hear everything, Boone. The sooner you learn that, the better.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 BOONE: Well, I heard that. Vincent. Vincent is that you? Vincent.
Lost.Season01.Episode14 LOCKE: Claire?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 VOICE:  Over here. Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE:  Where's Jack?  We need the doctor.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 VOICE: He's right there. Right there.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 VOICE: Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Doctor!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Claire?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 MICHAEL: Is she alive?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 WALT: What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Is she alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK:  Where did you find her?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: About a mile north. We were looking for the dog.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Was she conscious?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: She collapsed in my arms.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Did she say anything?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 HURLEY: Charlie, man! Is she injured?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 WALT: Is she alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Everybody needs to back off, okay? Just give her some air. . Claire, can you hear me? Wake up now. Hey, Claire, Claire. Wake up now. . Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Claire? It's okay. It's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Claire. You're safe.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: Who are you? Who are you?! Who are you people?!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: I don't understand. I don't know any Ethan. I don't remember. I don't remember any of you. I don't remember any of this.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: What do you remember?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: Um, I was on a plane flying to LA from Sydney.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Claire, we were all on that plane. It crashed here -- on this Island. That was almost a month ago.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: No, I'm, I'm due.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Your baby's fine. He's kicking, everything's normal. Okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: Well, if it's been almost a month then why hasn't somebody come to get us?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JIN: 도대체 무슨 일이 일어나는 거지? 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SUN: 저도 모르겠어요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JIN: 저 여자… 괜찮을까? 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SUN: 제 생각엔 괜찮은 것 같아요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JIN: 애기는? 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SUN: 애기도 무사하겠죠. 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 BOONE: You think she escaped?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: You were right beside me, Boone, you know as much as I do.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 BOONE: Well, where did she come from? I mean, we were out pretty deep. Nothing's out there.  She didn't say anything at all about Ethan?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Apparently she doesn't even remember Ethan.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 BOONE: The guy pretends to be one of us -- he drags her through the jungle for almost two weeks -- she doesn't remember him?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Apparently.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 BOONE: You think he's around?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: I sure hope not.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Claire, here's your journal. It might help.  And this is where you sleep. It's quite cozy, isn't it? When he -- Ethan -- when he took you away, he took me, too. The others came after us. They got me back, but you, you were gone.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: Who is he, Ethan?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Ethan? Ethan's the bad guy.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: So, we were together when...
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: Why did he leave you?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Why don't we leave that lovely story for the morning. You've had enough for one day.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: Ah, I won't be sleeping.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Oh, lucky for me. I'm not much of a sleeper myself. Finally, I'll have someone to stay up with.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: We're friends?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Yeah. Yeah, we're friends.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: How's that feel, mate?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Sodding fantastic.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: Good, 'cause, uh, we're almost out.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: But we're not out yet. Carpe Diem, my friend.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: Look, save your French for someone who appreciates it.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Latin, Tommy. It's Latin.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: Well, is it Latin for I've got a pile of money so we can score vast quantities of illicit substances?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: I suppose you ought to clean up then. It's time to put you to work.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY:  Miss Lucy Heatherton, 22, and right in oh so many wonderful ways. Just graduated from Oxford, lives in Knightsbridge with her dear old dad, Mr. Francis Price Heatherton who, my friend, is bloody loaded.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: How you amass this information never ceases to amaze me, Tommy.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: Ready to fall in love, Mr. Charlie Pace of the legendary rock band Drive Shaft?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Absolutely.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Seriously, ladies. I demand you stop buying me more drinks. I'm a man of high moral standing. Your obvious plans to take me home and ravish me will not work, saucy sirens. I believe in monogamy. I will not be shared like a common curry.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Are we that obvious?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Dreadfully. Call yourself ladies? Jane Austen would be ashamed. I personally...
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID: The girl is pregnant. Very pregnant. Are we supposed to believe that she escaped from him?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: What are you getting at?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID: Ethan infiltrated us. Whoever he is and wherever he comes from, he's intelligent. Who's to say he didn't even send Claire?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: You're off your head, mate! That-
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Charlie, calm down. That's a stretch, Sayid.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID: Then tell me, doctor, how many times have you diagnosed actual amnesia and such a selective brand of it?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Okay, it's rare. But she's been through a major trauma. It is possible that her memory reset to the crash.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: And the chances of that memory returning?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: You know what? You boys talk about Claire all you want. I'm actually going to go spend some time with her. I get the impression she might still be a tad upset.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Oi, Jin. You heading back to the caves? 안녕?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JIN: 안녕.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Safety in numbers, right? Of course, you have no idea what I'm talking about. How nice it must be to not be involved in the bloody insanity that surrounds us at every turn. It's quite beautiful, really. You take care of your wife. Everything else is someone else's problem. No need to be involved in the decision-making process. No tree-shaking behemoths, French transmissions, just sweet, bloody ignorance. You don't know how lucky you are, you know. Must be nice. You wake up and...
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 ETHAN: Charlie, I want her back.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: What? I...
Lost.Season01.Episode15 ETHAN: I want you to bring her back.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: What did you do to her?  What did you do?!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 ETHAN: You bring her here. If you don't, I'm going to kill one of them. And then, if you don't bring her back before sundown tomorrow, I'll kill another, and another, and another. One every day.  And Charlie, I'll kill you last.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: What do we do? We go out and we bloody kill him!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Calm down, Charlie. We don't want the others to get upset and...
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Forget the others. He's out there right now, Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: I think he's right. The man threatens to kill one of us unless we bring him Claire, and what, we just wait for that to happen? We tracked him once before, we can track him again.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: You both seem to have forgotten how that turned out.  He bested you physically.  He hung you from a tree. Running into the jungle unarmed is not going to get the job done.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: So what does get it done?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: We circle the wagons, tell a select few about the threat. We post some sentries here and back at the caves.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Tell a select few? He does what he says he going to do and that blood's on our hands.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Okay, Jack, we tell everyone. But, you want to protect them, you need to start thinking defense.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: We move everybody off the beach, back up into the caves.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: What if Ethan isn't alone? What if he delivered his threat so that we would gather like sheep to the slaughter in a confined space where they can roll in and take us all in one fell swoop.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Okay, John. Obviously, you have a plan. So, let's hear it.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SUN: 도대체 무슨 일이 있었냐구요? 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JIN: 무슨 일이 있었냐구? 내가 어떻게 알아? 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SUN: 아니 다른 사람들은 어떻게 이해를-- 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JIN: 다른 사람들? 내가 다른 사람들 때문에 이렇게 된건데. 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: The others are avoiding me.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Sorry?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: No one will talk to me. You know, it just feels like something is going on.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Anything coming back?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: After the crash, no. Some of this stuff's probably better forgotten anyway. 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Well, I don't know about you, but the rest of us have been having a wonderful time. We even built a golf course.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: You're sure there's nothing going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Absolutely.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: You're quite enamored with yourself, aren't you?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Now, Lucy, I know it's our first date and you want to appear demure, but, you know, if you want to invite me back for sex don't say tea, say sex.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Do you want tea, or not?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: I'd love some.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Brilliant.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: So where is the old man?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: I don't know. I think he's buying some paper company up in Slough.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Oh, yeah? Do you two get on?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Dad's quite cool, actually. He was rather proud when I told him I was going on a date with a bona fide rock star.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY:  It was Winston Churchill's. Dad collects all sorts of rubbish from the great leaders of the empire. Hey, you should meet him.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Winston? No thanks. I heard he's quite moldy.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: My father. He's coming back tomorrow. You should come round for dinner.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: I'd love to.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Excellent.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 KATE: You look hungry. 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 KATE: Locke told us what happened. Why do you think he wants her back?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 KATE: Maybe it's time you use that key you've been wearing around your neck. There are 4 nine millimeters in the Marshal's case and-
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Uh-uh. No. I hand them out, someone hears something out in the jungle and gets scared, the chances of us shooting each other are much higher than of us shooting him.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 KATE: We're beyond sharpening knives here, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: I am not putting guns in untrained hands.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Trip it!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID: Not bad.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: 4 of these around the perimeter will do the job.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID: I have fires prepared at 20 meter intervals.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Excellent.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID: Some of the men have volunteered for sentry duty. I'm going to put them on rotating shifts.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 BOONE: I'll take a shift.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Absolutely, we're counting on you, Boone.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Maybe we should move her.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: She's safer here.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: What about the mountain? There could be another cave?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: She's safer here, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE:  Nobody's safe!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: It's my fault he took her. I was responsible. I should have taken care of her. I should...
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Charlie, nothing's going to happen to her, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Yeah, okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 FRANK: Well, Charlie, I think my lovely daughter would agree that you're the most impressive person who's ever had dinner with us.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: My condolences, sir.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 FRANK: I don't know if Lucy mentioned it to you, but I was in a band once myself, you know.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Oh.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: They were called the Protestant Reformation.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 FRANK: Yes. Ouch. Dreadful, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: You gave it up then?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 FRANK: Well, I was married, Lucy was on the way. Her mom, god rest her soul, wanted me to keep trying, but I was wanting to be more practical, responsible, I guess. You know, a man has to provide, take care of his family. A man has to think about the future.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: And, of course, your band was bloody awful.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 FRANK: Yes, there was that, too. Small detail. So, are you working on a new album, Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: We're in a bit of a hiatus right now. Liam, my brother, just had a daughter. So, you know, we're taking some time off. Quite a lot of time off, actually. It's been a year since we were together. I'm thinking of doing a solo project. Liam and I don't exactly keep in touch and there's been some problems with royalties. The fact of the matter is, sir, uh, I think that Drive Shaft might be dead.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: You took a sodding what?!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: A job, Tom.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: A job doing what?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Selling copiers.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: You took a job selling copiers?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: I like her.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: She's a moose.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Don't say that.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: Are you off your bleeding chump, man? I've been getting you off on my skag for over a week now on spec. Spec means speculation.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Yes, I know what speculation means.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: In this case, the speculation that you'll execute your end of the plan and steal something of value which I can, in turn, sell. And by the time the poor helpless bird realizes it's missing it never even occurs to her that rock star Charlie bloody Pace could be responsible for such larceny, and the bloody party continues.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Look, I -- I don't think Liam's coming back. I have to think about my future.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: Your future?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: Really?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: When do you start this job?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Monday.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 TOMMY: Today's Friday, isn't it? After a weekend without a fix, Monday should be bloody wonderful. Let's see how the future treats you then, hey, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE:  Over here -- through the tree line -- something tripped the alarm.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID:  I think we found another missing castaway.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 BOONE: What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID: Is he alive?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 BOONE: Oh, god.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID: How did he get past us?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 HURLEY: I thought those guys had a full on perimeter set up?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 KATE: Locke said it didn't matter -- he came in from the water.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 HURLEY: You sure it wasn't an accident? I mean, maybe the guy just drowned or something.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 KATE: His neck was broken, both his arms, all the bones in his fingers.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 HURLEY: Yeah, okay. Got it.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAWYER:  So, Steve drew the short straw.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 HURLEY: Dude, that was Scott.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 HURLEY: Scott Jackson worked for an internet company in Santa Cruz. He won a sales prize: two week Australian vacation, all expenses paid. He was a good guy. Sorry, I kept calling you Steve, man. Um, amen, I guess. I...
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SEVERAL PEOPLE: Amen.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 HURLEY: I don't know how to end these.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE:  Hi. Why is everyone staring at me?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SHANNON: I'm not staring at you.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: What's your name?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SHANNON: Shannon.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: Shannon, you're staring.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SHANNON: You mean nobody's told you?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: Told me what?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE:  Why? Why did you lie to me?!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Okay, look...
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: Yeah, what else didn't you tell me?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: I just thought with your memory there wasn't anything you could do.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: Nothing I could do? Why would you keep me in the dark, Charlie? I'm already in the dark.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Sorry. I just wanted to take care of you.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: I can take care of myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Look at you. Charlie Pace, respectable businessman.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: You didn't have to buy me this suit, Lucy.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Mmhm. And what did you intend on wearing for your first day of work?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: I have shirts... with buttons.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: You okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Yeah, just a bit nervous.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Don't be. Dad's put the fix in. He's already demanded they buy two copiers to boost your confidence.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY:  Have you memorized the manual?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Backwards and forwards.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Say something impressive.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Uh, the Heatherton C815 copy center's leading scan offerings combine the benefits of document capture with instant delivery anywhere, anytime.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Anywhere?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Anytime, baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: You've been on stage in front of thousands of screaming fans. This is just some men who want to buy a silly copy machine. You're going to do great. I believe in you. Oh, almost forgot, wait here.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Okay. 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Alright, now, I know you'll protest, but you simply can't be respected unless you have one of these. 
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Oh, Lucy.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: You're welcome.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Okay, well. I'm going to be late -- the bus.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: The bus? Are you daft? I'm driving you.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Oh, no, Lucy. I'd rather you didn't.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: No argument. Have everything you need?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Then let's get you to work.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: John, want to take a walk?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: What do you think happens after the sun sets tonight?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Oh, if we don't bring Claire to him? Rhetorical, Jack. Same thing happens tonight as happened last night.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: You think you can track him?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Well, I'm sorry?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: We know where he attacked Jin and Charlie. Do you think you can pick up the trail?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Maybe, but I wouldn't.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Wouldn't?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Jack, I'm not a cold man. I feel for the loss of one of our own, but nothing fundamental is changed. Wherever he is, wherever he comes from, we're on Ethan's turf. He has the advantage. To him we're nothing more than a bunch of scared idiots with sharp sticks.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: What if I told you I had a way to get the advantage back?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Then I would ask: what way might that be, Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Why, doctor, you've been holding out on us.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: I'm guessing you know how to handle one of these?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Are you insane?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: It's the best chance we have, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: No bloody way!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID: If you want to capture Ethan, we have to ensnare him. And the only way do that is by giving him what he wants.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: You have no idea what you're talking about. This guy, he will kill all of you. You can't protect her...
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE:  Charlie, I can talk for myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Claire, they want to use you as bait.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: I don't remember Ethan. I don't remember what he did to me. But if I can help stop him from hurting anyone else, I have to do that.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: I'm coming with you. You said there were 4 guns.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: You ever fire a weapon, Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Alright, we should do this. Let's figure out a game plan. Alright, Sayid, you're the soldier. Locke, you're the hunter. . .
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Allow me to demonstrate the awesome speed of the C815 using one your technical manuals.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Charlie's right.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: About what?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: We have 4 guns, we should have 4 men.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAWYER: Help? Moi?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: You know how to handle a gun, or not?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAWYER: Well, I know at least one polar bear that seems to think so.  Where'd you get the hardware, Hoss?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 KATE: I want to come.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Sorry, we're out of guns. And no one goes out there unarmed.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAWYER: How much ammo you got?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: 100 rounds give or take.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAWYER: All 9's, right? 9 millimeters -- the guns?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Yeah, why?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAWYER: Because, if the lady wants to come...  Lifted this off the Marshal back in the old days. Remember him, don't you? Surly guy, kind of square of jaw, carries a Sig 9.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Yeah, I remember you shot him. And missed.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAWYER: Yeah, well, bygones. And hell, 5 guns are better than 4.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID: He'll be surrounded at 5 points. Everyone will be in visual contact with you. Make sure you stay in the area I've shown you. And remember, guns are a measure of the last resort. We want him alive.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LOCKE: Over here! Over here! Jack's got him! Hold your fire. Don't shoot. We want him alive. Claire!  You alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAWYER:  Over here!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAYID: Hey, hold your fire!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAWYER: Easy.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 SAWYER: Winner by a knockout. Nice one, Doc. Now, maybe somebody can tell me just who or what this son-of-bitch is!  Uh, uh, uh, jungle boy. Not even for one second.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Charlie?!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: Why did you do it, Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Because he deserved to die.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 JACK: He could have told us where he came from, what he wanted with Claire, why he...
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Do you really think he would have told us anything, Jack? I wasn't going to let that animal anywhere near her again. Ever.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Lucy, I'm sorry. I've been having some problems. If I could just explain...
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Leave, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Lucy, I made a mistake.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: You made a mistake? My father's sales manager comes here to my house to return a cigarette case that the EMTs pulled from your suit pocket at the bloody hospital, and it still smells of your sick.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE:  I didn't mean to.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Oh, you meant to, Charlie. You meant to from the start. You're a liar! I believed you and you lied! I thought you wanted to -- you said -- you selfish bastard!
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Lucy, if I can just explain.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: Tell me one thing, and don't you dare lie to me. I get why you pretended to like me. I understand why you stole, because you're a junkie. But I don't understand why you took the job. Why did you take the job, Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: I guess I -- I wanted to be respectable. I wanted you to think that I could take care of you.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 LUCY: You'll never take care of anyone.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: I remember peanut butter. Why do I remember peanut butter?
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: It was imaginary peanut butter, actually.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CLAIRE: I don't know what happened to me. I'm scared. I want to trust you. Goodnight, Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode15 CHARLIE: Goodnight, Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 MARY: Wake up. He's here. C'mon. Got to get you up. He'll think you're still with your grandparents, okay? Get under the bed. Let's go. Okay. Listen to mommy, this is really important. Get under the bed, don't make a sound. Don't come out, no matter what happens. Don't come out, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 YOUNG SAWYER: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 MARY: I love you.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 YOUNG SAWYER: I love you too, mommy.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 MARY: Let's go. Down you go.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER'S FATHER: Open this door!
Lost.Season01.Episode16 MARY: Stop it! Please stop it! Go away! Stop it!
Lost.Season01.Episode16 MARY: What the hell is wrong with you?! I'm calling the police, get out of here. What are you doing? What the hell are you doing with a gun, get out of...
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: Boar took your tarp?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: It was dark, but yeah, I'm pretty sure it was a boar.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: I thought the boar had vacated this area?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, genius, I think we got some bad info.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: What was he doing inside your tent?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: It was staring at me. Then it came at me, so I hit it, and it ran off into the jungle.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: With you tarp? Perhaps he wanted to go camping?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: You enjoying yourself?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, laugh it up, Mohammad. But I come back and find my stuff's gone, I'm coming after you.  Sayid, what did you hear? After you ran into the French woman you said you heard something in the jungle.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: I was injured and I was exhausted, my mind was playing tricks.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: What did you hear?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: I thought I heard whispering.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: What was it saying?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: Why? Did you hear something?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Forget it. I didn't hear anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 MARY JO: What are you so afraid of?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I'm not the one trembling, sweetness.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HIBBS:  Okay, this is really awkward, but if I don't say something now, things are liable to get downright embarrassing.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Hibbs.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HIBBS: Hello, Sawyer. Ma'am, I must apologize. I -- I figured my good friend Sawyer here would be alone. I just need a few minutes.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Listen, baby...
Lost.Season01.Episode16 MARY JO: Baby, who is this?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Listen, go down to the bar, get a drink...
Lost.Season01.Episode16 MARY JO: No, I don't want to leave you here.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: As soon as I get rid of him, then I'll come get you and I'll explain everything.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 MARY JO: But, I...
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Listen, just trust me on this. I will find you, I promise. I promise.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HIBBS: I've got to hand it to you, Sawbucks. How you find women that beautiful to work your grift.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Now, if I'm not mistaken, I'm fairly certain I said I'd kill you if I ever saw you again.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HIBBS: That's why I'm here, to make things right. Besides, we both know you ain't the killing type.  Here. I figure that makes us even for the Tampa job.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: What could possibly make us even for the Tampa job?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HIBBS: How about the known whereabouts of the man who ruined your life? I'm going to make myself a drink. You want one? You remember old man Parks, right? Ran capper for us on that gig in Atlanta.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Yeah, what about him?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HIBBS: He's been working the wire at an off track parlor down in Sydney. So, last week one of his regulars gets a little too sauced, starts running his mouth off about his glory days as a grifter. That guy, Frank Duckett. Real hard luck case - gambling addict, alcoholic, runs a shrimp truck. Back in the day this guy Duckett was quite the hustler. He ran the romance angle, hooked the wife and took the husband for all the money. He was pretty good at it, too, from what I hear. Till, sadly, one of his marks, in despair, took a gun, shot up his wife and blew his own head off. All in front of their little boy. I paid Tony to pull his jacket. Turns out Frank Duckett used to be named Frank Sawyer. A name I believe you appropriated for yourself.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER:  This is him?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HIBBS: That's him.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Thanks for the loaner.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: Always a pleasure.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: So, was anyone curious where they came from?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: The others knew there was a Marshal on the plane. I guess they just assumed he was traveling alone, protecting them from terrorists. Sounds like a good theory to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Did you get all the guns back?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: All except one.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Who?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: Let me give you 3 guesses.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Sawyer. I can get it back.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: Really? How are you going to do that?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Speak his language.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: You've done this before, Kate. And if I remember it right, you made out with him, and he never even had what you said you could get.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Well, I only made out with him because torturing him didn't work.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: Let him keep the gun. It's not worth it.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: What, are you worried he's going to shoot me if I ask?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: I just don't want you to owe him anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CLAIRE: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHARLIE: Hi. How are you feeling?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CLAIRE: Very pregnant. I -- I had some dreams last night. Actually, more like memories. You were in them.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHARLIE: Sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CLAIRE: Thought I'd see if you wanted to go for a walk.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHARLIE: Sorry. I have to... do something.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CLAIRE: Sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHARLIE: See you later, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER:  Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: A boar? Did all this?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Last night -- wrecked my tent. This morning when I went to get my tent back it attacks me from behind and runs off into the jungle like a coward.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: A boar wouldn't just attack you for no reason.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Thank you, boar expert. This one did. It's harassing me. 
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: What are doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Getting even.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Would you listen to yourself? It's a boar. Just go tell Locke and he'll kill it.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Nope. This is my fight.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Do you know anything about hunting boar? You are going to get yourself lost, or worse.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Since when do you care?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: I don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Good. Then if you'll excuse me, I've got some revenge to tend to.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 LAURENCE: You must be Hibbs' mate.  I did a few jobs with Hibbs back in the States. Nice enough fella.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: He's a son of a bitch.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 LAURENCE: Right, indeed he is. A few disclaimers: Australia doesn't allow its citizens to carry handguns. You get nicked with this...
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I'm not going to rat you out.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 LAURENCE: Secondly, you know, I've been doing this for awhile and a man who buys a compact 357 with hollow point loads -- he's not looking to scare or steal. He's looking to kill. But when it comes down to it, if he finds he doesn't have what it takes to do the job...
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Your sales pitch needs some work.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 LAURENCE: What I'm saying is, you look a man in the eye and you point a gun at him, you find who you really are, mate. And should you find you're not a killer, there's no refund.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Won't be a problem.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHARLIE: Hurley, look, I appreciate the help. You don't have to. I killed Ethan, I can bury him.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HURLEY: Yeah, 'til he rises from the dead. Dude, I know how this works. This is going to end with you and me running through the jungle screaming and crying. He catches me first because I'm heavy and I get cramps.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HURLEY: You alright? 
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HURLEY: Yo, Sayid, can I ask you a question?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: Of course.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HURLEY: Did you ever get that Gulf War syndrome?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: That was the other side.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HURLEY: Oh, right. Then what's the one when you're all, like, shell-shocked?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HURLEY: Yeah, that's it. Did you ever have that?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: Why do you ask?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HURLEY: Because I'm worried about Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: What's wrong with Charlie?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 HURLEY: I mean, he killed a guy. He shot him in the chest 4 times. Maybe you should talk to him.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE:  It's a foot print. Based on the weight and the distance between strides, I'd say you've been following Boone for about an hour.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Look...
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: It could be Charlie, I suppose.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I'm tickled you're taking such an interest in my affairs. I really am. So don't take it personal when I tell you to go...
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: I want carte blanche.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: It's simple. You can't track this boar without my help. Over the last few hours you have managed to follow the tracks of humans, birds, a rock slide, yourself, basically everything except boar. You have no idea what you're doing.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Carte blanche...
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: It means blank check.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I know what it means.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Anytime I want something from your stash -- medicine, soap, whatever -- I get it. No questions asked. Take it or leave it.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Alright, you got a deal.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Where did you get that?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Jack was looking for the liquor cart.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: It's a good thing I found it instead, then, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Got any more of those?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I've got a lot more of everything, but you ain't got carte blanche yet.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Is that a no?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Alright, sassafras, but if you want to drink, you've got to play.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Play what?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I never.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I never.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: How am I supposed to know what that means?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Call it a way to get to know each other better. For example, I know you've never been to college.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: And how do you know that?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: If you had, you'd have heard about I never. It's simple, you say "I never" and then you finish the sentence. If it's something you did you drink, if it's something you never did, you don't drink.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: That makes absolutely no sense.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Learn by example. I never kissed a man. Now you drink 'cause you've kissed man. Your turn.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: I never implied that I've been to college when I never have.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I never been to Disneyland.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Ah, that's just sad.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: I never wore pink.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: I knew it.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: The '80's. I never voted democrat.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: I never voted.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I've never been in love.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: You've never been in love?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I ain't drinking, am I?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: I've never had a one night stand.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Bottoms up, sailor.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I've gotta drink for each one.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Your turn.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I've never been married.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: It didn't last very long. I never blamed a boar for all my problems.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I never cared about having carte blanche because I just wanted to spend some time with the only other person on this Island that just don't belong.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: I never carried a letter around for 20 years because I couldn't get over my baggage.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I never killed a man.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, looks like we got something in common, after all.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: You okay? You were shaking.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I'm fine. I was just having a...
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I can't believe this.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: There are hoof marks everywhere.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: It ate all our stuff?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Nope. It ate your stuff. Mine's fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Oh, that hog's gonna suffer. I swear to god.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 LOCKE: Mornin'. What happened to your campsite?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: So, what are you doing all the way out here, John?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 LOCKE: Looking for salvage from the crash.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Find anything useful?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 LOCKE: Occasional scrap of metal, a few bags of coffee. I picked up your path about a mile back, I thought I'd say howdy.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER:  Awww, son of a -- ohhh, peed on my shirt! Took my shirt out of the bag and peed on it! And you say this ain't personal.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: He thinks the boar we're after has a vendetta against him.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 LOCKE: Uh-huh.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: That's 3 times it's attacked me.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Maybe it's got your scent, doesn't like your cologne?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I don't wear cologne.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Yes, you do.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Yeah, well. The thing's got it in for me.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: It's a boar, Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 LOCKE:  My sister, Jeanie, died when I was a boy. Fell off the monkey bars and broke her neck. And my mother, well, my foster mother, she blamed herself, of course. She thought she wasn't watching close enough. So, she stopped eating, stopped sleeping. The neighbors started talking, afraid she might do something to herself, I guess.  Oh, that's good. Anyway, about 6 months after Jeanie's funeral, this golden retriever comes padding up our driveway, walks right into our house, sits down on the floor, and looks right at my mother, there on the couch. And my mother looks back at the dog. After about a minute of this, of them both staring at each other like that, my mother burst into tears. Beautiful dog, no tags, no collar, healthy, and sweet. The dog slept in Jeanie's old room, on Jeanie's old bed and stayed with us until my mother passed 5 years later. Then, disappeared back to wherever it was she came from in the first place.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: So, you're saying the dog was your sister?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 LOCKE: Well, that would be silly. But my mother thought it was, thought that Jeanie had come back to tell her the accident wasn't her fault, let her off the hook.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 DUCKETT:  Good to go.  Only two choices, shrimp in mild sauce, shrimp in hot sauce.  Ssss, Pal?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I'll go with the hot.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 DUCKETT: Hot it is.  Fellow American, huh? Good for you. You missed the lunch rush. Whereabouts you from?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Tennessee.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 DUCKETT: Yeah. I love the south. Miss those southern women.  In Australia long?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Not really.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 DUCKETT: For what it's worth, we've got a special at the truck here. Half price for all Americans. Name's Frank, by the way.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: James.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 DUCKETT: Good to meet you, James. One shrimp and hot sauce.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER:  Again.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 BARTENDER: Are you sure about that, mate?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Again.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: You tell 'em, cowboy. These bastards think Americans can't hold their liquor. I, uh, I hate to hold my hand out, but I seem to have misplaced my wallet.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Set him up.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: I drink to you. What's your name, cowboy.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: To Sawyer, may he find whatever he's looking for in the bottom of a glass. So, Sawyer, what brings you to Sydney?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Business.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: You know why they call Australia down under, don't you? Because it's as close as you can get to hell without being burned.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER:  How about you leave the bottles?  What'd you handle, back in the States?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: I was a Chief of Surgery.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Was?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Yeah, was.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: So, we're in hell, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Don't let the air conditioning fool you, son. You are here, too. You are suffering. But, don't beat yourself up about it. It's fate. Some people are just supposed to suffer. That's why the Red Sox will never win the damn series. I have a son who's about your age. He's not like me, he does what's in his heart. He's a good man, maybe a great one. And right now, he thinks that I hate him. He thinks I feel betrayed by him. But what I really feel is gratitude, and pride because of what he did to me. What he did for me. It took more courage than I have. There's a pay phone over here. I could pick it up and I could call my son. I could tell him about all this. I could tell him that I love him. One simple phone call and I could fix everything.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Why don't you?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Because I am weak. This -- this business that you have, will it ease your suffering?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Then what are you doing here?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: It ain't that simple.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Of course it is. Unless you want to end up like me, of course it is.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: You're developing quite a talent.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHARLIE: Yeah. -- I get it. You're here to check up on me.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: You killed a man.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHARLIE: A man who killed one of us, who kidnapped Claire, who strung me up and left me for dead. He deserved to die. I'd do it again in a minute. Pardon me, if I'm fresh out of bad feeling.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: When I was in the army in Tikrit, in Iraq, the man who lived next door was a policeman. One day his car was rigged with a bomb. It killed his wife and 3 young children instead. They caught the man who did it. I volunteered to be on the firing squad, and I did my duty without a single ounce of remorse. Then, for no reason, I found myself waking up at night, replaying what I did in my head.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHARLIE: It looks like you're the one who needs checking up on.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: All I'm saying is that what happened with Ethan will be with you for the rest of your life.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHARLIE: Any suggestions?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAYID: You're not alone. Don't pretend to be.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I take comfort knowing that someday this all going to be a real nice shopping complex. Maybe even an auto mall. Where you going?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE:  Know what that is?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: A hole in the mud.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: It's a wallow.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: What the hell's a wallow?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: A boar's wallow? It's a den where he sleeps. And these tree rubbings are from his tusks.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: You mean he's around here?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Maybe.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Sawyer?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Gotcha, ha ha ha.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: I thought it'd be bigger.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Funny. Now we know daddy's got to be around here. Here piggy, piggy, piggy.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Hey, Sawyer, put it down. That's not funny.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Here piggy, piggy, piggy!
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Put it down. What is the matter with you, Sawyer?! You're going to hurt it!
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: We're right over here!
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: Not funny.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Oww.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE: You're sick.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: I didn't hurt it.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 KATE:  Find your own way home.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: No problem!
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Sawyer.  I've got a letter for you.  "Dear Mr. Sawyer..."
Lost.Season01.Episode16 DUCKETT: Who?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: You used to go by the name of Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 DUCKETT: What the hell are you talking about? You didn't have to -- tell Hibbs I would've paid.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: How do you know Hibbs?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 DUCKETT: You don't -- you don't know what you're doing, do you?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: You borrowed money from Hibbs?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 DUCKETT: I was going to pay. It'll come back around.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Kate?!
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: It's just a boar. Let's get back to camp.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHARLIE: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CLAIRE: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CHARLIE: Want to take that walk now?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 CLAIRE: Sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Stick 'em up.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: Trying to be funny?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Yeah, I was fresh out of pies to throw at you. Here you go, sheriff.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: I asked you for this 2 days ago.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: And I told you, stick it. But I made a deal with your girlfriend.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: What did she give you? Kate -- what did she give you?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Nothing she wasn't willing to part with.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: That's why the Sox will never win the series.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: What's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: Huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: What'd you just say?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: I said "That's why the Red Sox will never win the series".
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: It's just something my father used to say -- going through life knowing that people hated him. Instead of taking responsibility for it, he just put it on fate. Said he was made that way.
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: Your daddy, he a doctor, too?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 JACK: Was. He is dead. Why do you want to know about my father?
Lost.Season01.Episode16 SAWYER: No reason.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MR. PAIK: 내 딸과 결혼하려는 이유가 뭔가? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 아버님 -- 지금은 보잘 것 없는 시골 출신이지만, 제게는 야망이 있습니다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MR. PAIK: 야망이라… 그게 뭐지? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 우선 식당을 열고… 더 나아지면 호텔을 갖고 싶습니다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MR. PAIK: 자네 아버님은 이 결혼에 대해 어떻게 생각하시나? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 제 아버지는… 돌아가셨습니다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MR. PAIK: 내 딸을 위해 자네가 뭘 해줄 수 있지? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 뭐든지 하겠습니다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MR. PAIK: 내가 시키는 어떤 일도? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 네. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MR. PAIK: 꿈을 그렇게 쉽게 파는 사람에게 내 딸을 왜 줘야 하지? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 따님은 -- 제 꿈이니까요. 아버님. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN:  뭐하고 있어? 정신이 나갔어? 빨리 나와! 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 왜 그래요? 수영 좀 하고 나왔는데.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 말이라고 해?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 이 수영복이 어때서 그래요?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 아이 참! 다른 수영복도 있는데 왜 이걸 입어?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 알았어요!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 가자! 아니, 빨리 가자!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: There they go again.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 CLAIRE: Do you think we should do something?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 CHARLIE: What should we do?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 다른 사람들이 다 보잖아!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 KATE: I don't know, he just walked up and started going off on her again.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 왜 그래요!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 이제 남편 말이 말 같지가 않아?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Hey, hey, hey -- get your hands off of her.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 너랑 상관이 없는 일인데 왜 끼어들어?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: I swear to god, you put your hands on her one more time...
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN:  네가 뭔데! 남의 일에 끼어들지 마!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL:  Get your hands off of me.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 저 녀석하고 무슨 일이 있었어? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 누구요? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 마이클 말이야. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 말도 안되는 소리. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 진짜? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 아무 일도 없었어요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 BEST FRIEND: 색깔 너무 예쁘다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 괜찮아? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 BEST FRIEND: 너무 예뻐, 맘에 들어. 너 너무 좋겠다, 결혼도 하고... 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 질투하는 거야? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 BEST FRIEND: 아니. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN:  제 와이프랑 단 둘이서 할 얘기가 있는데요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 BEST FRIEND:  선, 손님들 아랫층에 있는거 잊지 마, 알았지? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 어, 알았어.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 자기야, 나 너무 행복해.  아버님이 살아계셔서 우리 결혼식을 보셨더라면 참 좋았을텐데.   미안해요, 내가 괜한말을 했나봐. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 아니야. 괜찮아. 어디에 계시든 기뻐하셨을거야. [Subtitle: No. Wherever he is. I'm sure he is proud of me.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 지퍼 좀 올려줄래요? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN:  꼭 올려야 돼? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 자기야 우리 신혼여행 어떻게 할거야? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 아... 선. 나도 가고 싶지만, 지금은 안 되잖아. 지금은 아버님께 좋은 모습을 보여야 돼. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 내가 아빠 딸인데... 우리 결혼식 하는 걸 가지고 뭐라고 하시겠어? 응? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 6개월 후에, 경영 수업을 마치고 가자.  
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 아빠 자동차 회사만큼 나도 중요하잖아. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN:  내가 약속할게. 그땐 우리가 꿈꾸던 멋진 신혼여행이 될거야. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: Michael? I'm sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Don't worry. I stuck my nose where it didn't belong. It's on me.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: You must understand that-
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Look, all I understand is that I've got to get this raft finished so I can get my boy out of here and take him home.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: When I slapped you I was protecting you.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Oh, yeah? From what?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: From Jin. You don't know what he's capable of.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: It's not my problem. It's yours.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HURLEY:  You should try sea urchin. They've got more ping. Hey, so listen, I know things got kind of nasty down there at the beach, and, um, I don't want to get involved in husband and wife stuff, but I figured, you know, you might need to relax.  So...  C'mon, dude, I'm trying here. Okay, you want to be an outsider? It's your business.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: I tied this side down. Do you think this is going to hold?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAYID: Do you have a past in the Navy you neglected to tell me about?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAYID: How does a woman like you learn to tie a perfect bowline knot?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: By dating guys with sailboats?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAYID: Since you bring it up. I've been worried since I first met you that you might end up being a spinster.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: Spending my Saturday nights alone at home, tying knots?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAYID: Perhaps with an overweight aunt? It's a very sad image.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: Maybe we should get some rope, spend a Saturday night alone together, and see what happens.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: Dad...
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Thanks. You are going to love New York, Walt. No city like it. You know, what I really want to show you in New York are the buildings, the architecture...
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: Buildings?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Yeah, I used to say that, too, 'til I saw the Flat Iron Building.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: What's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Oldest skyscraper in the city, built in 1902. And it's flat. That one building inspired me to start drawing and, you know, designing things.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: You've just got to see it, man. You want to see it, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: I guess. Could I go throw the ball to Vincent?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Yeah, sure, of course.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: Come on, Vincent.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK:  Wow, you're making a lot of progress.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Yeah, trying.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: It's pretty cool.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Got this bamboo for the decking. Got a piece of the fuselage for a cabin, some storage bins. -- What's up?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: I thought I'd give you the heads-up.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: Yeah, there's a lot of talk going on about who's going on this thing with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Hey man, it's not the Queen Mary. I've only got room for 4 people. There's one open spot.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: Who took the other one?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAWYER: What's the matter, Doc? Feelin' left out?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: You're taking Sawyer with you?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAWYER: Yep, bought myself a ticket on this little tub. Let me tell you, the fare was steep.  I could've used that cable to hold up the whole east wing of my new beach house.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: You sold him a spot?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: I needed the halyards for the mast.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAWYER: Good thing I'm a saver, not a spender, huh, Doc?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 KATE: How much longer are you going to let him treat you this way?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: Please...
Lost.Season01.Episode17 KATE: Sun...
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: He's my husband...
Lost.Season01.Episode17 KATE: Yeah, a husband you're afraid to tell you speak English. I'm trying to understand, Sun.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: He wasn't always like this. He used to tell me how beautiful I looked to him. He was so tender. And then he was different.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 KATE: What changed him?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 KATE: Hey, Charlie, what's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 CHARLIE: The raft, it's on fire, look.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: No, no, no.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL:  Where is he? Where the hell is he?!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Where is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 무슨 말씀 하시는지 모르겠어요.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Where is he?!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: She doesn't understand you, man!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Hey! Where is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 KATE: Back off.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: No, her husband did this, and she knows. You're trying to protect him now, is that it?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 KATE: She was with me!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Walt, hey Walt. Get back. Get back.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: I was...
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: No, no. It's done.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 KATE: Sun, wait.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: I'm going to break his damn neck!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: Take it easy, man. We don't know that Jin did this.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAWYER: Are you serious?!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: Sawyer, shut up!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 CHARLIE: Jack, c'mon, we saw him on the beach this morning.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: That doesn't mean that he torched the raft.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Yeah, then who did, Jack?!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 여보, 뭐 하는 거에요? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 좀 다쳤어. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 당신이 이런 거에요?   마이클은... 이 섬에서 우리를 탈출시키려고 노력하는데 왜 그런 사람... 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 마이클? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 이번 일은 제가 모두 책임지겠습니다. 공장 기계가 나간 걸 제가 미리 체크하지 못했습니다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MR. PAIK: 자네를 문책하려고 부른게 아니고... 자네 승진 얘기를 하려고 부른거야. 이제 자네가 내 새로운 보좌관이 되어주게. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 회장님, 죄송하지만 무슨 말씀이신지... 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MR. PAIK: 한병철이라고 아나? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 환경 차관 말씀이십니까? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MR. PAIK: 오늘 밤 메시지를 그에게 전달해주게. '내가 섭섭한 점이 참 많아서 그래.'  
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HAN: 당신 누구시죠? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 안녕하십니까. 전 권진수라고 합니다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HAN: 무슨 일로 오셨죠? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 백 회장님 밑에서 일하고 있습니다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HAN: 미스터 권, 네... 들어오세요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HAN: 우선 이쪽으로 앉으세요. 뭐 마실 것 좀 드릴까요? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 아니 괜찮습니다. 여기 회장님의 메시지를 전하러 왔습니다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HAN: 제발, 부탁합니다. 우리 딸 앞에서만은... 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 회장님이 굉장히 섭섭해 하시는데요... 그 말만... 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HAN: 아, 그래요? 고맙습니다. 고마워요! 회장님께 앞으로는 섭섭한 일 없도록 하겠다고 전해주세요. 어떻게라도 사과를 해야 하는데... 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HAN: 이 개는 당신께 드리는 선물입니다. 이 개는 품종이 좋은 개에요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 차관님. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HAN: 정말 비싼 개에요. 회장님께 사과 드린다고 꼭 전해주세요. 그래 주실 수 있죠? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 저는 이걸 받을 수 없습니다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HAN: 받아주세요. 제발 받아주세요. 고맙습니다. 정말 고맙습니다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 BOONE: What do you want?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAYID: I'd like to talk to you about Shannon. It's very possible your sister and I are going to become more than just friends.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 BOONE: What is this? Some Middle Eastern thing? You want my blessing or something?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAYID: My hope is you won't object.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 BOONE: Yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAYID: I was extending a courtesy, not asking your permission.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 BOONE: Let me tell you about my sister. She likes older men, guys who can take care of her. My guess is, in this place, you fit the bill. She'll make you feel like the greatest guy ever while you get her food, or whatever it is that she needs. And when she gets whatever it is that she wants, she'll move on. When she does, don't take it personally, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAWYER:  You messed up my ride, Chief.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: Hey, there you are. Come, help me with this, I'm completely destroying it.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAYID: You seem to be doing just fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: Yeah, in trying making it collapse.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAYID: You're very capable, Shannon. I'm sure you'll be alright building it on your own.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAYID: Perhaps you should find another friend to help you with your shelter.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: You've been talking to my brother, haven't you?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: Oh, gross.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Gross to you, dinner to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: Boone, where is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: What do you mean you don't know? You two are like jungle pals.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Sorry, I haven't seen him.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: Well, if you do see him, tell him to keep his stupid mouth shut. And if he does have something to say, he can leave Sayid out of it, and come say it to my face.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Should I be writing this down?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: Just tell him to stay the hell out of my business.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Do you like him?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Sayid.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: Are you serious?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Because if you do -- like him, what's it got to do with your brother? You're a grown woman. Sure, you can yell at Boone 'til you're blue in the face, but all you're doing is giving him what he wants.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: Yeah, what's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Your attention. Everyone gets a new life on this Island, Shannon. Maybe it's time you start yours.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAWYER: You're pretty scared, huh? Scared, you understand scared, don't you? Huh?  If you ain't, you're going to be, Bruce. Folks down on the beach might have been doctors and accountants a month ago, but it's Lord of the Flies time, now.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 계속 걷고... 여기서 스톱! 돌고, 앉으세요.  쨘! 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 와... 진수성찬이네. 당신이 만들었어? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 그럼... 자기를 위해서 만들었지. 우리 오랜만에 같이 저녁식사하는 거니까 맛있게 드세요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 그래, 아주 잘 했어. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 걱정 마. 오늘은 일 안 해. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 정말 고마워요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 그래, 나도 고마워. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 이거 먹어봐요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MR. PAIK: 내 공장 문 닫게 만들었다 이거지? 메시지 못 전한 네 무능력 때문에 몇십 억을 손해본 줄 알아! 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MR. PAIK: 한병철 집에 이 사람 데려다 줘. 이 사람 하는 걸 보고 잘 배워! 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WHITE SUIT: 2분 안에 처리할 테니 시동은 끄지 마시오. 내가 일 끝내고 돌아오면 빨리 운전해서... 시내와 떨어진 한가한 강가로 갑시다. 알겠소? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HAN: 여보! 빨리 피해! 미스터 권, 내 말 좀 들어봐! 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 내일 바로 공장 문 열어! 내가 당신 목숨을 구했다는 걸 명심해.   이 정도면 알아듣겠죠. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 여보... 여보! 말 좀 해봐. 다쳤어? 이 피는 누구 피야? 밖에서 무슨 일 있었구나, 어?  밖에서 무슨 일 있었냐구? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 일 하고 왔어. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 일 하고 왔다구? 도대체 아빠 밑에서 무슨 일을 하는거야?  
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 아버님이 시키는 대로 할 뿐이야. 다 우리를 위해서 하는거야. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: Michael! Take it easy!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: I'll take it easy, alright!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HURLEY: Hang on, man. You've got to slow down. Slow down!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL:  Hey, man. You burn my raft?!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: Just calm down. Calm down and take a breath.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: You burn my raft?! Why'd you burn my raft, man?!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: Just calm down, and think about it for a minute.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Look at his hands, man. They're burned.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAWYER: Back off, Jack. It's got nothing to do with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: Shut it!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HURLEY: Look, everybody chill out.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN:  당신도 나를 못 믿겠어?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: What'd he say?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 난 아니야.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL:  You said something to me?!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK:  Michael.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN:  난 아니야!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Say it again!?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: Michael, Michael.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: No, no, no. Say it again, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 내가 불 지른게 아니야!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK:  Michael.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 알았어? 어?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK:  Hey!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAWYER: Easy, Doc. One fight at a time.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAYID: He's right. This is between them.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 내가 갔을 땐 이미 불타고 있었어!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 불 끄려다가 내 손이 이렇게 된거야. 손을 좀 봐.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: Stop it!! Leave him alone.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: He didn't burn your raft.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 CHARLIE: You speak English?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HURLEY: Didn't see that coming.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JACK: You understood us? All this time? Why didn't you say anything?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN:  Your raft was already on fire when he arrived. He burned his hands trying to put it out.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Then why did he run?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN:  잘못하지 않았는데 왜 도망쳤냐고 이 사람이 물어보네요.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Exactly, that's what I thought.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: My husband is many things. But he is not a liar.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAWYER: You're going to lecture us about lying, Betty? From the look on his face, even your old man here didn't know you speak English. How do we know she's not covering for him?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE:  Because she's isn't! Why would he burn the raft?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: He's been after me since day one, everybody knows it! What if-
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Okay, it's personal, but why take it out on our best chance of getting off the Island? Why would any one of us block an attempt to get home? We're so intent on pointing the finger at one another that we're ignoring the simple undeniable truth that the problem isn't here, it's there!  They've attacked us, sabotaged us, abducted us, murdered us! Maybe it's time we stop blaming us and start worrying about them! We're not the only people on this Island and we all know it!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: He did not do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: I can't salvage a thing -- pontoons, the decking.  Fire burned up all the twine! Damn it!!  Damn it!! God!  I'm sorry, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: It's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: No. Come here. Come here. Look, we all have set-backs. I mean, God knows, man. It's just life, we'll start over.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: You're going to building another one?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: Yeah. A better one.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: Can I help?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 MICHAEL: No doubt you can help. Come on.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SUN: 지금 뭐 하는 거에요? 말 좀 해 봐요! 어딜 가게요? 해변으로 가게요? 우리 관계를 이런 식으로 정리하고 싶어요? 뗏목에 대해서... 왜 나한테 사실을 말해주지 않았죠? 대답하기 싫어요? 나한테 이러는 이유를 모르겠어. 내가 뭘 잘못했는데? 우리가 언제부터 이렇게 대화가 안 됐어요!   I was going to leave you! I was going to get away. But you made me change my mind. You made me think that you still loved me. 나... 처음부터 다시 시작하고 싶어. 여보... 우리 새롭게 시작해요, 네? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 FATHER: 진수야! 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 죄송해요, 아버지... 용서하세요. 아버지가... 부끄러웠어요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 FATHER:  괜찮다, 괜찮아.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 FATHER: 그래, 네 색시는 어떤 사람이야? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 아주 예쁘고, 똑똑하고... 고집 있는 친구에요. 요즘은... 대화도 없어요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 FATHER: 아니 왜 말을 안해? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 아버님에 대한 진실을... 그 애에게 직접 얘기할 수가 없어요. 진실을 알게 되면... 나보다 아버님을 더 미워할테니까요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 FATHER: 진수야, 지금은 살기 좋은 세상이다. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 제가 어떤 일을 저질렀는지 아버지는 모르실 거에요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 FATHER: 너는 내 아들이야. 니가 무슨 일을 하든 상관 없어. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 다시 시작하고 싶어요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 FATHER: 아니 그럼 왜 다시 못해? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 제가 하는 일이 좋지... 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 FATHER: 아니, 니 부인보다 더 중요한 게 있어? 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 장인 어른은 제게 시드니와 LA에 있는 더러운 거래자에게 시계를 전달하라고 하셨어요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 FATHER: 그러면 이번일을 마지막으로 네 장인한테 해주고... 진수야. 손 떼고, 다신 하지 마. 그리고 미국으로 가. 응? 그래서 너의 결혼을 살려라. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN: 그러기에는... 너무 늦었어. 
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SAYID: What was that for?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 SHANNON: Everyone gets a new life on this Island. I'd like to start now.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE:  Got yourself an opponent?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: Hurley owes me 83,000 dollars. I told him I'd give him a chance to win it back.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: It's been awhile since you and I played. I don't have 83,000 dollars.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: That's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Where's your pop?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: Down at the beach, I think. I'm not allowed to leave the caves after dark. You have a dad?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Everyone's got a dad.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: Is he cool?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: No. No, he's not.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT:  Yes!
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Good for you. Hey, you mind if I ask you something?
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: Sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: Why did you burn the raft, Walt? Don't worry, I'm not going to tell. You must've had a really good reason.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 WALT: I don't want to move anymore. I've been moving places my whole life. I like it here.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 LOCKE: I like it here, too.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 JIN:  Boat.
Lost.Season01.Episode17 HURLEY: Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JIN: 고정시키게 좀 조여줘요.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Hold on a second, you want what now?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: You want to make snowballs?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MICHAEL: He wants you to hold the bamboo tighter... I think.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK:  Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MICHAEL: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: How's it coming?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MICHAEL: It's coming.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: As long as nobody sabotages this one, as well, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MICHAEL: I've got people standing guard 24-7. Nobody gets near this with or without intent to burn. Hey, listen, I was thinking, chances of a passing ship spotting this raft out there are pretty slim. We could use something to send out a distress call to any ships that might be close, like an SOS.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Okay, well, look I'll ask Sayid, but even if he can make something like that he's not going to have anything to power it with.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Didn't Sayid say that crazy French chick has batteries?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: Absolutely not.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: I'm not asking you to go. I'll do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: No, you won't.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Dude, we just trying to-
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: Do you really think she would give up something she needs for survival to a total stranger?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: All I'm asking is for you to tell me how to find her. That's it.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: I was brought unconscious to her camp. When I escaped I was disoriented. I don't know how to find her.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Don't know, dude? Or don't want to?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Sayid, look, you've got her maps and her papers. Now you thought that they were pointing to something.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: Well, I was wrong.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Well, maybe they're pointing to her?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: Look! I don't even know what these papers mean. For all I know they could be the ravings of her disturbed mind - song lyrics mixed with equations.  If this map is pointing to her, then you should know she resides here, in this area. She gave it a name: Territoire Fonce, Shannon translated it. It means dark territory. Does that sound like a place you'd like to visit?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: So, you won't help?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: I didn't say that.  I'll build a distress beacon, but I suggest you find another power source. There must be something in the cockpit.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: We're not going in the cockpit.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: What are you doing in there?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Uno momento, Mama, just checking something out.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: I hope you're not watching those g-string mujeres again.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Look, mom, we've talked about this. You want me living here -- you've got to respect my privacy. And no, I'm not.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: Look at you. It's Saturday night. A grown up man sitting at home watching TV. You should go out, try to find yourself a nice woman.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Yeah, I'll get right on that.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: At least try eating better. You're gaining weight again.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARY JO: -- with mega number 42. And that makes tonight's mega-lotto-jackpot 4 8 15 16 23  With the mega number 42. Whoever has those numbers has won, or will share, in a near record jackpot.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOTTO OFFICIAL: That's right Mary-Jo because this is the 16th week without a winner.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Hi. You awake?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: I was just wondering that myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: So, that French lady, she wrote this stuff, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: Hurley, it's the middle of the night. What do you want?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Nothing. Couldn't sleep, then I got curious. You and Shannon, you guys have been trying to figure out some of this stuff and I was wondering what, you know, you guys figured out about this stuff.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: What stuff?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I don't know. Look, take these numbers she wrote down a bunch of times - got any idea what it means?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: I thought at one time they might be coordinates of some kind.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Coordinates, yeah. When you first found her, the French chick, you said you saw a wire or something on the beach? And you followed it, and it led you to her?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: No, it led me to a trap she set.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Her place is probably close, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: Why are you suddenly so interested in Rousseau?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I'm not -- just, you know, making conversation, dude. Sorry if it's a bad time. Goodnight.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Yeah, you.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 REPORTER #1: How'd you come up with the winning numbers, any significance?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Oh, they just, uh, sort of came to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 REPORTER #2: Why don't you introduce your family.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Oh yeah, okay, um, this -- this patch of beauty is my mom, Carmen. Come here, mom. And this is my brother, Diego and his wife, Lisa.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DIEGO: Woo! We're rich!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Nice, dude. Ignore him, he's an idiot. And, uh, oh, you've got to know this guy. This is the greatest guy I know, my, my, my grandpa Tito. He's worked 3 jobs for -- how long has it been now?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 TITO: 52 years.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: 52 years. 70 years old, and the closest thing he's had to a vacation is when they put a pacemaker in him 4 years ago. So the first thing I'm going to do with the money is, uh, finally give him the rest that he's earned. That's really what it's all about for me, to be able to do things for the people I care about, because I really put my family through a lot recently, and, um, well, this way I can make it up to them. You know, maybe even buy my mom a new house. And uh,  maybe after my grandpa comes back from his cruise we can, you know --  do some things that we always wanted to do.  Grandpa?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE:  Hey, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: What, I'm not doing anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: I'm just saying good morning.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Oh, right. Morning. Sorry, I was just, uh...
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: You going somewhere?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Me? No. Well, yeah. Just thought I might take a walk. Uh, maybe scope out some new fishing area.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Oh, hang on, I'll come with.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: That's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: No, I could use a little bit of the fresh wide open.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Dude, I could really use some alone time right now.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I'm a big guy, I get dehydrated easy.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Yeah. Yeah, okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE:  Claire, you got a second?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Uh, yeah, sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: I was wondering if you were free to help me with a little project.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Me?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: Yeah. I'm building something and I could use an extra pair of hands.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: I'm nearly nine months pregnant, I can barely waddle on the beach.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: Could you hold a saw?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Um, yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: Can you move your hand back and forth, like this? 
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Possibly.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: You're perfect.  Come on.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Okay. So, what exactly are we building?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: Where is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Where's what?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: The map. I told you, it won't help you find her.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Whoa, slow down. I don't have the map.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: What makes this worse is that you don't even do your own dirty work. You get Hurley to do it for you.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Wait a minute -- Hurley?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: He was in my tent last night, quizzing me about Rousseau, about numbers she wrote -- how I came to find her.  You don't know anything about this, do you?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK:  Charlie, you seen Hurley?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: A couple of hours ago, he was setting out for a walk. Acting like a loon, I might say.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: My god, he's going after her.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SHANNON: When are you going to be back?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: If we can catch up to him, before nightfall. Why? You worried about me?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SHANNON: So what if I am?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK:  Sayid, you ready?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID:  I'll be fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: You turn that noise down.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY:  Uh, sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: Where are you taking me? You know very well I don't like surprises.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: You're going to like this one, ma. I mean, after everything you've been through? Like grandpa --  And then at the funeral, Father Aguillar getting struck by lightening? Man, that was a freak storm. And Diego moving back home after Lisa left him for that . . . waitress?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: Don't mention that whore to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I'm just saying you deserve something good to happen. You know, ever since I won the lottery it's like we've had nothing but bad luck. Like, I don't know, like the money's cursed or something.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN:  That's blasphemy. You know very well we're Catholic. We don't believe in curses.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Jeez, ma, I'm just talking. Okay, we're almost there. Here, put this on.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: Why do I have to wear this?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Give me your hand. Careful.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: No, no, you be careful.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: You're stepping down.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: I can't see anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Okay, now take off your blindfold. And get a look  at your new dream house.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: Ow, my ankle!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I said take off your blindfold.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: Why did you make me put that in the first place?! Hugo, do I smell smoke?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Oh, crap. Hang on mom, I've got to call 911.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CARMEN: You tell them I broke my ankle.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 COP: Drop the phone, move away from the vehicle!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Oh, no, no, no. It's the house.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 COP: Do it, now! Turn around.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: No such thing as curses, huh, ma?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 COP: You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Yo! French chick!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 KEN HALPERIN: I would think you'd be happy. Every one of your stocks is up. Your interest in orange futures skyrocketed after those tropical storms hit Florida. And, you are now the majority shareholder for a box company in Tustin.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: A box company?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 KEN: Mmhmm. They make boxes, lucrative business. Everybody needs boxes. Which reminds me, your sneaker factory in Canada . . .
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I have a sneaker factory in Canada?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 KEN: Well, not any more. It was destroyed in a fire last month.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Of course it was.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 KEN: You might have read about it -- eight something people died. But, the good news is we over-insured it. It's going to yield you a windfall of cash. And, when we add in the generous settlement from the LAPD for your false arrest you've almost doubled your net worth in a few short months. I still can't imagine how the police mistook you for a drug dealer.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Bad luck.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 KEN: Hugo, you are not the first lottery winner to believe the money's brought them nothing but trouble. It's all in your head.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: What, you don't believe in jinxes? You know, curses?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 KEN: I'm an accountant, I believe in numbers. Hey, where'd you get them, anyway?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 KEN: The winning numbers. What'd you use, somebody's birthday, phone number?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: No, it's nothing, it's something that I . . .
Lost.Season01.Episode18 KEN: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: That's it. It's not the money, it's the numbers. The numbers are cursed. Dude, don't look at me like that, I'm not crazy. This is real.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 KEN: Come on, Hugo, listen to yourself. "The numbers are cursed." You know there is no such thing as a-
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAWYER: You want to hit that a little harder?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MICHAEL: I'm sorry. Is my building a raft to get us rescued bothering you?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAWYER: At the moment, yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 WALT: Why aren't you helping?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAWYER: I am helping, Short Round. I'm keeping watch for arsonists.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MICHAEL: Walt's got a point. You could pitch in, seeing as how you already bought your ticket.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JIN: 내가 밤새도록 묶어놨는데!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MICHAEL: Hey, did you tie this like I told you?! If you tied this like I told you the thing would still be together! What's the matter with you man?! What is your problem?!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SUN: He's never going to speak to me again.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 KATE: He just needs time.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SUN: I humiliated him. When the raft sails, do you think he's going to leave with them?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 KATE: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID:  Don't move!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Hey, what are you guys...
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: I said do not move. You're standing on a pressure trigger. If you take your weight off it, it will release that.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY:  Oh, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: We need to find something to replace his weight with the trigger.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Replace his weight? How are we going to do that?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Hey!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: Don't move!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Hey, everybody, just calm down.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Can I drop the wire?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Maybe if I find a rock or something?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: A big one.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I'm dropping the wire.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Hurley, no!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY:  I can make it.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Hurley, don't move!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: No!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I can get out of the way, I'm spry.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Oi!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Hurley, stay put.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Oi! No, wait!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: No, Hurley, Hurley! Don't even...
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Hurley, what the bloody hell's wrong with you?!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Nothing.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: What are you doing out here, man?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I came to get a battery.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Hurley, seriously, what's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Nada. You guys coming?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: You all want to go? Fine. But perhaps I should take the lead.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Excellent notion.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Lenny. His name is Lenny, or Leonard.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 NURSE: But you don't know his last name.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Look, I just need to talk to him for five minutes.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 NURSE: I'm sorry, but if you can't tell me the patient's name, sir, I can't very well look it up.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: How many Leonards are here? Can't you just type in Leonard? I mean, the guy's been here for, like, ever. He knows me.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 NURSE: Our records are private, sir. If any . . .
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY:  Dude! Do not do that right now! Leave the bulb for another time, man!  five minutes! All I need is five minutes!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DR. CURTIS: Hugo?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Oh, hey, Doc.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DR. CURTIS: It's good to see you. What are you doing back here?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Uh...
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DR. CURTIS: I don't remember you and Leonard being that close, Hugo.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Yeah, well, we hung.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DR. CURTIS: I'll leave you gentleman to it then. Good luck, Hugo.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LENNY: 
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HUGO: Hi, Lenny. Remember me? Hugo. Hurley. Well I was just, you know, in the neighborhood, and uh -- look, Lenny, I've got to know, what do the numbers mean?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LENNY: 4 8 15 16 23 42. 4 8 15 16 23 42 . . .
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: C'mon, Lenny, give me something. Anything. Where'd you get the numbers? Is that why you're here, Lenny? Is it because of the numbers? Did they do something to you? Because I think they did something to me. I think they turned me into a jinx -- bad news to everyone around me. And when I tell people I think I'm the cause they, they, they look at me like I'm nuts. They don't believe me. But I know, ever since I won the lottery with those numbers.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LENNY: You used those numbers to play the lottery?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Uh, -- yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LENNY: Well, you shouldn't have done that. You've opened the box!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I what?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LENNY: Ah, you shouldn't have used those numbers!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Why not?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LENNY: It doesn't stop! You've got to get away from those numbers! You've got to get far, far away!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 ORDERLY: All right, hey, hold on. Lenny, Lenny. Calm down. Lenny.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LENNY: Do you hear me?!? No, don't you understand?!? You've got to get away from it or it won't stop!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 ORDERLY: Try and calm down.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Wait a second, I need some answers.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 ORDERLY: Sir, you need to step away.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Those numbers, where'd you get them?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LENNY:  Sam Toomey! He heard them!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Who's Sam Toomey?!?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LENNY: He heard them in Kalgoorlie! It's a town where he used to work!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: It's a town where?!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LENNY: In Australia! Oh, God!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: It stops here. It goes into the ground. This poses somewhat of a problem.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE:  Guys? You should come see this.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Whoa.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: You never mentioned anything about a bridge.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: I never saw this before.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: There's no way she could have built this all by herself.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: No, but her team could have.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Or Ethan's team.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Hurley, what are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Relax, I'm just going to check it out. You guys should stay here.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Hurley, get back here!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Dudes, chill.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Hey, if he can do it...
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Charlie!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Dude, you okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: I'm okay. Woo!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Alright, you two stay put right there! We're going to find a way around and we'll meet you there!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Nah, screw that! You guys stay! There's a path right here, Charlie and me-
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Hurley, will you shut up and listen to Jack?!? He said stay put! You're acting like a bloody lunatic!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARTHA: If this weren't the middle of nowhere, I'd say you were lost.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Hi, is this Sam Toomey's house?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARTHA: It is. I'm his wife.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Is he around, because I'd kind of like to talk to him.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARTHA: I'd like that, too. But Sam's been dead for four years.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Your husband worked with a guy I know, Leonard Sims.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARTHA: That's right, they served together in the U.S. Navy. How is Leonard? Still in the service?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Uh, he's, um, retired. Anyway, he told me about Sam hearing something.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARTHA: You're talking about the numbers.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Yes, the numbers, exactly. Do you know anything about them?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARTHA: Sam and Leonard were stationed at a listening post monitoring long wave transmissions out of the Pacific. Boring job. Sam hated it, nothing to do but listen to static night after night. Until one night, about 16 years ago, there's something in the static, a voice comes through, a voice repeating those numbers over and over again.  A couple of days later we're at the fair in Kalgoorlie and some wally there has got this jar, must have been big as a pony, and it's filled to the rim with beans. Fella's offering 50 grand to anyone able to guess how many beans are in that jar, within 10.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Sam used the numbers?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARTHA: Yep, the answer was exact. To the bean. Men had been running the same scam for 40 years and nobody had ever come close. So we won the money. On the way home a pick-up truck blows a tire on the highway, hits us head on. Lost my leg that night.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: What about Sam?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARTHA: Barely a scratch. Most people would consider themselves lucky, but not him. He was never the same after that. He started keeping a record. Anything terrible that happened to anyone around us, he believed it was all because he used those numbers. He moved us out here in the middle of nowhere hoping it would stop.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Did it? Did he ever find a way to make it stop?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARTHA: Yep. He put a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. What is it you're looking for Mr. Reyes?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I used them, the numbers, to win the lottery. And now I think I'm under the same curse.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARTHA: Curse? There's no curse.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: But you just told me...
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARTHA: You think I'd still have my leg if Sam hadn't have picked the right number of beans?! You think that floods wouldn't have happened?! That homes wouldn't have burned down?! That people wouldn't have died?!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Well, yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 MARTHA: You make your own luck, Mr. Reyes. Don't blame it on the damn numbers. You're looking for an excuse that doesn't exist.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: It's a trap, right? For catching animals?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: Pass me that cup please.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Ugh, what's this gunk?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: Glue.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Where'd you find glue?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: I made it out of rendered animal fat.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: You made glue? Wow. Then you should have one of those shows where you fix up houses for people.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: I don't think so.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Thanks, for this -- giving me something to do. I'm tired of trying to remember what happened to me out there.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: How's that coming? Your memory?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Bits and pieces here and there. Nothing that makes any real sense.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: Well, maybe I can help. I'm good at putting bits and pieces together.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: This is familiar, this area. We're close.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: How do you know? I thought she lived underground?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: What the hell was that?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Hell of a security system. Somebody trips a wire and the whole place blows up?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: There's nothing here.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Batteries?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: Nothing.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: I don't get it.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: She knew. She knew that one day I'd come back and bring others. So she abandoned this place, booby-trapped it, and moved on.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Moved on where?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Jack! Sayid!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Do you even know where we're going?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: The blast sounded like it came from this way. I think.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: You don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Dude, what do you want from me?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: What do I want? I want to know what we're doing in the middle of nowhere? And don't tell me it's because of some stinking batteries. One minute you're happy-go-lucky, good time Hurley and the next you're Colonel-bloody-Kurtz. It just doesn't make any sense. It's not you.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Dude, you don't know me.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Well, all this time on the Island, you've told me nothing about yourself.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: We've all got personal stuff, dude.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Don't change the subject. We're lost out here. Jack and Sayid could be hurt, if not blown to bits, all because you're acting like some bloody nutter.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I am not crazy. I've got my reasons for every-
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: I think I have a right to know.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Okay, alright, you want to know?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Yep.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: About a year ago...
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Is someone shooting at us?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: You must be the French chick.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DANIELLE: Who are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Hurley. I, uh -- Sayid? That guy you tortured, he...
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DANIELLE: You were on the plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Look, I came here to find --  oh, easy, easy, easy. I'm just getting your notes. Please, tell me why you wrote this. What do these numbers mean? Please.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DANIELLE: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: What? You don't know? Okay, that thing in the woods, maybe it's a monster, maybe it's a pissed off giraffe, I don't know! The fact that no one is even looking for us, yeah, that's weird, but I just go along with it because I'm along for the ride, good old fun time Hurley! Well guess what? Now, I want some friggin' answers!
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DANIELLE:  Our ship picked up a transmission -- a voice repeating those numbers. We changed course to investigate. After we shipwrecked my team continued to search for the transmission source. It was weeks before we found the radio tower.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: There's a radio tower on this Island?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DANIELLE: Yes, up by the Black Rock. Some of us continued to search for the meaning of those numbers while we waited for rescue. But then the sickness came. When my team was gone, I went back up to the tower and changed the transmission.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: The distress signal we heard?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DANIELLE: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: But the numbers -- did you ever find out anything about them? Do you know where they got their power?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DANIELLE: Power?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: They bring bad stuff to everyone around you. They're cursed. You know that, right? The numbers, they're cursed.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 DANIELLE: The numbers are what brought me here. As it appears they brought you. Since that time I've lost everything, everyone I cared about. So yes, I suppose you're right. They are cursed.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Thank you. Thank you. You have no idea how long I've been waiting for someone to agree with me. Thank you. Oh god, thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: We need to find Hurley and Charlie and get out of this jungle. I just hate that we're going home empty handed.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Hey, hey, someone shot at us, Hurley and me. We were looking for you when...
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: Rousseau.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: Where's Hurley?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: I don't know. He was right behind me and then he just, he just wasn't.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 SAYID: I'll go and find him.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 JACK: No, no. We'll all go.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY:  Go where?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Hurley, what the hell happened to you?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY:  Need a battery?  She says, hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: You think of a name yet?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: For the baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Haven't really thought about it. I was going to give it away, you know, for adoption.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: That must have been a difficult decision.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Yeah, well, it doesn't matter now. It's my birthday today.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: Why haven't you told anyone?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: I'm pregnant, single, and on an Island in the middle of nowhere. It doesn't really matter that it's my birthday, does it?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: I guess not. At least your birthdays will be close together, you and your baby, and that's good luck.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Yeah, you think?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: Yeah, I do.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: You believe in that? Luck?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: I believe in a lot of things.  That should do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Okay, I give up. What is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: It's a cradle.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 LOCKE: Happy birthday, Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CLAIRE: Thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: I know food's scarce, but your shirt?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: When you find a laundromat, let me know.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Back in the jungle before we became target practice you were going to tell me what inspired this little quest.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: I think the plane crash might have been my fault.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Don't be daft, how could you possibly...
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Hey, before we came here a lot of bad stuff used to happen whenever I was around.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: What do you mean, like bad luck?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Yeah, that's -- that would be kind of a mellow way of describing it.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Hurley, bad things happen, planes crash, people die.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Dude, you gotta let me finish.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: You think you're the only person with baggage? You know what I was doing when the plane went down? I was snorting heroin in the toilet. I was such a junkie I couldn't even take a plane ride with out having a fix. I suppose that was your fault, as well? -- So how about it?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: I just told you the biggest secret of my life. I thought you'd want to reciprocate.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Okay. Back home I'm worth 156 million dollars.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: Fine. Don't tell me.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 HURLEY: Dude.
Lost.Season01.Episode18 CHARLIE: I bare my soul, and all I get is bloody jokes!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KID: What's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: A game. It's my favorite game, actually. I used to play it with my brother. It's called Mouse Trap.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KID: How do you play?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Well, you start with all these parts off the board. And then, one by one, you build the trap - shoe, bucket, tub - piece by piece it all comes together. And then you wait 'til your opponent lands here on the old cheese wheel. And then if you set it up just right, you spring the trap. Go ahead, kiddo.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: May I help you, ma'am?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EMILY: Yes, um, could you tell me where the footballs are?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Aisle 8 for regulation, aisle 15 for Nerf.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EMILY: Oh, yes, thank you. Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: You want my opinion?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Boone, you've got to have some faith.  All we've got to do is break the glass, and then we're in. The trebuchet delivers a half a ton of force.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Why do they call it a trebuchet? It looks like a catapult.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: It's called a trebuchet, Boone, because it's a trebuchet.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: I don't get you, man. One minute you're quoting Nietzsche, now all of the sudden you're an engineer. I don't think I can spell trebuchet.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: There's a 't' on the end.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: I'm serious, John. We've been coming out here everyday for 2 weeks—you never talk about yourself. Everybody's got a story.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: My story would bore you.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: 3, 2, 1.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  This was supposed to work. This was supposed to work!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: John. Your leg, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Are you okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  Yeah, I'm fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: The trebuchet—why didn't it work?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: It didn't work because it wasn't strong enough.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: I don't think that glass is going to break, man. Whatever it's made out of...
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Everything breaks if you apply the right force.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: So, we're just going to build another one of your inventions, hope it works this time.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: That's right.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What if it doesn't?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Then the Island will tell us what to do.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I should get back there -- salvage those pieces.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Your leg okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: It's fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 MAN: Hi John.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 MAN: You alright, John?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Hey, hey, hey. Why are you following me?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EMILY: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Who are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EMILY: I'm your mother.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Look, miss, I don't know why you think I'm your son, or how you found me, but...
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EMILY: You're adopted, aren't you?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: No. No, I was raised in a foster home. Well, several foster homes, actually. Look, I don't mean to be rude -- what do you want from me?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EMILY: I want to tell you that you're special, very special. You're part of a design. You do realize that, don't you? That our meeting, me finding you, this is a sign of things to come. Great things.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: My father, is he still alive?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EMILY: Still alive? Oh, John, don't you understand? You don't have a father. You were immaculately conceived.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER:  Which one?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SUN: That one.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: You're sure? Because this is the one I've been using and nothing's happening.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SUN: I'm sorry it's not helping.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE:  What's not helping?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Nothing.  Thanks, anyway. Nice garden. 
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: What was that all about?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SUN: He has headaches.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: Doesn't he have, like, a truckload of aspirin stashed away somewhere?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SUN: He says aspirin didn't help.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: Can I ask you a question? Say you're having bad headaches everyday...
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: You okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: Yeah, fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: So, who are we talking about then, Kate?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Uh-huh.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: I just think there might be something really wrong with him.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: And what does he think?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: He says he's fine, but...
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Then he's fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: Yeah, well, he could be playing it down. There could be some...
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Look, Kate, I'd like nothing more than to check the guy out and make sure he's okay. But we both know all I'm going to get for my trouble is a snappy one-liner. And if I'm real lucky, a brand new nickname. I'm just over it.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: You're late.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Late for what?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Late for work.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: I think I'm done working, John.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I'm sorry, what?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: It's useless. You can't open that thing up. You say you can but you can't.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: No, don't tell me what I can't do.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Don't you get it? It's a dead end. You're not getting in.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: That's impossible. We didn't find this by accident. We're supposed to...
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Oh, we're supposed to. We're supposed to find this, right? We're supposed to open it, right? Then tell me something, John, if we're supposed to open it, then why the hell haven't we opened it yet?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: The Island will send us a sign.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE:  The Island will send us a sign.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: All that's happening now is our faith is being tested - our commitment! But we will open it! The Island will show us how!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What kind of sign will the Island send us? Huh, John?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  Did you see that? Boone?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE:  Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs. Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: No, no, no, please.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE:  Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  Don't take it back.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  Boone, wake up.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Huh.  What time is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  It's morning, c'mon.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Okay, okay, I'm up, I'm up. What is going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: C'mon, let's go.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 FRAINEY: Emily Annabeth Locke in 10,000 words or less.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  So, she's my mother.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 FRAINEY: I lifted some hairs from her car and matched them with your DNA samples. It's 99% certain.  She was institutionalized - a few times.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: What for?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 FRAINEY: Nothing criminal or violent. It's a type of schizophrenia. Apparently, if she stays on her meds, she's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  What about my father?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 FRAINEY: Here's the thing -- your mother sought you out, so she's fair game. But this guy—maybe he doesn't even know you exist. I've done this enough times to know this stuff isn't meant to be, even though it may feel that way. But this probably won't have a happy ending. So, do you want it, or not?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I want it.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EDDIE:  Your name is?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: John, John Locke. I'm Anthony Cooper's son.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EDDIE: Mr. Cooper doesn't have a son.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Tell him I don't want anything. My mother is Emily Locke. Please.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EDDIE: Just a minute.  Yeah, Mr. Cooper, I've got John Locke here -- says he's your son. Yes, sir.  Well, you can go on in, sir.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: Well, this is -- awkward.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Thank you for seeing me, sir. I'm, uh, John.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: Something tells me I'm going to want a drink for this. You want a drink?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Um, yeah, alright, great.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: Scotch okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Yeah, that's, um, thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: So who found who?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I'm sorry, sir?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: Emily, your mother, did she find you or did you find her?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: She found me.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: How did she look?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Alright, I guess.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: Did she say anything about me?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: She said that I didn't have a father -- that I was immaculately conceived.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER:  Really? Well, I guess that makes me god, huh? I didn't even know you existed until a year after you were born. She told me she wasn't even going to have the baby, you, at all. Then she drops off the face of the planet. When she turns up again, she's asking for money, telling me she put you up for adoption. You going to drink that, or what?  You have a family of your own?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: No, sir.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: Me neither. I tried it a couple of times, didn't take. Do you hunt?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  No, no.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: You're not one of those animal rights nut jobs, are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: No. No, sir.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: What are you doing this Sunday?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Nothin'.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: You want to go hunting?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Um, well, I'd like that. Yeah, I'd like that very much.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I had a dream last night. I asked for a sign and then I saw a plane crash, a Beechcraft  right out there. It was a dream, but it was the most real thing I've ever experienced. I know where to go now.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Go for what?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: To find what we need to open this bastard up.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Have you been using that wacky paste stuff that made me see my sister get eaten?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  No, no.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Because, John, I've got to tell you -- signs and dreams and...
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Who's Theresa?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Theresa falls up the stairs. Theresa falls down the stairs. You were saying that in the dream.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: How would you know about that?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I don't know, Boone, but we're supposed to go to this place. We're supposed to find that plane. Will you come with me?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: I was going to ask you how this was going, but it's coming together fast.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 MICHAEL: The fire wasn't a total loss. We learned a few things from building the first one which is saving us from trial and error. Now it's just  trial.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JIN: 빨리 묶어서 마무리 하자고요! 고쳐야 돼.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JIN: 어두워지기 전에!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 MICHAEL: Yeah, man, I know, now, now, now.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: You picking up on a little Korean there, Michael?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm pretty sure I know how to say: faster and idiot.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: I hear you're having trouble with your head.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: What, now she got you making house calls?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: You're sensitive to the light, too, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: You know what? I'm sensitive to you...
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK:  Alright, we'll see you.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Doc? Sensitivity to the light -- that bad?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Depends.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: On what?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: On what's causing your headaches.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: It's not like it's a tumor, or something.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: What makes you think it's a tumor?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: I don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Great. Okay, then.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: My uncle. He died of a brain tumor.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: That run in a family? Tumors?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: What type of tumor was it?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: The type that kills you.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Do you smell anything funny? Brain tumors bring on phantom smells, maybe like something burning.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Just headaches.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Well, I'm sure you're fine then. Look, if this is worrying you, there's a couple of tests that I could do.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Sorry, Doc, sounds fun, but my insurance ran out.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK:  Insurance ran out. That -- that's a good one.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: I could have mentioned her name out by the hatch one day.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Who?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Theresa. Maybe I was talking to myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  Maybe, but you didn't.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: So, in this dream you saw a plane crash, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Okay, the fact that we were all just in a plane crash, you didn't think for one second-
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: John, you okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  I'm fine! 
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What is wrong with your leg?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I'm fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Someone from camp hiked all the way out here?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Nope.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Where do you think it came from?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  Him.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Mornin', Eddie.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EDDIE: Mornin', Mr. Locke. You gentlemen going to get some birds again?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I sure hope so.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Anthony?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: You weren't supposed to be here 'til 12.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I thought you said 11. What is this?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: It's a dialysis machine. My kidney's failing. Damn doctors say I need a transplant.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: When?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: Tomorrow if it were up to me. I'm on the donor list, but I'm an old man and it's a long list.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: How, how long...
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: John, the dialysis will be fine for a while. I didn't tell you for this exact reason. I'm not going to let this spoil what's going to be a fantastic day, and neither should you. So, I'll get done here and we'll have a nice lunch and go shoot some birds.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: He's a priest. How long do you think he's been dead?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Normally clothing would completely decompose within 2 years, but this is high quality polyester, could be 2 years, could be 10.  Gold teeth, obviously well off.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What kind of money is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Nigerian naira.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What is a Nigerian priest doing on an Island in the South Pacific?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  I'm not so sure he's a priest.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: You want to keep it down?!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE:  That's it, get up.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: Get up. You're going to Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Do I get a lollipop?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: When did the headaches start?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: A few days ago, a week maybe.  Do you have to be here?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Do you have them when you wake up in the morning?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Usually they hit me in the middle of the day. What the hell are you doing with that thing?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Checking to see how your pupils respond to changing stimuli.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: What's that -- that nod?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: Would you just let him do his thing?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: I'm letting him, but I want to know what the hell he thinks I-
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: I think you should just shut up and relax.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Have you ever had a blood transfusion?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: What? No.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Taken pills for malaria?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Nope.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Have you ever had sex with a prostitute?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: What the hell has that got to do with anything?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Is that a yes?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER:  Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Have you ever contracted a sexually transmitted disease?  I'm going to take that as another yes. When was the last outbreak?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Go to hell, Doc. 
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: I know he deserved it, but...
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: He needs glasses.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What's going on, John?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Nothing.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: You can barely walk, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: It's the wound from the shrapnel.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: That's your right leg, John. What's wrong with your left?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  I'm fine, now stop asking me.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: That's it. Let's go back.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I'm fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: No, you're not! Let me get you back to Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Jack wouldn't know the first thing about what's wrong with me.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: John, we've got to...
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: No, no.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What is wrong with you? Are you crazy?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I was in a wheelchair.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Paralyzed for 4 years. The plane, our plane, I was in that chair when we took off. But not after we crashed.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Why were you in a wheelchair?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: It doesn't matter anymore. But, but, this Island, it changed me. It made me whole. Now it's trying to take it back and I don't know why. But it wants me to follow what I saw.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I know it sounds crazy. 4 weeks ago I wouldn't have believed it myself. But you and I are here for a reason. There's something that we were meant to find, something that's going to help us get into the hatch. I know it. But we've got to keep going.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Okay. Can you move your legs?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Just help me up, son.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: These doves fly a lot faster than you think. So you've got to really lead them. If you have to drop it in high cover...
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Got him.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: Yeah, you did. Good shot, son. John, your mother, she may be a little crazy, but at least she brought us together. Thank god it happened now, while we still have time. Let's find your bird.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: She was my nanny -- Theresa. She was my nanny. My mother wasn't around much. I needed someone to take it out on. My bedroom was at the top of this huge flight of stairs, and I would sit in bed all day calling her on the intercom. One day she took a bad step, broke her neck. I was six.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE:  Listen, what the hell is so funny?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  Look.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Is that the plane you saw?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: As best I can tell.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: You really saw it?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Yeah, I really saw it.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: How long do you think it's been there?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Doesn't matter. What's important is that we found it. What's important is what's inside it.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: What is inside of it, John?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: You're going to have to climb up there for us and find out.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: You can still change your mind.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Nah. They already shaved my back.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: I'm so thankful for you, John.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: This was meant to be.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 COOPER: See you on the other side, son.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: If you're looking for a stool sample, you can forget it.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: You've been reading a lot since we came to the Island.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Okay, so what?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: You, uh, you've got, uh, you've got hyperopia.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER:  Hyperopia? That's, uh, what is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: You're far-sighted.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Far-sighted?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK:  Yeah. It can develop later in life, especially when you add a new strain to the eyes like with reading.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Blurry.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Better or worse?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Worse.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Uh-uh, no way.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Sawyer, it's not a fashion show.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER: Har, har, very funny.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 HURLEY:  Dude, it looks like someone steam rolled Harry Potter.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 SAWYER:  You love this, don't you?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: You're welcome.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Hang on.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Boone?! Boone?!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: I'm fine!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Boone, what do you see?! Boone?!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Want to know what's in your damn plane, Locke?!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Here's your sign!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: They're drug smugglers, Locke. Heroin, that's all that's in here!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I don't understand. I don't understand.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Boone, Boone, get out!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE:  Hello. Hello. Anybody out there? Mayday, mayday.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Boone, there's no time! Get out now!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 RADIO VOICE: Is someone there?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Hello! Hello! Can you hear me?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 RADIO VOICE: Repeat your transmission, please.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 BOONE: Hello. We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815, please copy!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  Boone, get out!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 RADIO VOICE: We're the survivors of Oceanic flight 815.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  Get out now!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: So, did you know before or after you asked him about his latest outbreak?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Well, I'd answer that, Kate, but, you know, doctor-patient confidentiality.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 KATE: Of course. Thank you for helping him. I know it was probably the last thing you wanted to do.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: I didn't do it for him.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  Jack, help!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: No, no, no. Put him down up here. Alright, alright, that's it, easy. What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: There was an accident. Boone fell off a cliff out near the place we were hunting.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: Okay, I'm going to need some water, shirts, towels, anything that I can use to staunch the bleeding. Kate, now, please!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 JACK: John, tell me exactly what happened. John? Locke?! Locke?! Locke?!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 NURSE: I think what you did was so kind.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Where's my father?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 NURSE: Who?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: We had the transplant together.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 NURSE: I didn't know he was your father.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: We don't have the same last name. Where is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 NURSE: Mr. Cooper checked out this afternoon. He went back home. He's under private care.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: But, that doesn't make any... Why? Did he leave me a message?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 NURSE: No, not that I know of. You just relax, Mr. Locke. I'm going to get you some juice.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EMILY:  It was his idea. I'm sorry, John.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EMILY: I needed some money. He's always been good that way. Your father's always been generous.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: You told me I didn't have a father.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EMILY: Well, he said that was the only way you would give it to him. It had to be your idea. He told me where to find you. He, he asked me to go see you. I wanted to see you.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE:  This can't be happening. This, this is a misunderstanding. This can't-this can't happen to me. He wouldn't do this to me.  He wouldn't do this to me!
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Eddie, Eddie open the gate.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EDDIE: Mr. Cooper's not seeing guests.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I'm not a guest.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EDDIE: I'm sorry, John.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: Eddie, open the gate.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EDDIE: I'm sorry, I'm going to need you to move your car.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I know you're watching me. You can't do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 EDDIE: John, please. Move your car.
Lost.Season01.Episode19 LOCKE: I've done everything you wanted me to do, so why did you do this to me?!
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: C'mon, out of the way! I need room. Steady.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Boone, can you hear me? It's okay, we've got you.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 HURLEY: What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: He fell down a cliff.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 HURLEY: But he was with Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Hold steady.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: Jack, his leg.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: I know. He's bleeding. Keep him steady, damn it. You've got to press harder than that, Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: I know. I'm trying.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Alright, slow now. Slow and gentle. Easy.  Sun, pair of scissors - second drawer in the cart. Second drawer! Diapers in the first drawer.  Sun's going to switch places with you. Sun, I need...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN:  Yes, I understand.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Hurley, grab me that first class seat from up there. Also, I need that mesh. We need to create some kind of sterile -- . Hurley, I swear to god, if you faint!
Lost.Season01.Episode20 HURLEY: No -- first class -- mesh - I'm cool. Lord in heaven.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK:  Get to the beach. Ransack Sawyer's stuff. I want his alcohol - rubbing, scotch.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Jack, what's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: His lung just collapsed. Okay.  Okay, okay, good Boone. Good, Boone, that's good. Good job. Alright, a little bit of tube in that and you're going to be just fine.  What are you still doing here? The alcohol, Kate! You want him to live -- get to the beach, now!
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MARC: Alright, damn it, just get the stupid clip-on, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: You know why they call it a tie? Because you've got to tie it.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MARC: You know why they call it a clip-on? Because you clip it -- on.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: You nervous, Silverman?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MARC: What the hell do I have to be nervous about?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: It's a big responsibility.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MARC: I can handle responsibility.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Maybe. But I know that you don't like to get up in front of crowds.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MARC: I'll be fine. After about 8 beers, I'll be fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: She'll bust you, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MARC: I'll brush my teeth.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: She'll bust you. You can still back out, Marc.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MARC: Nah, it's just a stupid speech. I'll make you proud.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 TUX SHOP OWNER: Okay, groom's turn.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MARC: You can still back out, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: Oh, it hurts.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: It's a closed fracture but I think I can set it.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: His chest, the wound. Can you -- sew him?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: He's lost a lot of blood. I wonder how far Locke had to carry him.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: I'm going to die.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK:  Boone, listen to me. Listen! You are not going to die. I'm going to fix this, okay? I am going to save you.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MICHAEL: You've got to flip it or it'll burn, Walt.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAWYER:  Hey, mamacita. You want some fish?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: No, thanks. I'm not really hungry.  How long do you think 'til it's ready?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MICHAEL: Maybe a week, maybe less. You okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE:  Yeah, I'm fine. Alright, I'll see you guys later.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAWYER: She likes me.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MICHAEL: Hey, Jin! Jin! Want some fish? Hey, take a break. Eat some fish.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAWYER: The man's got what I call an overzealous work ethic.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MICHAEL: Try obsession. He wants off this Island bad, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAWYER: Can't say I blame poor Kato. His lady speaks English all this time and he didn't have a clue? I'm surprised he didn't try to swim out of here. Hell, I would've.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE:  Sawyer, I need all your alcohol. Now!
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAWYER: How'd it happen?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Locke said that he fell off a cliff while they were out hunting boar.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAWYER: Boar they never seem to get.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Is that it? 
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAWYER: Afraid so. You need anything else? I could come with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Too many cooks already, but thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: He needs blood.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Blood. A transfusion.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: How will you do that?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: I don't know. I'll figure it out. After I set the leg.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: Let me.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: That's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: Let me. Get some air.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: How is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Don't know yet.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: What happened out there? Where's Locke? Do you think that...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: I don't know!
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: What, he just took off?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Yeah, Charlie. He just took off.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Where's Shannon?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Well, she's his sister. You don't think...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: I don't know where she is!
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MARC: And here she is, the future Mrs. Jack Shepard.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SARAH: Thank you. Wow, can I get another microphone? I think this one's been drinking. A little over two years ago, I blew a tire out -- flipped over the center divider into oncoming traffic, and was hit head-on by an SUV. My back was broken. They all said it was irreparable. And then there was Jack. And he promised he would fix me, because that's the kind of guy he is. Because you are the most committed man I have ever known -- because you fixed me, I will dance at our wedding. To Jack, my hero, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: Give him this -- for the pain.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: I think we're a little beyond herbal remedies here.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN:  It is not a remedy.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Will you hold his shoulders? Here we go.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Claire? What are you doing out here?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: Nothing. Just leave me alone, please.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Oh god, you're having a baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Claire, we need to get you back to camp.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: I'm fine. I just need to -- I just need to catch my breath.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: It's not okay. You're having your baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: No, I'm not, okay. It's just gas pains, it's fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: You're having contractions, Claire!
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: No! I'm bloody not. Can you just leave me alone?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: C'mon, I've got to get you to Jack. Please try to stand. Please.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: Look, I can't.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE:  Help! Somebody help!
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JIN:  오. 이런.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Jin, I need you to go to the caves and get Jack, okay, you understand? We need Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JIN: Jack. Doctor.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Yes. Get the doctor, please come here.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: Don't leave me.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Oh, no, no, honey. I won't. I'm not going anywhere, okay? I promise.  Jack, hurry.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Ask him again.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: He's in shock.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: That's why you need to ask him again.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: Boone, can you hear me? What is your blood type? Boone, please listen. What is your blood type?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Damn it.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: Maybe a smaller piece?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Veins are like a wet noodle -- first you have to find one, then you have to have a hollow needle sharp enough to actually pierce it. I've got bamboo. None of it actually even matters because I don't know his blood type, not to mention that his injuries-
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: A-negative.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Boone, what'd you say?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: Shannon, the plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK:  Did you hear A-negative? Get Charlie -- ask everyone you can find, everyone, what their blood type is. A negative, okay? And find his sister. Find Shannon.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SHANNON: Where are we going?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAYID: This way.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SHANNON: Oh, okay. Are you lost?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAYID: No, absolutely not. Those trees look really familiar. It's this way -- I think.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SHANNON: Did you just say: I think?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAYID: Surprise.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Damn it.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE:  I found an A.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Positive or negative?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: She doesn't know. I also found two B positives and one AB negative. At least, he thinks so.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Did you find any O negative?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Sun said A negative.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Where is she?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: We split up. I thought she'd be back here.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: You only asked 4 people?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: I asked the whole sodding camp -- no one knows their blood type. I don't know my bloody blood type.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK:  Did you find Shannon?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN : No. I was getting you this.  A hollow needle sharp enough to pierce a noodle.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: It's perfect.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Not to rain on your proverbial parade but I thought you said we needed someone who was A negative.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Or O negative.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Right, which judging by your tantrum, no one is.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Someone is.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: You? Why'd you make-
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: O negative is universal donor. It's in the ballpark, it's not a match. My blood could put him into anaphylactic shock -- stop his heart.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: You mean he'll die.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: He's not going to die.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SARAH:  Those girls are checking you out.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: You're in your PJs.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SARAH: Indeed I am.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Are they cute?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SARAH: Who?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: The girls that are checking me out.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SARAH: Mmm, one of them is kind of cute. The other one's just trashy. Heart and Soul?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: You got it.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SARAH: I'm taking the easy part.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Of course.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SARAH: You know you really don't have to do this if you don't want to.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: How do you know I haven't?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SARAH: Because you haven't.  Oh, sorry. It was a silly idea. I just -- I read too many bridal magazines. I think it rotted my brain.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Sarah, I want to. I'm going to. I just have to figure out the right way to say it.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SARAH: Just vows.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Just vows?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SARAH: Hey, he's going to come.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Yeah, I know.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SARAH: So, you stay down here as long as you need to. And when you're ready I'll be upstairs.  I cannot wait to marry you Jack Shepard.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JIN:  Jack, Jack, doctor, Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode20 HURLEY:  Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JIN: 그... 그... 해변가 근처 정글에 있는 그 임신한 여자... 지금 애 낳으려고 해요. Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Claire? What about Claire?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JIN: 지금 케이트하고 같이 있는데, 빨리 오래요.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: He says Claire's with Kate. She's in labor. Just off the beach.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Claire's having the baby?  Where, where?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JIN: 잭이 필요하대요.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN:  클레어는 괜찮아요?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JIN: 그런 것 같은데, 많이 아픈가봐.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: He says he thinks she's okay, but she's in pain.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Does he know how fast the contractions are coming?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN:  진통은 얼마마다 와요?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JIN: 어... 아마... 2분만에... 한번씩?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: Every 2 minutes.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Is she nauseous? Can she stand? Is there any bleeding? Did her water break?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN:  구토 증상은요? 움직일 수 있나요? 하혈은요? 양수가 터졌나요?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JIN: 양수가 터진지는 모르겠는데, 움직이지는 못할거야.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: No, none of that, but she can't move.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: We should go. What do we need -- towels, bandages, hot water? How do we take hot water?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: I'm sure you'll figure all that out, alright.  You tell Jin to take Charlie with him and go back to Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN:  당신은 찰리랑 함께 클레어한테 다시 가세요.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Uh, I know. That, that dilating thing -- how do I look out for that?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Charlie, listen to me. Okay, Charlie, look at me. Tell Kate to wait until the contractions are 60 seconds apart, you got that? Now, she's going to need to make sure that Claire pushes, but not too hard, not too fast -- just until the head is clear. And then, as hard as she can. When the baby is out make sure she clears it's nose and it's mouth.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Yeah, but, you'll be there by then, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: No, I'm not going anywhere. I need to stay here. Now, you tell Kate she's going to have to deliver this baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: They've stopped.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: That happens, I think.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: No, no, no, they're not coming anymore. I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: No. Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: No, no, no. I'm okay, really.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Claire, I don't think that you should be doing...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE:  What is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: I think your water just broke.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: No, no, no.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Yeah, no, no, I think you, okay...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: No, I can't have the baby now.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Just hold on...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: I can't have the baby now!
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Just hold on. Jack's coming. Claire, he's coming.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: I screwed myself up pretty bad, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: My leg, it hurts.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Don't try moving. Can you breathe okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: It fell on me.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: What fell?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: A plane. It was a plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Boone. Boone, Locke said you fell from a cliff.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: No -- it was. It fell -- the plane. It's because of the hatch. We found a hatch.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Boone, Boone, stay with me, man. Hey, stay with me.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: Locke said, John said, John said not to tell. About the hatch.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: What did Locke do? What hatch? What...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: Oh, my leg hurts.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Boone? Boone, hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: Shannon, Shannon, Shannon...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SHANNON: I need to tell you something.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAYID: Alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SHANNON: My brother, Boone. He's not really my brother. He's my step-brother. Our parents got married when we were, like, 8 and 10. He's kind of in love with me.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAYID: In love with you? And how do you feel towards him?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SHANNON: I'll always feel something for him. But am I in love with him in that way? No. Not at all. We're here for god knows how long, and so is Boone.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAYID: Maybe we should go back?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SHANNON: I don't want to go back.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAYID: Are you sure?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SHANNON: Yes. I just need to take it a little slow. Are you okay with that?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAYID: I had no expectations.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SHANNON: Right.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SAYID: Hopes, not expectations.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: Oh, god, that hurts.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Hello? Hey, Kate. Claire, is she okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Where's Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Couldn't come.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: What do you mean he couldn't come?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: He's pouring his own blood into Boone's arm right now.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Okay, okay. We'll just pick her up and bring her to him.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: No, Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: No, we have to take her to him before it's too late.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Look, Jack said you have to deliver the baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Now, he talked me through it...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: It's relatively simple.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: I can't do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Yes, you can. I have water. I have towels.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: You're not listening to me. I can't deliver this baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Well, somebody bloody has to.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JIN:  오래 걸리지 않을거에요. 안정을 취해봐요.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: You know I was out there for over a week -- days I can't remember. I mean, what if, what if they did something to the baby? I'm not ready for this. I'm not -- I'm so scared. I'm scared.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: I'm, I'm scared, too. But we're going to get through this together, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: C'mon, Boone.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: It's not working.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: The blood's not the problem. It's the leg. All the blood's pooling there -- compartment syndrome. He didn't get this injury from a fall. Something crushed his leg.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: You've given him enough.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK:  Hurley.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 HURLEY: Whoa, dude. You alright, man? You're looking kind of goth.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Where's Michael?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 HURLEY: The beach, I think.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: I need you to go get him for me, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 HURLEY: What for?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Just get him.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Hey, kiddo.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: How's the water?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Oh, it's fantastic.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Screaming kid next to me in first class. How does that happen, huh? What you got there?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Oh, Sarah wants us to write our own vows.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD:  'My hearts skips beats at the sound of your voice. My skin warms to the touch of your fingers. Where you go, I will go,' etc. etc. This is very nice.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Those aren't my vows. Those are hers. I stole them out of the room. Can't write mine.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Yeah, well, you're a doctor, not a writer.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Right.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Right. Sarah is a beautiful girl.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Hell, yeah, she is.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Do you love her?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Absolutely.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Then why are you sitting out here?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: What if I can't be the husband, or the father, that I want to be? What if I asked her because I saved her life? Should I marry her, dad?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Commitment is what makes you tick, Jack. The problem is you're just not good at letting go.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MICHAEL: You're saying Locke lied?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: He didn't fall. His leg was pinned under something -- something heavy.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MICHAEL: Okay, Jack, wait. The cargo container? We've got to do this? What about the axe?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: We can't use the axe.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: The right leg is filling with blood. If I don't stop it I won't be able to save him.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: You don't mean that-
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: The leg is dead.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: There's no other choice.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Claire, I think this is about the time you're supposed to start pushing, okay? So, push.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: And, don't hold your breath, honey. You won't be able to push if you -- Claire? Claire, what are you doing? Oh, no, no, no, Claire, you need to push, right now. Don't do this, Claire, okay? You can't stop this -- this is happening. Your baby is coming and I need your help.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: It's not going to want me.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: It knows I don't want it -- that I was going to give it away. Babies know that stuff.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Do you want this baby now? Hmm? Do you want it to be healthy and safe?  Okay, then the baby knows that, too. You are not alone in this. We are all here for you. This baby is all of ours, but I need you to push, okay? Okay? Alright. 1, 2, 3, push. Good. Good, push!
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CHARLIE: Yeah, right. Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK:  Let's go.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: On 3...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: 1, 2, 3...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SUN: Why are you doing this? He's bleeding inside. You're not helping him! You can't save him, Jack. You just can't!
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Don't tell me what I can't do! Okay, 1, 2, 3, go.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: You don't need to see this.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MICHAEL: If you need me, shout.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 SARAH: In sickness and in health, in good times and bad, I risk it all because I love you.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 MINISTER: Thank you, Sarah. Jack has also prepared his vows. Jack, if you would, please. Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: I didn't write any vows. I've been trying to for a month, but I couldn't. So I started to wonder why that was. And as time went on it only got worse -- because I'm, because I'm not good at letting go. Or maybe I'm afraid of what'll happen if I fail. But I know one thing. I would've never been able to write anything as beautiful as what you just said. And last night, Sarah, when you were talking about the accident -- you got it all wrong. I didn't fix you. You fixed me. I love you, Sarah, and I always will.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: Wait. Wait.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: I have to, if I don't...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: I'm all messed up inside. You know it.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: This is our best chance.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: There's no chance. Really. I mean, look where we are.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: I'm not going to let you give up.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: I know you made a promise. I'm letting you off the hook. Let me go, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: Don't be.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Breathe, c'mon breathe, breathe, okay, okay. Ready? I think it's close, c'mon. Go, go, go. That's really good. C'mon, I think it's close. Okay, good, good, good. I can see it. I can see the top of its head. I can see it. I can see it, okay. You're almost there. You're so close, you're so close. Ready, ready? C'mon, one more. Push, push, push, push, push! Oh, you have a little boy.  Your baby boy.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 CLAIRE: I have a son. I have a son.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 BOONE: Tell Shannon -- tell Shannon -- tell her...
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: It's a beautiful, healthy baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Want to talk about it?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: Talk about what?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: Boone died, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: He didn't die. He was murdered.
Lost.Season01.Episode20 KATE: What? Jack, where are you going?
Lost.Season01.Episode20 JACK: To find John Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Is there anything I can do for you? Sun said he wouldn't let Jack take his leg -- he didn't want him using up the antibiotics. She said he knew what was happening to him -- that he was brave.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT:  Heathrow airport authority reminds traveling passengers that safety regulations require...
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: Okay, Sayid, 18 hours in a holding cell should be enough. Let's get to it, shall we? I'm Melissa Cole from Central Intelligence, this is Robbie Hewitt from ASIS. We're here because you're going to do us a favor.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: A favor?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT HEWITT: Last week 300 pounds of C-4 explosives were stolen from an army base outside of Melbourne. The men responsible are members of a terrorist cell intent on disrupting the coalition presence in Iraq. 300 pounds of C-4 - I want it back.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID:  You're the CIA, plant a few bugs.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: Oh, we have. But you're going to get inside for us.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I am Iraqi. I am not a terrorist.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: We didn't snatch you up because you are a terrorist, Sayid. We snatched you up because you know one.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT HEWITT: Essam Tasir, your roommate at Cairo University. He's a member of the cell.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: And why should I care?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT HEWITT: You'd be saving lives.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I repeat, why should I care?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: Because we know where she is. 7 years since you left Iraq -- 6 months here, 3 months there -- always moving. There's only two reasons a man would do that, Sayid. Either he's running away from something, or looking for something.  Noor Abed-Jazeem.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Nobody calls her Noor.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: You want to know where she is? Then we're going to Sydney.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Kate? What are you doing out here?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Looking for you.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Well, you found me.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: You're walking in circles. You need to come back.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Not without Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: You haven't slept. You gave Boone your own blood.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Locke lied.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Well, now you're-
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: He lied, Kate. Boone did not fall off any cliff. His leg was crushed, and I based my medical treatment on his lie.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: People are scared and upset. They don't know what's going on. We need you to come back, Jack. Please.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Shannon? Do you want to say something?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I didn't know Boone very well, and for that I am sorry. On our 6th day here a woman named Joanna died. She drowned. And Boone was the first one into the water. I didn't know him, but I remember his courage. And I know he will be missed.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE:  It was my fault. We found a plane, a Beechcraft, in the jungle. It was lodged in the canopy so -- I would have gone up, but I -- my leg was hurt so he -- there was a radio inside and he thought he could -- look, his weight must have made the plane shift and it fell -- and -- it happened because he was trying to help us. He was a hero.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Where were you? Where were you? Where the hell were you, you son of a bitch?!  What did you do to him?!
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Hey, wait, wait, Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Where were you?! You left him to die! You lied to me! Where were you?!
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Jack, okay, it's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Where were you?! Where were you?!
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Jack! Jack, what's the matter? Are you okay? Are you okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAWYER: Get some water!
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Breathe. He's okay. Just breathe, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: He's lying.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: You're suffering from fatigue.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Locke told Boone not to tell.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Tell about what?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Something about a hatch. Locke's hiding something.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Jack, lis-
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Look, the man is hiding something.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Jack, listen to me. What we need is for the one doctor on this Island to get some sleep.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: I'm fine. I don't need it.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SUN: You need some rest. C'mon.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM:  Sayid! Sayid, it is you.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Essam.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: I see you haven't forgotten me.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Hardly.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: What are you doing in Sydney?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I've been traveling, and you?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: I live here -- almost a year now -- I'm a tree-cutter. I cut trees.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: It sounds like good, honest work.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: So much for my philosophy degree, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Whatever puts food on your table. How is Zahra?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: She died -- stray bomb while she was shopping for a dress.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I'm so sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: Listen, listen, we've got a lot of catching up to do. Why don't you come over?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I'd love to.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 YUSEF: Damn it. I'm out of ammo.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 HADDAD: Use the crowbar.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 YUSEF: That only works on the zombies, not the big bugs.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 HADDAD: Indeed.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: The 3 of you live here?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: Sydney's very expensive. This is the best we can afford.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 HADDAD: And what is it you do, Sayid?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: At the moment I'm at liberty.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: He's on holiday. You'll love the beaches here. There's something to be said for Australian women.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID:  I've had the misfortune of being landlocked for several years. The last beach I was at was Sharm-el Sheikh with you Essam -- remember, before our English exams?  I hear the beaches here are very nice, especially the women.  Perhaps we can go.  So tell me exactly what kind of trees do you cut?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 HADDAD: Who are you?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I was a communications officer.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: Sayid was Republican Guard. He knows things.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 HADDAD: Perhaps it's not happenstance that you and Essam met at the Mosque. Perhaps it is fate.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CLAIRE: It's okay. Look, I'm fine, really, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: You need rest, Claire. Sun, tell her.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SUN: In a hospital they would have you sleep. The nurses would take your baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CLAIRE: Yeah, but I'm not in a hospital.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Well, all the more reason to take extra care, Claire. Look, it's okay, I can take care of turnip-head for a while.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CLAIRE: Turnip-head?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: It's just what I'm calling him until you give him a name because his head -- it's like a turnip.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CLAIRE: What if he needs something, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: You'll be there for him -- after you sleep.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CLAIRE: No, okay? No.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Claire, no one is going to take this baby away from you. No one.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CLAIRE: You don't know that, okay. You can't say that.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: I won't let anything happen.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CLAIRE:  Just be really careful, okay? Make sure if he gets hot that you take his blanket off -- his neck, okay, got his neck?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Got it.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: This was his. I didn't go through it.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: Thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Welcome. Storm coming. I should have said no -- the first time he offered to hunt with me I should have said no.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: He would have gone anyway.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Yeah, I suppose he would have. I know how confused and angry you must be right now. I can't say I understand what you're going through, but I know what it feels like when you lose family. I hope you can forgive me. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: You asked if you could do anything for me.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: John Locke killed my brother. Will you do something about that?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Little more.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: You need to get your blood sugar level up.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Look, enough already. I've rested. 
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: I'm fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Where are you going?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: I'm going to go talk to Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: You need to lie down.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: No, I don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: I strongly advise it.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Advise?  Advice -- alright, what's going on now?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Lie down, okay. I crushed up some sleeping pills -- put them in your juice.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Why would you -- you drugged me?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Oh, okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Night.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: How did you get that? 
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: War wound.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Looks more like a surgical scar.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Like I said, war wound.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: The plane's radio? Was Boone able to pick up a signal?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: I was on the ground, all I could here was static.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: But it was working?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Yeah, but I can't imagine it survived the fall.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Some of its parts might work in the transmitter I'm building for the raft. If you'd be willing to take me?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Of course.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: How did you find this plane?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Luck.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: You and Boone were hunting.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Was that a question?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: The boar got scarce a couple of weeks back. We weren't hunting, we were exploring.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: So you just happened upon a Beechcraft perched in the trees?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Yep.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: At the funeral you said your leg was injured.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: It was just a charlie-horse. A cramp.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I know what a charlie-horse is, John.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Back in Iraq you were an interrogator.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Is that a question?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: A long time ago I was.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Well, you haven't lost your touch.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Why would I interrogate you, John?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Jack called me a liar in front of every man, woman and child I've come to know over the past month. Maybe there's a part of you that thinks maybe there isn't a plane out here at all.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I know when I'm being lied to. There's a plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Like I said, you haven't lost your touch.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: You've lost your edge, old man.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: I never had one when playing against you.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Were you always this slow?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: C'mon, c'mon, let's keep playing.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: You have to get out of that apartment -- practice more.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: Haddad would like that -- more blending in with the community.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I think he's got his eye on a target.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: What makes you say that?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: For the last 2 weeks he's been asking me about explosives -- blast radius, transport.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: Haddad's very thorough.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Do you know if he's gotten hold of any yet?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: Explosives? I don't know. All I know is there's going to be an operation -- and there is going to be a martyr.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: You?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: Haddad told me this morning. C'mon let's keep playing. C'mon -- I'll wipe the floor with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Essam, what is it, huh? What is it?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: I don't think I can do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: You're kidding me, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Listen to me, I can get Essam to turn himself in. He wants out.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: Does he know where the C-4 is?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: The other two are the ones you want. Essam's confused-
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: Does he know where it is?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: Then he's useless. These cells run top down. It's all need-to-know. The recruit's handed a bomb and target at the last possible moment. The only way to find that C-4 is to wait for Essam to walk out that door with a target to hit.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: He's in over his head. He doesn't even know why he's doing it...
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: That's why you're going to convince him to go through with it.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: No. No, I will not.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT HEWITT: Excuse me?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I'm done. It's over.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT HEWITT: No, no, you're not even close to being done, my friend.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: What are you going to do? Arrest me?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: No, we'll arrest her. Your girlfriend's an Iraqi living abroad with a record of insurgency. Wouldn't it be terrible if she got picked up as an enemy combatant, Sayid? So, if you want any chance of ever seeing her again you're going to go and talk your good friend Essam into blowing himself up.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: The itsy-bitsy spider climbed up the spout, down came the rain and drowned the spider out...
Lost.Season01.Episode21 HURLEY: Dude, it's washed -- washed the spider out. Unless it's some kind of British version?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Oh, okay. Down came the rain and washed the spider -- oh, bollocks, shhhh, shhh, shhh.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 HURLEY: What's the matter, man?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Well, I can't get the bloody thing to stop crying.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 HURLEY: Maybe it's hungry?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Nope, Claire nursed him 5 times.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 HURLEY: Any deposits? You know, diaper-wise?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 HURLEY: Alright, it's time to break out the big guns.  Dude, that's all I got.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID:  Heroin.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: The cargo hold's full of it. The best I can figure it -- they were smugglers.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: The plane was perched in the canopy?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Right up there.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: And Boone climbed up by himself because of your charlie-horse?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Yes, that's right.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Why did you lie?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: I made a mistake.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I'm going to salvage what I can of the radio. If we leave now we should beat the storm back.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Why don't you trust me, Sayid?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: For one thing, you've been carrying a gun you've told no one about.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE:  We found one of the smugglers about a half a click West of here dressed as a priest -- Nigerian currency in his pockets, and this. Now you're armed and I'm not. Does that earn me any trust?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: You gave this to me because I caught you concealing it. That earns you adaptability.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Okay, I'll tell you something you don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Please do.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: The first week after the crash there was a cave in. Jack was trapped. Do you remember that?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Of course.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: You, Kate and Sawyer went out into the jungle to try and triangulate a signal.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: You were hit from behind -- knocked unconscious? When you woke up your transceiver, your equipment was destroyed. That was me.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: This is one time you'd better not be telling the truth.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: I did what was in everyone's best interest.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: You ruined my chance to find the source.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: The source of a distress call that kept saying they're dead, it killed them all, over and over? Is that a place you really want to lead people to?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Why wait all this time? Why not tell me then?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Because back then you wouldn't have engaged in reasonable debate, and nobody else would have. You were all so focused on getting off the Island that you weren't seeing things clearly. It's like what's happening now with the raft.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Did you burn the raft, John?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: No, Sayid, I didn't.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: What is the hatch?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: The hatch?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Boone mentioned it before he died.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: A hatch? Two hatches on a plane, Sayid, could be forward or aft.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: I'm not sure if I can do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: You would not be a martyr if you didn't have to overcome fear, Essam.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: I'm not afraid to die. It's all the innocent lives -- all those people. The Imam preaches peace, Sayid. Every human life is sacred.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: It's true, innocent lives will be lost -- in service of a greater good.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: What if I'm doing this because I'm angry? What if I'm doing this because they killed her?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: What if you are? Should we just accept what happened to Zahra? Do we just accept their deaths? Because if we do, it means that ultimately we can do nothing about them. I lost someone, too, Essam. I will never be whole again. There need to be consequences for those responsible. That's my duty. That is how I will honor her.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: Haddad was right, it was fate that brought us back together. Sayid, will you do this with me?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I will.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: How are you? Do you want to take a walk?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: Sure.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I spoke to Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: What did he say?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: He took me to the plane. I believe what happened was an accident.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: Then why did he lie?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I have no idea. But I don't believe he meant to harm Boone.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: So that's it?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I know how strong the need can be to find someone to blame.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: You don't get it, do you?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Shannon.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: Just forget about it, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 WALT: How much weight can this hold?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 MICHAEL: I don't know. A lot. Enough.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JIN: 그거... 조여줘요.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, tighter. Got it.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 WALT: What if it tips over?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 MICHAEL: It won't. That's why we made it this wide. There, that should do it. Right? Good?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JIN: Good.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 MICHAEL: Alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 WALT: What if a shark attacks?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 MICHAEL: A shark's not getting anywhere near us, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 WALT: What if we die?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 MICHAEL: We are not going to die.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 WALT: Boone died.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE:  Hey, Michael, do you know anything about babies? I can't get this little guy to be quiet.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 MICHAEL: Walk with him, he'll calm down.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Yeah, I tried that. Hey, Jin, have you seen Sun?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JIN: 어?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Sun. I need some help with this baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JIN: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAWYER:  Hey, Chuckie, want to keep that kid quiet? Baby Huey's like nails on a chalkboard.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE:  Oh, there you go. You happy now? 
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAWYER: I was. If you're going to play nursemaid, at least do the damn job. 
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Hey, say something else. Just say something, say anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAWYER: Okay, fine. I liked that thing a lot better inside than I like it outside.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Hey -- brought you something to eat.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: What's in it, chloroform?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Soup.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Thanks, but I think I'll --  Who was in here?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: I don't know, what's the matter...
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Was anybody in here?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: No, why are you...
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: The key to the gun case, it's gone.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: Maybe it fell off this morning.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: It didn't fall off.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Locke took the key -- he's after the guns.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: I haven't seen him all day, you don't know that...
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: No, then who was it?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Jack, it wasn't Locke.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 HADDAD: Sayid, get in. It's time.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 HADDAD: Stay relaxed and focused; drive with the windows down -- the fresh air will keep you alert. You will need to wear these . If you run into any problems use this . You are heroes. Good luck.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Essam stop.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: Don't be nervous, brother. We'll be okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I'm working with the CIA.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I'm going to give you 10 minutes to get away before I call them.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: You set me up?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Essam, just go.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: Why would you do this to me?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: You're wasting time.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: You said we were going to do this together. You said you lost someone.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Her name is Nadia. We were separated years ago. They know where I can find her.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: You used me to find a woman?  You talked me into this.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Essam, don't.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: You said it was for the greater good.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I'm begging you to go.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: You said you were my brother. You were supposed to be my brother, my friend.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I am your friend.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: A friend who told me to do this for Zahra just so you could find some woman that you love?!
Lost.Season01.Episode21 ESSAM: Well, then, Sayid, I hope she makes you whole again.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Essam!
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Go! Go.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: She doesn't believe me, Sayid.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Shannon, Shannon, please listen to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: He did it. I know it.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: You're not thinking rationally. You've never fired a gun before.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Shannon, you don't want to do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: Yes, I do!
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: If you do it, you can never take it back.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: Stay back! What did you do to him?!
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: I told you it was an accident.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 JACK: Shannon.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: Jack, you told me he was a liar!
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SHANNON: Don't. Get away.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Shannon.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAWYER:  The low rumble breaks the crisp fall air as a flash of red streaks down the maple-dappled Vermont highway.  The 32 valve V-8 engine purrs as the transmission clicks down a gear and the vehicle unleashes all 400 horses and 350 pound feet rear-wheel torque.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE:  Keep going. Keep going.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CLAIRE: Charlie.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAWYER: Beneath the hood the 4.4 liter power plant features a fully integrated super-charger made into a 6 speed transmission from the manual sequential shift feature.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 CHARLIE: Keep going.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAWYER: This smooth-riding sports car offers a bewitching blend of taste, comfort and economy.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: She just needs time. She's been through a lot.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Time won't make a difference. Perhaps I made a mistake.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 KATE: You couldn't let her kill Locke. You had no choice.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: There's always a choice.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: She lives in Irvine, California, just south of Los Angeles -- works as a lab-tech at a medical testing company -- plane ticket, walking around money, you're on an Oceanic flight to LA. It leaves in two hours.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: What happens to his body?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT COLE: He was a terrorist so he's not exactly getting a state funeral.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: What happens to his body?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT HEWITT: After it's released; he'll be cremated.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: A Muslim man is supposed to be buried.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT HEWITT: Yeah, well, there's no one to claim the body.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I'll claim him.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 AGENT HEWITT: You can't claim him when you're on a plane in 2 hours, mate.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Then change my flight to tomorrow. 
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: How's your head?
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: It'll heal.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: Another war wound.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: I know what it cost you to do what you did. Thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: I did it because I sense you might be our best hope of surviving here. But I don't forgive what you did. And I certainly don't trust you. And now, you're going to take me to the hatch.
Lost.Season01.Episode21 LOCKE: Hatch? -- I already showed you the...
Lost.Season01.Episode21 SAYID: John, no more lies.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Hi. I'm expecting a letter -- hold for guest arrival.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SANJAY: Sure, what's your name?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Joan Hart.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SANJAY:  Oh, Joan Hart.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 CHARLIE: Platinum.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Platinum?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 CHARLIE: As in platinum record -- as in a million units sold. Now, Drive Shaft's albums must have spiked when everybody found out that I died in some catastrophic plane disaster. When I come back, alive, it's going to be insane.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: So you think the raft's going to work?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 CHARLIE: Yeah, of course it will work, look at that thing. It's not a raft. They built a sodding boat. And when they get picked up, the helicopters will come, making us ridiculously and eternally famous. What's the matter, don't you want to be famous?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: What do you think is going on over there?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 ARZT: Sure, you can absolutely wait a few weeks before you launch. I was just assuming you didn't want to die.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: So, when is the next time we can launch?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 ARZT: 3, maybe 4, months.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: C'mon, even a weather man on TV don't know what's going to happen. Why are we listening to Arzt?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 ARZT: Because I'm a doctor, and you're a hillbilly.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: You're a damn high school science teacher.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Hey, Sawyer, just let the man talk.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 ARZT: It's been raining every afternoon. That means that we are on the cusp on monsoon season. Monsoon season is bad. Now, the trade winds are blowing north right now -- shipping lanes are north -- so north is exactly where you want to be.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: What does that mean?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 ARZT: It means that when monsoon season hits the trade winds are going to shift to the south. The raft goes with the wind. Can anyone tell me what is the only piece of land that is south of us?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Antarctica.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 ARZT: That's right, Jack, Antarctica.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: So, when do we have to leave?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 ARZT: Yesterday.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: So obviously you believe him?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Arzt? I don't know, but I'm not taking any chances.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: You think you'll be ready by tomorrow?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: The man said not a day to waste.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Supplies all set? You've got food, fresh water?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Kate, no offense, but I've got work to do. Why the sudden interest?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Because I'm going with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Look, the raft's full -- we need 4, we got 4.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Including Sawyer?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Including him. We needed the stuff he had so he bought his way on.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: To the first raft, which burned.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: You know, I'm not going to get into semantics with you. I told the guy...
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: He doesn't even know how to sail.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: And you do?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: I spent 2 summers crewing J boats. I know my way around a sailboat.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Yeah, maybe so, but a deal's a deal. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: You're bringing Walt, too? I'm just saying it's dangerous.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: I decide what's best for my boy. And right now, what's best for him is to get the hell off this Island. The raft's full.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 HOSPITAL ANNOUNCEMENT:  Hospital chaplain to the neural ICU. Hospital chaplain please report to the neural ICU.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: I have a delivery for Diane Jansen.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 NURSE: Right, she just came up from ICU. She's in room 208. It's around the corner to your right.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 NURSE: You're welcome.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE:  Hey, Tom.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: Oh, Katie. What are you doing here?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Diane's dying of cancer. I thought I owed it to her to come see her.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: I heard. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Yeah, me too.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: So any particular reason why you're hanging out in the back of my car?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: I need your help.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SUN: 당신도 갈 거에요? 여보, 제발 나랑 얘기 좀 해요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JIN: 나도 갈 거야. 
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: How much further?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAYID: We're almost there.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: You want to tell me where we're going, Sayid?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAYID: It's better that you see it for yourself.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: No, I'm not so sure that it is. Tell me why you brought me out here or I'm going to turn around.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE:  He brought you out here because I asked him to. I asked him not to tell you. I wanted you to have an open mind.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Open mind about what?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: My god, what is this thing?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: Exactly. I guess it's time we talked about this.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Yo, chief, dumb question here -- we're sailing out in the ocean, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Do you mind?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Sulu over here is packing a suitcase full of salted fish.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: We can't catch fish?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Do you know anything about surviving at sea -- sailing, navigating, steering a raft?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Do you?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: It doesn't matter what I know, I built it. Maybe you are the wrong guy to go on the raft.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: You're going to vote me off, Mickey? And who the hell's going to take my place?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: What the hell do you think you're doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Don't give me the awe-golly eyes. Michael just told me you were jockeying for my spot on the raft.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: I was just asking some questions. He must have misunderstood me.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER:  I know what you're doing.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Yeah?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Yeah, just like I know why you wanted that Halliburton case so bad -- the one that belonged to that U.S. Marshal who was flying with us. You were his prisoner.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Let go of me.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: The only chance of running is getting on that raft, ain't it? We get picked up by a ship and they come back to rescue the rest of you all -- there's going to be a nice big asterisk next to your name. Don't worry puddin', your secret's safe with me. But just so you know -- no way in hell you're getting my spot on that raft.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Hey Sawyer. I want your spot, I'll get your spot.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Hey, give me that water, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT:  Yo, dad.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: So what were you and Sawyer arguing about?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: I told him something he didn't want to hear.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: Why does he want to get on the raft so much?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Because he knows it's going to work.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: When we get rescued we're going to come back for everybody else, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Yeah, sure, of course. The thing is -- this Island, uh, is, uh -- finding it again might be hard.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: Can't we fly around and look for it?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Absolutely, but there's no guarantees. That's why you and me-
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: Dad?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Oh . That's why you and... 
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: Dad! Dad!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Get Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: Help! I need help. It's my dad.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: What's the matter?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: His stomach is really bad.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE:  Take him back to Michael. I'll go get Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SUN: Okay. Let's go.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: This way.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Jack! Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: How long have you known about this?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: 3 weeks, give or take.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: 3 weeks. You've been out here for 3 weeks digging this thing up and you never told me about it?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: All due respect, Jack, but since when do I report to you?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: All due respect, John, but you lied.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: How long did you have that case full of guns before you decided the rest of us needed to know? You used your best discretion. I used mine.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: So how do we open it?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAYID: What? You want to open it?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAYID: We should bury it! I brought you here to talk him out of this insanity. Anything could be inside!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Best case scenario there's supplies -- worst case, we use it as a shelter.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAYID: Actually, Jack, I can think of much worse cases than that. You notice anything about this hatch? There's no handle. Could the reason for that be more obvious?! Maybe it was never meant to be opened from the outside.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Jack! Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Yeah, over here!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: It's Michael, something's wrong.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: What'd you eat today?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Uh, fruit, fish.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: You drinking enough water?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: 2 or 3 bottles.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Where are you getting that water from?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: You know, the caves, like everybody else.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Alright, listen, Michael, just take it easy, okay? You stay in the shade and try not to move too much, okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: No. We have to launch that raft tomorrow. We have to.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: I know, I know. I need you to lay back.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Lay down. Just lay down, okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM:  Hello? Hey, Adam, hey, listen can you carve out some time for me on the MRI? Yeah, it's a favor for a friend of a friend. Um, no, that would work out great, okay. Yeah, thanks, Adam.  His name's Conner.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: How old is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: 22 months next week.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: He's beautiful.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: Yeah, well, it's Rachel, it's not me.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Where is she?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: She's over in Cedar Rapids visiting her folks. They get back on Sunday. I got Diane in for an MRI. Now, they'll bring her downstairs to radiology. The appointment's not til 5am, so, we've got about 3 hours to kill.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Tom...
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: You're welcome.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: You think it's still there?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: You know what.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: It's the middle of the night, Katie.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: We might not get another chance.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: What do you think it is? Heatstroke?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: No, he would have felt that coming on.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: Bad fruit maybe? Raw fish?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Michael and Jin are on the same diet.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: Well, Jin's fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK:  Jin's fine. What was making him sick was metabolized fast. It hit him quick and it hit him hard.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: So you think it was the water.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK:  No, I don't think it was the water. I think it was something in the water.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Feeling any better?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: The cramps are quieting down -- as long as I don't move, or, -- or breathe.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: You and Locke kiss and make up?  Good.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: No, Michael.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Drink from that one.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Somebody did this to me?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: I don't know. I'm not sure of anything yet.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 HURLEY: I'm on bamboo duty, but yeah, sometimes I help refill the water.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: Michael and Jin getting along?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 HURLEY: Well, they fight like a married couple building a raft together...
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE:  You told him?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Think Sawyer might have done it.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 HURLEY: Oh, because of Kate?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Kate?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 HURLEY: Yeah, I guess she wants on the raft. So Sawyer went off on Michael because, you know, he gets to decide who goes. Hey, you don't think Kate did it, do you?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: Why would Kate poison Michael?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 HURLEY: Well, you know, the whole fugitive thing.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 HURLEY: He doesn't know?  Well how am I supposed to keep straight who knows what around here? I mean, Steve didn't even know about the polar bear.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: What did she do?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: I don't know. Why don't you ask her?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: And you didn't think the others should know about this, Jack?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Discretion, John.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 CLAIRE: Okay, can you stop moving or I'm going to cut your ear off.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 CHARLIE: Ah, this is good. I'm writing again. I'm really feeling it, as well. So, what's the first thing you're going to do when we get rescued?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 CLAIRE: You know, I don't really know.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 CHARLIE: You can hang out with me in L.A. -- you and turnip-head. You know, until you figure things out.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 CLAIRE: Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 CHARLIE: Smashing. Okay, check this out. This is track 2. It's called...  Sorry. It's called "Monster Eats the Pilot".
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: How's Michael?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: He's going to be fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Somebody going to be taking his place on the raft?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Because, you know, Dr. Arzt said if they leave tomorrow...
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Did you poison Michael, Kate?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: He's not sick, someone did this.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Do you really think I'm capable of that?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: I don't know what you're capable of.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: You brought beer?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: No self-respecting man in Iowa goes anywhere without beer.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: It's not fair, you know -- you coming back. Here. Home.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Yeah, I know.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: Wow.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Wow. Oh.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: Oh my god. My plane.  I can't believe I let you talk me into putting this in there.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: That was your idea.  Kate and Tom, 1989.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 YOUNG TOM: Is it on? I don't think it's on.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 YOUNG KATE: It's on.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 YOUNG TOM: Okay, this is Kate Austen and Tom Brennan and this is our dedication for our time capsule, here on August 15th, 1989. Hey, give me that back.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 YOUNG KATE: Why are you putting this stupid plane in there?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 YOUNG TOM: Because it's cool, Katie. I got it when I flew to Dallas by myself.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 YOUNG KATE: Ooh, that is cool, just like this time capsule.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 YOUNG TOM: It'll be totally cool when we dig it up in like 20 years.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 YOUNG KATE: How do you know we'll be together?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 YOUNG TOM: Because we'll be married and you'll be a mom and we'll have 9 kids.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 YOUNG KATE: I don't think so. As soon as I get my license we should just get in a car and drive. You know, run away.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 YOUNG TOM: You always want to run away, Katie.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 YOUNG KATE: Yeah, and you know why.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: Funny how things turn out, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: We'd better get to the hospital.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: I had a little accident.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: Does it hurt?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: Yep. Something you want to tell me, Walt?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: I didn't do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: Didn't do what?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: I heard Jack. He thinks somebody got my dad sick. And I didn't do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: You think because I know you burned the first raft that I'd think you made your dad sick?  We're friends, Walt. I didn't tell on you before and I'm not going to tell on you now.  And I know you would never do anything to hurt your dad.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: What's the matter?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: Don't open it.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: What'd you say?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: Don't open it, Mr. Locke. Don't open that thing.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 LOCKE: What? What thing?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: Just don't open it.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Thought you might need that, boss. Wouldn't want our pilot out of commission before take-off.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: What? You feeling guilty?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: You're off the raft.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Come again?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: You're off the raft!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: We had a deal.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Yeah, well, the deal ended the minute you decided to poison me.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: I did what now?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: I'm done with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: You ain't done with me by a damn sight. You said you needed 4!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: I've got 4! You've been stealing stuff off of dead bodies, keeping it for yourself, using it to buy favors. You're a liar and a criminal, and I'm not letting you near my boy!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Oh, I'm a criminal, huh?! I poisoned you because I'm a criminal!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER:  Get your hands off me, boy.  Hey, sweet-cheeks! I had no idea how bad you wanted off this rock. Time to set things straight.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Let go of me.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Tell him who the criminal is!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 CHARLIE: Hey, leave her alone, man!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Tell him!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Give that back.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Leave her alone!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Leave her alone?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Give that back.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Mmm-hmmm. Look. Look at this.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Sawyer, please.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: You all remember Joanna, don't you? Huh? The woman who drowned?  Now what's Kate doing with poor Joanna's ID? Could it be she'd do just about anything to get on that raft? So she could get herself rescued, run off with a new identity before half the reporters in the world descend on this damn Island? She might even poison the captain himself.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Shut up!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: She don't care about nothin' or nobody but herself.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM:  This is good here. Thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: My office is right back there. I'll wait for you.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Hi, mom. Can you hear me? Mom?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Mom?  It's me, Katie.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 DIANE: Katherine?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: It's me, Katherine. I'm so sorry for everything that I have put you through.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 DIANE:  Help. Help.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: It's okay, mom. It's just me.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 DIANE:  Help. Help.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: It's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 DIANE: Help. Help me. Help me! Somebody help me! Help me, somebody.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SECURITY GUARD: What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: I'm her daughter. She's just confused. I was going to get a doctor.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SECURITY GUARD:  Hang on.  We've got a situation-
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: I need your car keys. 
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM:  Kate, Katie?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Get out.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: I am not letting you do this. Katie, if you cooperate they go easy...
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: He's calling for backup! I've got to go! Get out!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: You can have a real life.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Tom, please.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Now. Get out.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 TOM: No!
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Tom? Tom! Oh god, Tom. No, no, no, Tom. Please wake up.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: You want to tell us why you need to run so bad? You want to tell us the truth?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Yes. I was on the plane -- with the Marshal. Yes, I was wanted and caught and being transported back. No matter what I say about what happened -- about what I supposedly did -- I'm going to jail.  But I didn't poison you.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL:  Here.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: He looks determined.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SUN: Yes, he is.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: You don't want him to go, do you?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SUN: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: Is that why you tried to make him sick? Michael and Jin working together all the time -- pretty easy for them to get their water bottles mixed up...
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SUN: I didn't want him to die out there. I just didn't know what to do. I only used enough to make him -- I wasn't trying to hurt him. Are you going to tell the others?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 JACK: I don't see any reason why they need to know. But Sun, he's going. If I were you, I'd -- I'd say goodbye.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: I'm back on the raft.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: I'm glad to hear it.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Michael's going to cowboy up. We set sail tomorrow.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Are you here to say sorry, Sawyer?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Nah, sorry don't suit me. You cornered me, Freckles. I did what I had to.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: I cornered you?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: You said if you wanted my spot you were going to take it. I guess I believed you. Well, that's that. I've got some packing to do.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Why is it so important for you to be on that raft?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: 'Cuz there ain't anything on this Island worth staying for.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Be safe, Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SAWYER: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: Dad.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Hey, buddy.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: Feeling better?
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Yeah, yep. I'm going to be alright. Hey, don't worry. I'm going to be on my feet soon. We'll be sailing home before you can even-
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: I'm the one that burned the raft. I didn't want to leave and I thought I could stop you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, dad.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 MICHAEL: Hey, it's okay, man. We can stay here. You and me. We don't have to go.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 WALT: Yes we do.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SUN: Hello.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SUN: Jack knows. I didn't tell him it was your idea.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SUN: Why should you be punished? You were only trying to help me. He said he wouldn't tell the others.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Yeah, Jack's good at keeping secrets.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 SUN: When I was a little girl I believed that once I found the man I loved I would be happy, forever.
Lost.Season01.Episode22 KATE: Yeah, me too.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: Watching TV.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: Oh, man, do you see what time it is? Go back to sleep, Walt.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: I always watch this show.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: Okay, then, can you at least turn it down a little.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: I said turn it down, Walt.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: Brian lets me watch it as loud as I want.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: I'm not Brian.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: Let's go, Vincent.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: Hey, where do you think you're going?  Hey, Walt.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT:  Get away from me! Leave me alone!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: Don't even - don't you think about it.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: I said get away from me!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: Don't you walk away from me.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: Look, I don't think so. Come on.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: Get off of me!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: I don't like this either, but you're getting on that plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: No, I'm not!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 STEVE: What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: It's okay, I'm his father.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: No, you're not. You're not my father! You're not my father!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: Dad! Dad, wake up!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: What? What?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: Somebody's here.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: Hey, hey, hey, hey, stop, slow, slow down. Stay right there.  Who is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: She's got to be the French chick.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAYID: Calm down everyone. It's alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAYID: Danielle? Danielle? What are you doing here?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: The Others are coming.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: Our ship went aground on this Island 16 years ago. There were 6 of us -- my team, 6. At that time I was already 7 months pregnant. I delivered the infant myself. The baby and I were together for only 1 week when I saw black smoke -- a pillar of black smoke 5 kilometers inland. That night they came, they came and took her -- Alex. They took my baby. And now, they're coming again. They're coming for all of you.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Who's coming?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: The Others. You have only 3 choices: run, hide, or die.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: This is a woman who blew up her own shelter. And now she's talking about seeing black smoke and hearing whispers. I mean, she's not playing with a full deck.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 LOCKE: That doesn't mean that what she's saying isn't true.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Well, if you want to focus on the "what if,", be my guest, but I've got to stick with what's tangible. And right now, that's the launching of the raft.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: How's it going?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: I wanted to get off today, but, realistically, man, after we get the rudder done, we've still got to lay the rails to get it down to the water.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN: Good.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Wouldn't it save time if we were laying the rails while you were finishing the rudder?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: Manpower shortage.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: What do you need to lay the rails and then move the boat?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: To get it all done today? Pretty much everybody.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Alright, give me 20 minutes.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Grab as many palm tree logs as you can find, the longer the better. Take them over to the raft area and Michael will know what to do with them.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 REDSHIRT: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: You need to get them in there tight. You need leverage to get them on the rails. Good, that's good. Okay, that's good man. Just get it under there, okay? Okay.  You alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 LOCKE: Yep.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: So, listen, on my count - I'll do 1-2-3—lift and then push, okay? Got it? Okay, c'mon. Once we get it down to the water line, we'll drop it and load it up. Alright. Ready. 1-2-3! Lift!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: Push! Push, c'mon guys, push, push! Use the levers, use the levers! Good, good. 1-2-3, lift!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: I can't believe this  Can't believe it.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: What are you looking at me for?! It's not my fault!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: You missed a lever!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: Because you couldn't keep the raft going straight!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: I couldn't keep the boat going straight? Everybody's attention-
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: Dad! Look.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: How many of them are there?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: I told you all I know.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAYID: There has to be more you tell us. How did you know?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: You have a bigger problem. I can vanish into the jungle, but I'm just one person. You have 40 people. Where will you hide them?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Dude. Whoa.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: What is this?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: We were hoping you could tell us.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: I have never seen anything like it.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Uh, question -- how do we know we can all, like, fit in there?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 LOCKE: No handle on the outside, means there must be another way in. Another entrance means space.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAYID: This is a mistake. We don't know anything about these Others. We're reacting with no information, no intelligence. This hatch might even be theirs. Black smoke on the horizon doesn't mean they're-
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: It means they're coming!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Yeah, we got that.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 LOCKE: You booby-trapped your shelter with explosives. You have any more?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: Dynamite, at the Black Rock, in the dark territory.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Well, that's 3 reasons to go right there.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: If we're to make it back by sunset we have to leave within the hour.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: Tequila and tonic with a wedge of lemon.  Why were you yelling? -- The girl, at the check-in counter? You were yelling at her.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: I'm sorry, uh, do I know you?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: I'm on your flight. LA? So your dad died, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: I thought you didn't hear what I was yelling about.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: I was being polite.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Yeah. My dad died.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: How?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: A heart attack.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: Not a drinker, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: No, no, not really.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: No ring because you're single or because you don't like wearing one?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: You asking me if I'm married?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: Are you married?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: No. No, not any more.  Can we get another tequila and tonic, please?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: I didn't think you were listening.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: So, what's your name?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: Ana Lucia.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: So, tell me, Ana Lucia, why are you drinking tequila and tonics at ten to noon?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: I hate flying. And they stuck me all the way in the back of the plane where the wheels come down right under your damn feet. So where are you sitting?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK:  23B.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: 42F. Wanna trade?  Hey, yeah. I'm in Sydney. Hold on.  Sorry...
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: Jack, I've got to talk. We'll have the next drink on the plane, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: 42F.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ANA LUCIA: 42F, right. And Jack, the worst part's over.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Look, I know you're all scared. And I know everybody has a lot of questions. All I can tell you right now is that we do have a plan. We've got to go into the jungle to get some supplies. We'll be back in a few hours. In the meantime, do everything you can to help Michael get that raft on the water. And after that, go to the caves. We'll be back as soon as we can. I promise.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: Hey, nice speech. Plan's a little flawed, but, hey, nobody's perfect.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: What plan?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: Yeah, your plan. You're going to go into the jungle and get some dynamite and blow open a hatch and then you're going to hide everyone inside. You want to keep a secret, don't tell the fat guy.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: What do you want, Arzt?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: God knows how long that dynamite has been out there. And from what I can tell, Madam Nutso doesn't seem too concerned with how to handle it. So, unless you want to blow up, I'm coming with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Okay. Grab some water bottles. We're leaving in half an hour.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: We can salvage the cable but we need new bamboo for the mast.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN:  이거, 어떻게 다시 얹어 놓지?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: We need to fix the rudder before we even start to think about that.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN: 올리다가 방향키가 부러지면 어떡해?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: Need some help?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL:  Let's just get this done first.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: Hey, this wasn't my fault. So put me to work.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: No offense, we just work faster this way, okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN: 다 끝나셨어요? 일 좀 할까요?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL:  Alright, alright. What do you think I'm doing over here?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CALDERWOOD: You remember me? 3 nights ago? You were hauled in here thrashing and fighting. As you were being escorted by you kicked my desk. And you broke my mug. 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: Nice kids.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CALDERWOOD: Sadly for you, breaking my mug was not the most significant mistake you made that evening.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: C'mon, Doctor, I got into a bar fight. Isn't that a badge of honor in this country?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CALDERWOOD: Do you know who you head-butted in that bar? You head-butted the Honorable Warren Truss, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry. One of the most important pe-
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: He head-butted me.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CALDERWOOD: We have witnesses he did no such thing.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: Of course.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CALDERWOOD: You think this is funny, James?  James Ford, assault, wire fraud, identity theft, bank fraud, telemarketing fraud...
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: This going some place?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CALDERWOOD: You're a blight, a stain, a scavenger. You're a conman who prays on the weak and the needy. Tell me something, James, how do you live with yourself?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: I do just fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CALDERWOOD: Do you? You're not even worth what it would cost us to incarcerate you. Which is why you're being deported. Your plane leaves this afternoon. And, James, you're banned from ever setting foot in Australia again.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: Don't you worry, I ain't ever coming back here.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CALDERWOOD: Best not, mate.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: A lumberjack.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: Excuse me?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: I never asked you what you did back in the real world, so, I'm taking a wild guess -- lumberjack.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: Something I can help you with, Doc, because I've got work to do.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK:  I've got something for you. You're the only one on the raft who knows how to use one.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: What do I need a gun for?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Just in case.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: You think we're going to run out of food or water? Am I supposed to put the kid out of his misery?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Just in case.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: What are you doing with the rest of them?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: I'm giving them to Sayid.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: Going into the jungle after the boom sticks, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: By the time you get back, we'll be in the water. Guess this is pretty much goodbye, then.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Yeah, I guess it is. Good luck, Sawyer.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER:  Jack. -- About a week before we all got on the plane, I got to talking to this man in a bar in Sydney. He was American, too. A doctor. I've been on some benders in my time, but this guy -- he was going for an all time record. So, it turns out this guy has a son. His son's a doctor, too. They had some kind of big time falling out. The guy knew it was his fault, even though his son was back in the States thinking the same damn thing. See, kids are like dogs, you knock them around enough they'll think they did something to deserve it. Anyway, there's a pay phone in this bar. And this guy, Christian, tells me he wishes he had the stones to pick up the phone, call his kid, tell him he's sorry, that he's a better doctor than he'll ever be -- he's proud, and he loves him. I had to take off, but -- something tells me he never got around to making that call. Small world, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: Good luck, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL:  You going to be armed?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MARSHAL: Yes, sir, ankle holster.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL: You have to stow this in the crew luggage compartment in the front.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MARSHAL: No problemo.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL: Why do you need 5 guns?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MARSHAL: Gee, you want to tell him, Kate? Why do I need 5 guns?  She's shy.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL:  What's this, then?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MARSHAL: That's a good story, you want to tell it, huh, Kate?  This belonged to her childhood sweetheart who she got killed a couple of years ago when she was on the run. Poor guy -- a wife, a 2 year old kid. What was his name? Hmm? Well, somewhere along the way during the 3 years that I was chasing her, she starts calling me, at my house, and whining on about her mitigating circumstances. But what she's really doing is taunting me. So, I tell her that I've got whats-his-name's little toy airplane in a safe deposit box in New Mexico. So, she somehow figures out which bank, which safe deposit box. She seduces some idiot to rob the damn bank, and then she puts a bullet in her new friend because she's done using him. But she leaves all the money. She just takes the plane because that's the one thing in the whole world that Kate does care about. She has no attachments, and I think she's telling herself she needs it to atone for killing her boyfriend, whats-his-name. God, Kate, c'mon, what was his name?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 KATE: Tom, it's Tom, you son-of-a-bitch!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MARSHAL: And that is why I need 5 guns.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 KATE: So, you're heading out?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 KATE: I was thinking that I might go with you -- for old time's sake? I want to help.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: You won't be here for the raft launching.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 KATE: Yeah, well, I'm -- I'm not very good at goodbyes.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Grab your stuff.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CHARLIE:  Thanks, man, I'll keep it safe. Hey, Locke, do you have a message? It's going on the raft. You know: "Dear mom, Everything's fine. I'm on the Island, unless, of course, the black smoke people turn up. Love, your name here." For when they get rescued—they can contact your family.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 LOCKE: Message in a bottle. That's sweet. 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CHARLIE:  You ready?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Here you go.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CHARLIE: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Don't look at it.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CHARLIE: You got it. 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Dude! Do not look at it.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CHARLIE: Arzt, do you want paper?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: I gave at the office.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CHARLIE: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: Careful.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Good luck, dude.  Keep dry, kiddo.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: I will.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL:  Hey, good luck.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK:  Same to you.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: See you soon.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Yes, you will.  Hey, guy, look after your dad, okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: I will.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Alright.  Jin.  Good luck.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN: 조심해요.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 KATE:  Hey, have -- have you seen Sawyer?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CHARLIE: No.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Alright, let's go.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 CHARLIE:  Take care, okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 LOCKE: Where'd you get the scratches?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: A bush.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 LOCKE: Mean bush.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: We've got to keep moving.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Let me ask you something, Arnzt.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: Arzt.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Arnzt.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: No, not Arnzt, Arzt. A-R-Z-T, Arzt.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Sorry, man, the name's hard to pronounce.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: Yeah, well, I know a bunch of 9th graders who pronounce it just fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: How about I just call you by your first name?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: How about you don't?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Why not? I remember it from the plane's manifest. I think Leslie's a bitchin' name.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: Arnzt is fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: Le Territoire Fonce.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: The Dark Territory.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: The Black Rock is not far. This is where it all began -- where my team got infected, where Montand lost his arm. We must move quickly.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: You know what? I'm going back.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Hey, I thought you wanted to help.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: Yeah, I wanted to help and that was before Montand lost his fricking arm.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Well, what about the dynamite?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: Just be very careful with it.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: No, no, no! This one goes there! That one goes there!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN: Okay, okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER:  Hey, Chief! Cut and measured to length -- perfect mast.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: Well, alright. Now, are we going to get off this rock or stand around talking about it?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 KATE: Did you hear that?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: Run! Run! Run!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: Run!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: What are you...
Lost.Season01.Episode23 LOCKE: Just be still.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE:  Here, in here.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Dude, we've got to book.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 LOCKE: Wait. It's headed the other way.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: We're safe now.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 KATE: What was that thing?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: It's a security system.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JACK: Security system? What does that mean?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: Its purpose is that of any security systems -- to protect something.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 KATE: Protect what?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: The Island.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Uh, where's Arnzt?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT:  It's Arzt, you idiot.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 HURLEY: Dude, I thought you were dead.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 ARZT: Can we just, please, go get the dynamite, please?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: Why are you folding the clothes?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: Because I'm anal. Is there something you want?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: I think you should take Vincent.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: Are you serious?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: He'll take care of you.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: What makes you think I need a dog to take care of me?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: Vincent took care of me when my mom died -- and nobody would talk to me. They pretended like nothing happened. So I had to talk to Vincent. He's a good listener. You could talk to him about Boone if you want.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: Alright, but only until you get us rescued, okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT:  Flight 338 to Fiji will be delayed. Please check the board for flight details.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAYID: Excuse me, would you mind watching my bag for a moment? I'll be right back.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: Sure, whatever.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAYID: Thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 BOONE:  I couldn't get us into first class.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: Why not?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 BOONE: Um, maybe you shouldn't have yelled at the gate agent.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: What? You're on his side, now?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 BOONE: One day you're going to appreciate everything I do for you.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: Yeah, I can't wait for that day.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: You can try again with the gate agent.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 BOONE: Would you let it go?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: Excuse me for not being pathetic enough to not want to sit next to some crying baby for the next 15 hours.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 BOONE: Oh god, you can be a bitch.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: Oh, you want to play? I will get you thrown off this flight.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 BOONE: Yeah, how are you going to do that?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: I can do whatever I want. I could tell them...
Lost.Season01.Episode23 BOONE: Tell them what? Who's going to believe you? You're not even capable of...
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: You have no idea what I'm capable of.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: Excuse me, sir?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 AIRPORT COP: Yes, ma'am.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: Hi, um, some Arab guy just left his bags in the chairs downstairs and then just walked away.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 AIRPORT COP: Can you describe him, please?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SHANNON: Um, Arab? He went towards the shops.  How's that?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAYID: I salvaged a few things for you from the Beechcraft. This is the plane's radar emitter. It needs to be mounted on the mast or the top of the cabin.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAWYER: I'll do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SAYID: Michael, to conserve power, turn it on only once every hour or so. It will show you any ships within the horizon line, approximately 25 miles. The same with the radio transmitter.  This was in the plane's toolbox. There's only one flare. Choose wisely when you use it.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 LOCKE: Why are we stopping?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 DANIELLE: Because we're here. This is the Black Rock.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN: 왜 이렇게 오래 걸렸어? 배고파 죽겠는데. 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SUN: 사람들이 너무 많아서. 먹을게 별로 없어서 그냥 간단한 걸로 사왔어요.   Here.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 GINA:  If you ever catch me doing anything like that for you, shoot me.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JEFF: Don't knock it. Their divorce rate's 20 times lower than ours.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SUN: 여기요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN: 아, 뜨거워!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SUN: 어머, 어떡해! 어떡해, 미안해요. 뜨겁죠?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN: 됐어, 됐어. 화장실... 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SUN:  저기 있네요.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 GINA: My god, it's "Memoirs of a Geisha" come to life.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JEFF: Hey, volume.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 GINA: Relax, they don't speak English.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SUN: 진수씨.  이거요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN:  Star... star board.
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SUN: Starboard. 간단한 영어를 발음대로 적었어요. 당신한테 도움이 될 것 같아서 한번 만들어 봤어요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN: 정말 미안하다... 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SUN: 저도요. 당신이 꼭 갈 필요는 없잖아요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN: 아직도 모르겠어? 난 지금 벌을 받고 있는 중이야. 나 때문에 얼마나 고생했는지 잘 알고 있어. 당신 같은 여자가 왜 이 고생을 해야돼? 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SUN: 여보... 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN: 아니, 내가 가야만 당신을 구할 수 있어. 잭이 지켜 줄 거야. 잭이랑 같이 있어. 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SUN: 그럼 당신은... 당신은 누가 지켜줄 거에요? 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SUN: 사랑해. 사랑해. 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 JIN: 정말 미안해. 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 SUN: 괜찮아요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL: Go, go, go!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: Bye Vincent, bye Vincent!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: Stay, Vincent! Go back, Vincent! Vincent, go back, go back!
Lost.Season01.Episode23 MICHAEL:  What'd I say?
Lost.Season01.Episode23 WALT: We did it!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Claire, everybody's leaving.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: Okay, well, I can't go anywhere, alright? I've got the baby, and I'm so tired, I can't carry him -- now he's wet, there's sand everywhere, I don't have anymore nappies.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE:  Why don't you let me help.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE:  No, nobody ever taught me how to do this, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Claire, it's going to be okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: Oh, why do people keep telling me that? Are they the ones with the baby?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: We've got to get there before sundown. Once you reach the caves, stay there. The rest of us will be right behind you.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Sayid. I need a gun. Look, I know Jack gave them to you. I want one right now. I have to protect Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Rousseau said the Others wouldn't be here until nightfall.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Rousseau is certifiable. What if they show up before then and-
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: The last time you handled a sidearm-
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: I killed a murderer. I did us all a favor.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Charlie, you're emotionally involved. Let me handle the weapons.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: But you're not here all the time. You can't protect Claire. Look, I need a gun!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: If you really want to help Claire, get her packed, carry her child to the caves. That's what she needs.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: How exactly does something like this happen?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: Are you on the same Island as I am?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: I guess that explains it.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 ARZT: Hold on, wait, hold on. Hold, wait. What are we a couple miles inland?  A tsunami probably swept it here, huh, right?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK:  Hey, hey, where are you going?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: Explosives are in the hold of the ship.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Rousseau, wait.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: I did what you asked. You need dynamite, you don't need me. 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Let her go, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Who's going to lead us back?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: I'll lead us back.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Damn it. You heard her -- the explosives are in the hold. Let's go.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 ARZT: Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on. I came here to tell you how to handle dynamite, not explore some ghost ship, you think I'm go-
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Alright, just stay out here.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Uh, I'm going to stay out here and hang with Arnzt.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Slaves.  This ship must have been in route to a mining colony -- probably set off from the eastern coast of Africa -- Mozambique.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Jack, John, over here.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 ARZT: And then my 3rd wife, she says, get this, she says, "I didn't sign up for this." Now you tell me, what the hell is that even supposed to mean?  What, am -- am I boring you?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 ARZT: You know what? I'm -- I'm sorry, I'm so... I'm sorry that I'm not cool enough to be part of your merry little band of adventurers.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 ARZT: I know a clique when I see it. I teach high school, pal-y. You know, you people think you're the only ones on this Island doing anything of value. I've got news for you. There were 40 other survivors of this plane crash. And we are all people, too.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: O-kay.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: You know what? We could probably get it open if I just-
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: No, no, no, we should take it outside.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Why? We don't even know if it's...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: You're not prying open a crate that says explosives on the side with a pick axe, Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Yeah, I agree with Jack -- take it outside, open it there.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE:  Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: I got it. You mind showing us the way?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 ARZT: And it's not just the teenagers, either. You know, the gym teachers -- you think they let me sit with them in the cafeteria? No. They do not.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Dude, this is all in your head.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 ARZT: Really? Then you explain to me why Kate gets the best pieces of wreckage to build her shelter? And the Korean guy? Does he catch fish for everybody on the Island? No, he does not. He doesn't. And some of us have actually lost weight while we were here. Now, would mind telling me where you're hiding the carbs because I can't figure...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 ARZT: What the hell are you people doing?! Wait, wait, stop, stop, right where you are. Alright, I want you to put that down carefully. Put it down carefully. Put it gently, gently. Damn it, carefully, gently, gently. Alright, now get out of there. Come away from there. C'mon, get out. Move away from it.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 ARZT: Shhh. Be quiet. Do any of you have any idea what happens to dynamite in 90+ degree heat, huh?  So you know? Any of you? It sweats nitroglycerin.  Whoa, hey, what you doing? Did I ask you to come closer?  Dynamite is nitroglycerin stabilized by clay. Nitroglycerin is the most dangerous and unstable explosive known to man. Hey, Kate give me your shirt. Now, princess, give me your shirt. I need to wrap the dynamite. Just throw it to me, right here. Be careful, c'mon, hurry up.  Okay, good, now back up, back up, back up. Just back up. Get out of my way. Any of you ever hear about the guy who invented nitroglycerin? Probably not -- because he blew his freaking face off.  His lab assistant came into the room, saw that his mentor detonated, and he said, "Huh, I guess this stuff does work." Alright, we're not going to take any more of this stuff than we need because nitroglycerin is extremely temperamental, so we-
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Dude.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN:  반으로 자를까요?   여기요.   어머 어떡해 미안해 미안, 뜨겁죠? 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: 괜찮아, 괜찮아. 됐어. 화장실이 어디 있어? 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN: 저쪽... 저쪽에 있네요. 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 AIRPORT COP: Sorry for the inconvenience.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: I'm sure you are.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 AIRPORT COP: Sir, your bag was unattended.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Am I free to go?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 AIRPORT COP: Yes, sir.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Good, I have a plane to catch.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HAWAIIAN SHIRT: Hey, could you hand me a paper towel there, bud? A paper towel -- this one's broken.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HAWAIIAN SHIRT: Oh, oh, you don't speak English. Sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HAWAIIAN SHIRT: 아, 페이퍼 타올이 여기 있네. 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: 뭐라고요? 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HAWAIIAN SHIRT: 자네의 장인이신 백 회장님 밑에서 일하고 있지. 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: 여태까지 날 미행한거야? 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HAWAIIAN SHIRT: 물론. 그리고 자네가 도망가려는 것도 알고 있지. 자네는 남은 시계를 캘리포니아에 있는 백 회장님 친구에게 전하라고. 만약 그렇게 못하면 자네는 그녀를 잃게 되겠지. 넌 자유의 몸의 아니야. 여태까지 그래왔고 앞으로도 계속. 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Dad, look!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: How does a place this big never get discovered?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Don't know, but you could build yourself one hell of a beach resort right over there.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Yeah, you build your resort. I'm happy to say goodbye to this place forever.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: What about everybody else? Think they'll be okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: I hope so, buddy. At least until we can get them some help.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER:  Redemption song is all I'll ever have...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: You singing Bob Marley?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: No. Why, you like Bob Marley?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Man, who doesn't like Bob Marley?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SHANNON: Damn it!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Do you really need all that?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SHANNON: Yeah, I do.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Why do you have to bring so much?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SHANNON: Don't you have a hike to lead?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SHANNON: I'm fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: These belong to your brother.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SHANNON: I need these things. I can't just leave them. What are we doing? Hiding? As if they won't find us. It's just -- it's too much. It's too much.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID:  It won't be too much if I carry it for you. Now come on, I have a hike to lead.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: You okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: That was messed up.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: He just...exploded in front of us. He was just trying to help. This is because I came.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: I'm kind of bad luck.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Hey, it was an accident.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: An accident, yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Locke, we should think about this.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Maybe this isn't the best way.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: It's the only way, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: How many do we need to blow the Hatch?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE:  Two should take care of the hinge, three to be safe.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Safe?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: I'm removing the driest pieces to minimize our risk transporting it.  You ever play "Operation"?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Sure. Don't touch the sides.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: I -- I always got nailed on the funny bone.  Bzzzt!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK:  You like to play games, John?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Absolutely.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Okay, I know we're in a rush to escape to the caves, so I solved the turniphead transport issue. This is just a blanket from the plane. And then there's a piece of wood here that goes through this bamboo.  Here you go. It's a Bjorn.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: A bjorn?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Bjorn -- it's Dutch for baby carrier.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: Yeah, thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: That's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE:  Thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Oh, that's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: Thanks. I'll just put him in there.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: It's really...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE:  Sayid! Where is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Rousseau! What?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: Sayid? Where is he?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: He already left.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: I need him now.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Jack and Kate...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: There's no time. Where is Sayid?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Alright, just calm down, okay. I'll get him for you.  Stay here, alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE:  Sayid! Sayid!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: What happened out there?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE:  What is his name? The child. What is his name?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE:  Oh, I haven't named him yet.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: May I hold him?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: Why do you need Sayid?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: You don't want me to hold him.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: No, I just fed him. I don't think it's a good idea, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: Please.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: Why did I do that? Why did I scratch you?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY: What's going on?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: My flight, my flight to LA leaves in a couple of hours -- so I've got to get moving, you know. 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY: You want to do one more bump for the road?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE:  It's all gone. We did it all last night. I have some champagne.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY:  You've got to have some left.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Mm-mm. No. It's done. I'll look you up next time I'm in Sydney, okay? I'll send you an autographed copy of my CD and then you can listen to it whenever you want.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY: I don't want your piece of crap CD from your piece of crap band.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Last night in the bar you said you were a fan.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY: Fine. I'm a huge fan. Drivethru is the best damned band ever. Now just give me a bump because I know you've got some.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Shaft. Drive Shaft. 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY:  What's that in your hand?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Nothing.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY: Holding out on me?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Holding out on you? No, I'm not holding out...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY:  Give it to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Give you what? I'm not holding anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY: Give it to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: I've got nothing in my hand!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY: Give it to me!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY: Get up.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Get off.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY: Get up. Let it go. Let it go.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: What are you, crazy?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY: Let it go.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Get off!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY: Let it go!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Get off me.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LILY:  You're pathetic. You're pathetic.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE:  Sayid! Sayid, Rousseau's on the beach. She needs you.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Rousseau? What for?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN: Help! Someone! Help!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: My god!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: What happened?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN:  Her head.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: Where -- where is my baby?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Oh, my god.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: Is he alright?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Rousseau, was she alone?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: Did she take my baby? Did she take my baby?!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Claire, which way did she go?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: I don't know! She took my baby!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: This is your fault!  You brought her into the camp! If you had just given me a gun!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Do not hit me again. You want to waste time assigning blame? There's plenty to go around. She has a head start. If we leave now we can catch her.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: How are we going to do that?!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Because I know where she's going.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE:  I want my baby!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: We can carry all the sticks in my pack. The more insulation we stuff in the better.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: I think we should split them up.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: It's not smart to keep it all together. So, we split them up. If we need 3 sticks to blow the hinge then we should bring 6 -- 3 and 3 -- failsafe, in case one of us...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: You and me, then.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: No, I'm -- I'm taking one.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: It's not going to happen, no.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: This is why I came.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Then, you wasted a trip.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: I need to do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Kate, no one owes anyone anything.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: I'm carrying one.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: We're done here.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: This is not your decision.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Kate, yes it is.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: We'll draw straws. They're coming. We don't have time to argue about who gets to risk their life, so -- we'll let fate decide.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Works for me.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK:  What about you? You want to carry some dynamite, too?  What?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY:  You got some... Arnzt on you.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE:  Short sticks carry the packs.  Looks like it's me and you, Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: So, what's this stuff even do?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Well, the transmitter sends out an SOS in case someone's listening. And if there's anything out there, we'll see it on this radar screen here.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Here we go. C'mon, someone find us.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Those are the messages everybody wrote.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Sure are.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: They're private.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Yep. I, for one, never knew how much Tracy missed her hubby and 2 kids back in Fresno. Yet she's sleeping next to good old Scott to keep her warm at night.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: That's Steve. Scott's dead.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Whatever. It's alright, Kazoo, we've got to keep ourselves entertained. Who the hell is Hugo and how's he got a 160 million dollars to leave to his mom.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: How would you like it if I read yours?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: You can't read mine because I didn't write one.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Why not?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Because the only one I ever wrote is to the man I'm going to kill.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Why you going to kill him?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Because I need to.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Why?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Because!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Are you bloody joking?! Why would she go for the black smoke?! Isn't that where the Others are supposed to be?!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: The Others are precisely why she would go there. Rousseau told us she saw black smoke the day her own child was taken 16 years ago.  They took something from her, and now she believes she has something that they want.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: She's making a trade?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: I believe she is, yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: That's insane. She's insane.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Don't try to apply reason to her actions. She's a mother who lost her child, just like Claire.  This isn't about revenge. Don't make it personal.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: I'm coming with you.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: That's not a good idea, Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: This is my baby, okay?! I let her take him!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Hey, hey.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE:  Don't tell me what to do, okay!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Calm down!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: I am going to come with you! This is my fault and I'm coming and you can't stop me!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: It's alright, Claire.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE:  Get him back, Charlie. Get Aaron back.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Aaron?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: Please, get him back.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Claire, I will get him back. Promise.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Hey, you want something to eat?  I guess that's a no, then. If you're worried about Vincent, he going to be okay, man. Dogs fly in the luggage compartment all the time. -- Alright, I've got to call work, right over there. Don't go anywhere, okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: No, I live in a studio apartment. I've got to be out the door in the morning for work by 5am. Who's going to watch him? How's he going to get to school? What's he going to do after school? I can't do this, ma. -- You know, I was -- listen, I was thinking -- I was thinking maybe you could take him. -- Look, ma, if it's a question of money, I...  What am I supposed to do with him?! He's not supposed to be mine! He was never part of the plan. Yeah, I -- thanks a lot.  Hey, man, I was, uh...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: I need new batteries.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL:  Hey, want to try?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: C'mon, come here. You drive for a while.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Really?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Absolutely. Okay now, look, the most important part of this boat is the rudder. It's how you steer. You turn it gradually -- nothing sharp, okay. Push it this way.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Where are we going?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Look,  so, we're going approximately North by Northeast. So, hopefully that puts us into a shipping lane, or we hit some land.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: What do I aim for?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: See that cloud on the horizon, right there?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: You aim for that.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Yep.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Got it. -- How come you and my mom didn't stay together?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: We tried. It just didn't work out, so -- our lives, our interests -- we just went in different directions.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: How come I never saw you?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Because your Mom didn't want me to. She did what she thought was best for you.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: She was wrong.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: Rudder!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Hey, we hit a log! We lost the rudder.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: Rudder! Rudder!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: We're losing it! It's sinking!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Stop the boat. Stop the boat. Just pull the sail down. Right.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Dad!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Sawyer! Sawyer!  Give me the rope.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN:  Rope!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Sawyer!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER:  It's sinking!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: I can't reach it!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: 다시 던져봐.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Got it?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: 먼저 묶고!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Tie it around the rudder, we'll pull you in!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL:  C'mon, buddy. You just saved our asses, buddy.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL:  Here's your shirt. You should put that back on before you burn.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Sorry.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Yeah, well, luck of the draw.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: The sun sets in 90 minutes, give or take. If we want to get back to the Hatch we're going to have to hustle.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Okay, this is how we do this. I'll lead -- Kate, you're right behind me, then Hurley. John, you bring up the rear. If you start to see me heading the wrong way-
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: We should stagger our formation -- keep a safe distance from each other.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Alright, we stagger. If anyone hears anything or sees anything...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Like the security system that eats people?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Yeah, like that. You two, you take your packs off, you put them down and you run. You got it?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Got it.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Yes, sir.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Okay, let's do this.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN:  He died bravely.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SHANNON: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN: Your brother.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SHANNON: Yeah. Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN: Do you think all this -- all we've been through -- do you think we're being punished?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SHANNON: Punished for what?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN: Things we did before -- the secrets we kept, the lies we told.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SHANNON: Who do you think is punishing us?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN: Fate.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: No one's punishing us. There's no such thing as fate.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Are you okay?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: I'm fine, keep going.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: We're losing the light. Try to keep up.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: I'm coming.  Sayid! Sayid! -- Sayid!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID:  Over here.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Sayid?!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID:  You can barely breathe. We're going to rest.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Rest? She's out there right now...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: In another mile you're going to collapse. We're going to take a break.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Is this where Boone fell?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: The plane was up there.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Where did it come from?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Based on the maps inside -- Nigeria.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Anyone on board?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Two men dressed as priests.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Priests?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Drug runners in disguise.  The plane was loaded with heroin.  Alright, now we go.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: So, dude? What do you think is inside of that hatch thing?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: What do you think is inside it?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Stacks of TV dinners from the 50's, or something. And TVs with cable, some cell phones, clean socks, soap, Twinkies -- you know, for dessert, after the TV dinners. Twinkies keep for, like, 8000 years, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE:  I like Twinkies, too.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: C'mon, really, what do you think is inside?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Hope. I think hope's inside.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Whoever named this place Dark Territory? Genius.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Yeah, I saw it. We've got to get out of here.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Locke! What are you doing?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Locke!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Locke!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Jack! Jack!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Oh, my god.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: I need the dynamite.  No, no, it's in my pack. Just go get it! Hurry, go! John, John.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Let me go. Just let me go. I'll be alright. 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: No!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Let me go. I'll be alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE:  Hang on. I've got it.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Careful unwrapping it.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Alright.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Now throw it in.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: No!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: It'll blow us up.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Just hurry, I can't hold him!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Don't do this, Kate!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Throw it in -- now, Kate!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL:  Hey, your wife -- wife made this for you?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: Sun.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: She sounded it out, huh -- so you could learn English?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: Yes.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Yeah, I wish she had made one for me. So what words are in here? English words -- what can you say?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: Ah, starboard, aft, port, sail, eat.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL:  Yeah, right. She did you well. I hope you know how lucky you are, man.  Back in business? Alrighty.  Oh, hey, it's yours.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN:  You.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN:  You.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Um, thank -- you. Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN: I made you some tea.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE:  I'm fine.  Thanks.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN: Aaron is a beautiful name. What does it mean?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: I don't know what Aaron means.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN: They will bring him back.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: Don't say that.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN: They will.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CLAIRE: How do you know that?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SUN: Because he said he would. Charlie will bring your baby back.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: There!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Charlie, wait.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Charlie! See, let me see. 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: It's bleeding.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: We need to put pressure on it.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Okay. Ow.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID:  There.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Ow. Animal, what is she...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Keep the pressure on, like this.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Ow! Ow! Ow!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: She's been here for 16 years. She's learned how to set traps quickly. Okay, let's have a look. It's too deep. It's bleeding too much. You're going to have to go back.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: No, I'm not going back! You're going to have to fix it.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: I'm not a doctor.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: You're a soldier! What do people do when you get wounded?! I'm not going back without that baby, Sayid.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Don't move. 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Gunpowder?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Remove the towel and tilt your head back. Remove the towel.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: This is because I hit you, isn't it?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID:  This is not going to be pleasant. You ready?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Yeah.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: 1-2-3.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Oh, man.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY:  I need my car. 20 minutes? Look, I can't miss my flight. My mom's birthday is tomorrow.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: Some of us have a bloody flight to make!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY:  Excuse me, coming through. Excuse me.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: No, no, no!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY:  Excuse me, coming through, excuse me, excuse me. Look out, excuse me.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Any way we can hurry that up? My mom's birthday is tomorrow. Or, today -- I don't know. I don't really get the whole time change thing, but I've got to make that flight.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 TICKET AGENT: I am going as fast as the system will allow me, dear. You're confirmed for seat 20G. However, the airline has a policy that a man of your size must purchase two tickets.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: What? I didn't have to do that on the flight out here.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 TICKET AGENT: Am I going to have to weigh you, dear?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Fine, whatever. I'll buy the one next to it.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 TICKET AGENT: Alrighty. Here are two together.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Book it.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 TICKET AGENT: Uh-oh.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Uh-oh, what uh-oh?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 TICKET AGENT: It appears that your flight is already boarding in the Oceanic international terminal. Well, this is the domestic terminal. I don't think you're meant to make this flight, dear.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Excuse me, sorry. Sorry, this is an emergency. I've got to cut through. Excuse me, dude. Dude?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SECURITY AGENT: Back of the line.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: You've got to let me in. No, you don't understand...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SECURITY AGENT: Back of the line.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: This is...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SECURITY AGENT: Back of the line.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SECURITY AGENT: Next.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 ARZT:  Now? You're taking the computer out now?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Hey, old guy! I'll give you 500 bucks to borrow your scooter.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 OLD SCOOTER MAN: I just had a hip replacement. I need this thing.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Okay, 1600 bucks.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Hey, hold it! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! I've got to get on this flight!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 GATE AGENT: Sir, the jetway's closed.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Please, for the love of all that is good and holy in the world, let me on this plane.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 GATE AGENT: Alright, one second.  Hunter, this is Jenna, we've got one more... ta.  This is your lucky day.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY:  15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16, 23, 4-2, 4; 15, 16... 
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: You say something?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Nope.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: I thought I heard 23.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Does that mean something to you?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: That number? 23?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: The guy who called the Feds on me, back in Australia, did it for a 23,000 dollar reward. Mean something to you?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Nah, it's just a number. We better catch up -- can barely see them.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: We shouldn't be this close to each other, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: If we blow up, we blow up. What the hell was all that about back there, John?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: What was what about?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: You asked me to let you go.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: That's right.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: That thing was taking you down the hole and you asked me to let you go.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: It wasn't going to hurt me.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: No, John, it was going to kill you.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: I seriously doubt that.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Look, I need for you -- I need for you to explain to me what the hell's going on inside your head, John. I need to know why you believe that that thing wasn't gonna-
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: I believe that I was being tested.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Tested?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Yeah, tested. I think that's why you and I don't see eye-to-eye sometimes, Jack -- because you're a man of science.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Yeah, and what does that make you?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Me, well, I'm a man of faith. Do you really think all this is an accident -- that we, a group of strangers survived, many of us with just superficial injuries? Do you think we crashed on this place by coincidence -- especially, this place? We were brought here for a purpose, for a reason, all of us. Each one of us was brought here for a reason.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Brought here? And who brought us here, John?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: The Island. The Island brought us here. This is no ordinary place, you've seen that, I know you have. But the Island chose you, too, Jack. It's destiny.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Did you talk with Boone about destiny, John?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Boone was a sacrifice that the Island demanded. What happened to him at that plane was a part of a chain of events that led us here -- that led us down a path -- that led you and me to this day, to right now.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: And where does that path end, John?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: The path ends at the Hatch. The Hatch, Jack -- all of it -- all of it happened so that we could open the Hatch.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: No, no, we're opening the Hatch so that we can survive.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Survival is all relative, Jack.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: I don't believe in destiny.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Yes, you do. You just don't know it yet.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: I turned it on a little while ago.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Sayid said every hour.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Look, we're 15 miles out. We could be here for weeks. If that battery runs out...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: The man said every hour.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Nothing.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: 5 minutes, no more.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Aye, aye. You know what I like about you, Mike? You've got the patience of a saint.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Yeah? Why do you say that?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: I've seen the way he talks to you -- the way he runs around, does whatever the hell he wants. I'd have showed him the back of my hand a long time ago.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: You would, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: A hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Is that what your father did to you? Show you the back of his hand?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: My daddy never got a chance to beat me. He shot himself when I was 8.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Is that why you want to die, man?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Since the day you told me you wanted on this raft, I couldn't figure it out. Why does a guy who only cares about himself want to risk his life to save everyone else? The way I see it, there's only two choices -- you're either a hero or you want to die.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Well, I ain't no hero, Mike.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Is that what I think it is?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Something's out there.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 GATE AGENT: I'm sorry, sir, but the special wheelchair that we use for loading the disabled passengers -- well, no one seems to know where it is right now. And unless we find it, I'm not sure we can get you on.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: There's not another flight until tomorrow.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 GATE AGENT: Yes, I'm aware of that, sir, but there's nothing I can...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JD: Look, I can get Michelle, we can carry him on. Would you mind if we carry you on?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: No, that'll be fine.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHELLE: Here we go. Here's your seat.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JD: I'll get your bag, sir.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHELLE: If you need anything just press the call button.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Okay. Thank you.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Hugo, take these extra sticks back a couple hundred yards.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Me? Oh, okay. Got it.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK:  Be careful.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Can I have the flashlight? Because, uh, the torch with the dynamite thing, not making a whole lot of sense to me.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Kate, you run the fuse, Jack and I will rig the charges.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: What the hell is that?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: There's no footprints, no tracks.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: This is it? This is the black smoke? Where are they?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: I don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE:  She's here.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Danielle!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: You come out, right now!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Calm down.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Danielle! I can hear you, come out. Please, he needs his mother.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: They were not here.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: Danielle, you have to give us the baby.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: I just wanted my Alex back. I thought if I gave them the baby...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAYID: It's okay. I know. It's okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: I've got him. There never were any Others. You started the fires yourself!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: No, I heard them whispering.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: You're a nut job. You heard nothing!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 DANIELLE: I heard them say they were coming for the child. The Others said they were coming for the boy.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 CHARLIE: You're pathetic.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Wire. Hold that end. Now the fuse.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: I'll do it.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: This is as far as it goes.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: It's far enough. I'll light it. You take cover, there'll be enough burn time for me to get clear.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Hurley!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY:  Wait just a sec.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: So, what was that about back there?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: What was what about?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: Putting the dynamite in your pack.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: I made a judgment call.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: We drew straws.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Sorry, I'm not going to let drawing straws make decisions like that for us, Kate.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: You had no right to make that choice...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Everybody wants me to be a leader until I make a decision that they don't like. You want to keep second guessing me, Kate? That's your call. There's something that you need to know -- if we survive this, if we survive tonight -- we're going to have a Locke problem. And I have to know that you've got my back.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 KATE: I've got your back.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 LOCKE: Are we ready?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: Wait a sec, wait a sec.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY:  No. No, no, no. Stop! Stop, we can't do this! Stop! Wait! Stop we can't do this! Stop! Stop it! We can't! Stop! Don't light it! We can't do this! We can't do this! Stop! Wait! You've got to stop it!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: The Numbers are bad! Stop! What are you doing?! Why did you do that?!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: The Numbers are bad! The Numbers are bad!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Hurley! Hurley stop!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 HURLEY: The Numbers are bad!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JACK: Hurley! Hurley, you've got to get back!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: It's closer. It's closer. Give me the damn flare gun.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Hold on a sec.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: I'm telling you, it's closer. I'm telling you, look.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: I know, okay. I've got one flare.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: 아무 것도 안 보여.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL:  Okay, I know. You don't see anything. Okay.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: What the hell are you expecting to see?! In case you haven't noticed, it's dark!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: What is it? Is it a ship?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: We don't know, little man. We don't know.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: Starboard? Port?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Uh, Port. Port.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 JIN: 반대로 가는데?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Okay, what the hell am I supposed to do about it?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Hey, Han, you and Chewie want to slow down a second and talk to me here?! We have to fire the flare.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: We don't know what it is. It could be anything -- a piece of floating junk. We don't even know if Sayid's radar works!!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Have you ever known that guy to fix something up that don't work?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: It's moving away.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Floating junk that knows how to steer, huh?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: We're moving! It doesn't make-
Lost.Season01.Episode24 SAWYER: Look, are you going to give me the damn gun, or am I going to have to take it?!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: It's almost gone. -- C'mon.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Please, god.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: It's coming back! It's coming back!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Are we glad to see you!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 BEARDED MAN: What's going on?! What are you folks doing this far out here?!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: We were, we were -- the plane crashed! We were on the Island for a month, man!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 BEARDED MAN: Plane crash, huh? Well, how about that?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: We were on an Island -- oh, flight 815 -- hey, where are we?!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 BEARDED MAN: Well, it's a good thing we found you.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, we survived and there's a whole group of people on the...
Lost.Season01.Episode24 BEARDED MAN: Well, ain't that something?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Yeah!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 BEARDED MAN: Only, the thing is, we're going to have to take the boy.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: What? What'd you say?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 BEARDED MAN: The boy, we're going to have to take him.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Hey, what the hell's going on here? Who are you people?
Lost.Season01.Episode24 BEARDED MAN: Just give us the boy.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: I'm not giving you anybody.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 BEARDED MAN: Well, alright then.
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Dad! Dad!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: No!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Help me!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Walt!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 WALT: Help me! Dad! Please!
Lost.Season01.Episode24 MICHAEL: Waaaaaaaaaaalt! Waaaahahahaaalt! No! Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. 4, 8, we're dead, 15, doomed and dead, 16, 23, 42...
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: Hurley, you okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: Huh? Yeah, awesome. I just have to pee.  Great idea, dude, go look into the burning death hole.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: What is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: It doesn't matter what it is. We blew the door so we could get everyone inside this thing so we could be safe. That plan is not going to work. We'll never get everyone down in time.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: Water.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: It's shallow. It sounds like a puddle.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: 40 feet down?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: 50 tops. If we could use the wire we pulled from the fuselage -- rig up a harness...
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: John, we're leaving now.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: Yes, good idea. Let's do that.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: We all went through a lot to get here, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: The ladder's broken. You going to lower 40 people down there one by one? They're waiting for us to come back and tell them what to do, so let's forget about the harnesses.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Why don't we all just calm down here.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Look, if you want to go exploring in the morning that's fine, but tonight we're done. I'm going to go get the dynamite that we didn't use and we're heading back to the caves. How about you pack it up, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Sure, of course.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Why don't you want to go down there, Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 EMT: Female, late 20's, no ID, she coded twice on the way over here.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 NURSE: Where's the other one?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 EMT: Right behind us. They're on their way -- Fire Department had to use the jaws.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 INTERN: What do we got here?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 NURSE: Female, late 20s...
Lost.Season02.Episode01 INTERN:  What the hell is that?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK:  Piece of the steering column. All right, let's go. Keep that collar steady. Page my father.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 INTERN: Already did.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK:  Tell me.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 EMT: Her tire blew, car jumped the divider, went head-on with an SUV.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 NURSE: BP's dropping.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Pericardial's pierced. Was she driving?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 EMT: Yes, alone.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Where's the driver of the SUV?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 EMT #2: Adam Rutherford, 57, chest trauma, no breath sounds.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK:  Tube Mr. Rutherford while I...
Lost.Season02.Episode01 INTERN: I can't intubate, you've got to.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 NURSE: Dr. Shephard, her BP's 80 over 60.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 NURSE #2: Dr. Shephard, his breathing's deteriorating.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK:  Okay, need a syringe -- big one. You, hold pressure. 
Lost.Season02.Episode01 NURSE: 88 over 52, no radial pulse.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I know. I know -- sac's flooded. Where's that...
Lost.Season02.Episode01 NURSE:  Right here. Got it?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Yep.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 NURSE #2: Doctor, we're losing him.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 NURSE: BP stabilizing.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 NURSE #2: Time of death 8:15am.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Okay, get me a blood gas and a C-spine. Get her up to ICU and keep her immobilized.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH:  I want to dance at my wedding.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 INTERN: Did you hear that?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 NURSE: Sweetie, you need to take it easy, okay. Just relax.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 INTERN: What did she say?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: She said she has to dance at her wedding.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHARLIE: Okay, no one is out there. No one is coming.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 N.D. Survivor: But the -- but the French woman said...
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHARLIE: The French woman is missing a bloody wing nut, you know. I mean, I mean, it was all bollocks. It's a ghost story. She set the fire herself.  What?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SAYID: Nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON:  Has anyone seen Vincent -- the dog? Anyone seen him? Has anyone seen the dog?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 REDSHIRT: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SAYID: Where are you going?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: I lost the damn dog.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: Why'd you do that? Why'd you light the fuse, man?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Why wouldn't I light the fuse?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: Ah, maybe because I was running towards you, waving my arms, yelling "don't do that?"
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE:  Well, you've got a point there. I guess I was just excited to get inside. I mean, that's why we came here, isn't it? That's why we went all the way out to the Black Rock -- and why we got the dynamite to blow the hatch. And we did it so that we could get inside, Hugo.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: And to save everybody's lives.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: And to save everyone's lives.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Or, maybe it was just our destiny, right, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Maybe.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: Guys, it's the hatch door, you'd better see this.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: Vincent!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SAYID: This is not a good idea.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: I saw him 5 minutes ago. Besides, you're the one who said there isn't anyone out here.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SAYID: I said we didn't see anyone. The dog will come back on his own. He always does.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: Watching that dog was the one thing anyone has ever asked me to do. If something happens to him...
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SAYID: When was the last time you slept or had something to eat? You're exhausted.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: I can't tell that kid that I lost his dog because I was exhausted.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SAYID: I'll circle around behind him.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SAYID: Vincent!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: Sayid!  Sayid! Sayid, where are you?! Sayid! Sayid!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: Walt?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SAYID: Shannon! What is it? What?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: Why do you want to get down there so bad?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: -ly. Why do I want to get down there so badly. Jack thinks I'm crazy, doesn't he?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: Why, because you want to drop into a hatch that's been locked from the inside by a foot-thick steel door that says "quarantine?"
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Well, look at the bright side. The damage is done.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: The bright side?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: And if Jack thinks I've lost it, I can't blame him, really. Then again, 5 hours ago I was pulled into a hole by what appeared to be a column of black smoke. Did you see it, Kate?  Then I guess we're both crazy. Wonder what Jack thinks he saw?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: You should go ahead, man -- don't want Locke making time with your girl.  Joke, dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I'm not really in the mood, Hurley.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: Really? Wow, usually you're, like, Mr. Haha.  There you go. Life's not so bad, right? I mean, sure the Others are coming to, like, eat us all -- and every once in a while someone blows up all over you, but you do get to sleep in every morning.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Uh-huh. And the numbers?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: "The numbers are bad" -- that's what you were yelling right when I tackled you.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: Yeah, that's kind of a long story.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I've got time.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: You'll think I'm crazy.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Try me.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: Awhile ago I was in this kind of psych ward, and there was this guy, Leonard -- and all the time I knew him all he ever said were these numbers -- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 -- over and over and over again. And they kind of got stuck in my head. So, when I got out -- well, actually a couple of months after I got out -- I was buying a frozen burrito and I thought, hey, I should play the lottery. And I guess those numbers were still stuck in my head so I played them. And I won 114 million dollars. That's when it started happening -- my grandpa died, my house caught on fire, the chicken joint that I worked at got hit by a meteor -- well, actually meteorite. Okay, so tonight I see the same freaking numbers on the hatch thing -- just written on the side -- and that's why I tried to stop it -- because that thing is cursed, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: You were in a psych ward?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: I'm not crazy.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I'm not saying you are.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: So, what? That's it? That's all?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: What do you want me to say?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: How about you believe me, man?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Hurley, they're numbers.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: What's that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Bedside manner.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: Yeah, that. Yours sucks, dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: What happened to him?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Just try to relax, okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: The car that I hit -- the other driver was older.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: He died in the ER.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: I can't feel anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I know.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: What's happened to me?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: You have a fracture-dislocation of your thoracic lumbar spine with multiple crushed vertebrae -- your back is broken. Your spleen is ruptured and bleeding into your abdomen and that has to be stopped.  I'm going to perform surgery and repair as much damage as possible. But even the most optimistic result puts the likelihood of retaining any feeling or mobility anywhere below the waist at "extremely unlikely".
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: Oh.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Dr. Shephard, may I have a word, please.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: So, what did I do wrong?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: You did something wrong?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: You're frowning.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: My face is always this way.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Dad, hey, c'mon, let's hear it.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: You might want to try handing out some hope every once in awhile. Even if there's a 99 percent probability that they're utterly, hopelessly screwed, folks are much more inclined to hear that 1 percent chance that things are going to be okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Her spine's crushed. I tell her that everything's going to be okay -- that's false hope, dad.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Maybe. Maybe, but it's still hope.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: I know what I saw! It was him! It was Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SAYID: Shannon, please lower your voice. You'll upset the rest of the group.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: I heard whispers.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CLAIRE: Where?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: Everywhere.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHARLIE: What -- what whispers? Who?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: I don't know -- Them.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SUN: Do you think something happened to the raft?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SAYID: Nothing happened to the raft. Walt is with your husband, with Sawyer...
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: Sayid, I know what I saw.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHARLIE:  They're back.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Uh, Locke found, uh, a hatch in the ground about a half a mile from here. We left to -- to blow it open so that we could hide inside -- so all of us could hide inside, in case... But that doesn't matter now because it's not going to work. There's no way for all of us to get down in there tonight.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHARLIE: Jack, where's Dr. Arzt?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Um, he didn't make it.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: Did you see them? Did you see the Others?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHARLIE: Hey, Shannon, there are no Others. We've already had this conversation.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: What the hell would you know about it -- just because you didn't see anything?!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHARLIE: There's no one out there.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SHANNON: You don't know!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 CHARLIE: You're just making up rubbish!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Hey! Everything's going to be okay. Let's just take it easy. We're going to be alright. We're going to stay here tonight, okay, together. We've still got 4 guns. We'll put lookouts at all the entrances. We're all going to be safe as long as we stay together. The sun comes up in 3 hours and we're all going to be here to see that happen. I promise.  John, what are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: I'm getting some cable.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: What for?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: It's for the hatch. I'm going in.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Do you really think that's the smartest thing to do right now, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: I doubt it. In fact, you're right. The safest thing is to stay here -- wait for morning -- wait for these Others, to see if they ever show up -- wait for the brave folks on the raft to bring help -- but me, I'm tired of waiting. 
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: So, do you believe it?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Believe what?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: That everything's going to be okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Yeah, I do.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: Kind of unlike you -- the whole glass half-full thing.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: There's a glass?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: You did a good thing saying what you said -- taking care of everybody and just giving them something to count on. If you weren't here, Jack...  I'm going to the hatch. I understand why you can't go. They need you here. I get it. I do. But Locke's going into that thing whether you like it or not. And if he falls and breaks his neck... Live together, die alone, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Right.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Your fiance was seriously injured. It could take as long as 10, maybe 12 hours. I won't know how extensive the damage is until I get inside.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KEVIN: She was going for a dress fitting and to look at tablecloths.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: When is it -- the wedding?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KEVIN: It's 8 months.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Well, I'm sure Sarah will have recovered by then.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KEVIN: Recovered - um, what does that mean?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: There will be ongoing physical therapy, but if she works really hard...
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KEVIN: Well, well, will we be able to, you know, make love?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: You need to know that there's a chance Sarah might very well need professional care for the rest of her life.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KEVIN: Like, she won't be able to go to the bathroom by herself?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH:  Come here. Come here. I want to tell you a little secret. Come on. Closer. It's okay. I know I'm not going to be dancing anymore. I can still roll around at my wedding. And you're invited, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I'm going to fix you.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: I expected to find you half way down there by now.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: I was waiting for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: So, you want me to go down first?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Well, you're lighter. I can belay you down and bring you back up just as easy. The shaft might get narrower down there, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: You left out the part where you just want to see if I get eaten by something.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Yeah, well, that too.  Not too tight?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: Got it. -- Okay.  Wait, what do I say if I need to stop?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Stop.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: Hmm, okay. Let's go.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Kate, are you alright?!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: Yeah, I dropped the light! Maybe we should...  Well, okay then. 1, 2, 3, 4.  Stop!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: What is it?!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 KATE: John, I think there's something down here!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Kate, are you alright?!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Kate! Kate! Kate!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: You're kidding, right? You're going back?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK:  Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 HURLEY: What about all that stuff you said about waiting 'til morning and watching the sun rise?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I changed my mind.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Kate! Locke!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Ow, damn it.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: You alright, brother?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I'm fine. I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: Take it easy. Keep the weight off. Here, let me have a look. Does this hurt?  You haven't sprained it then. I don't fancy your chances of catching up with me tonight, though.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I wasn't trying to catch up.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: Aye, of course you weren't.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: What do you know about sprains, anyway?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: I was almost a doctor once.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Small world.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: You a doctor then?  So what's your excuse?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Excuse?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: For running like the devil's chasing you. My excuse - I'm training.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Training for what?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: For a race around the world. Impressive, I know. So your excuse better be good, brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Just trying to work a few things out.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: Ah, a girl, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: A patient.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: Ah, but a girl patient. What's her name?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Her name's Sarah.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: What'd you do to her then?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Do to her?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: You must have done something worthy of this self-flagellation.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I told her -- I made a promise I couldn't keep -- I told her I'd fix her and I couldn't. I failed.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: Well, right. Just one thing -- what if you did fix her?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I didn't.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: But what if you did?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: You don't know what you're talking about, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: I don't? Why not?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Because with her situation that would be a miracle, brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: Oh, and you don't believe in miracles?  Right. Well then, I'm going to give you some advice anyway. You have to lift it up. (He may be saying "lift her up".)
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Lift it up?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: Your ankle. You've got to keep it elevated. It's been nice chatting.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 DESMOND: Jack, I'm Desmond. Good luck, brother. See you in another life, yeah?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE:  I wouldn't do that, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK:  Where is Kate? What the hell did you...
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: Am I alive?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Yeah. Yeah, you're alive.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: You smell.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Well, thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: Wow, you really smell.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Yeah, I -- I went for a run.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: You smell like you ran far.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I showered. I mean, I guess I just didn't cool. I -- I wanted to get back down here and check on you. It was a Tour de Stade.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: It is when you run all the steps in every section of a stadium up and down.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: Why would you do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I'm -- I'm intense.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: Did you finish?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: No, I hurt my ankle.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: That sucks for you. Is Kevin here, my fiance?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I didn't see him.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: I'm, I'm sure he'll be back in awhile.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: You going to tell me how it went?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Sarah, the -- the damage to your back was extensive. I did everything I could but your spinal column... I just -- I couldn't repair it.  You're going to be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of your life. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Sarah.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: You're yanking my chain, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: Then how come I can wiggle my toes?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Can you feel this?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Can you feel this?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK:  This?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: This?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 SARAH: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 GUNMAN'S VOICE: Move and I kill him. Put the gun down.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Where's Kate?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Jack, it's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 GUNMAN'S VOICE: I said drop it!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Where's Kate?!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: She's fine, just put down the...
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: I'm not putting anything...
Lost.Season02.Episode01 GUNMAN'S VOICE:  Do you want him to die? Put it down.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK: Is this what you were talking about, Locke? Is this your destiny? All roads lead here?
Lost.Season02.Episode01 LOCKE: Jack, calm down.
Lost.Season02.Episode01 GUNMAN's VOICE:  Lower your gun or I'll blow his damned head off, brother!
Lost.Season02.Episode01 JACK:  You.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 WALT: Dad, please! Dad!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Walt! No! Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Mike!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JIN: Sawyer!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Jin!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JIN: 안 보여, 어딨어?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Walt! Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Hang on Mike! Hang on Mike! Hang on!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Mike! Mike!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Kate! Kate!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Where's Walt?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: I don't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Where is he?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: I don't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Where the hell is my son? Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: How'd you hurt your leg?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Got hit by a car.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: Ow.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: So, this is the paperwork your ex-wife sent over.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: She's not my ex-wife, man. She's just -- Walt's mother. She, uh, Susan, she just got an new job in Rome -- the boyfriend -- they want to take Walt with them.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: Don't worry, I'm going to take very good care of you, Mr. Dawn.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Dawson.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: Right, sorry, Dawson. So this boyfriend -- this is this guy Brian Porter?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Yeah, why, what's it say?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: It seems that Susan wants you to relinquish your rights as Walt's father so that Mr. Porter can adopt him.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: She wants me to sign my son away?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: It's the only way they can proceed with the adoption, yeah. Listen, if you sign this document -- legally, he'll be no different than any other kid you pass on the street. You'll be giving up your paternal rights -- all of them.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Yeah, so then, can I stop her from going?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: Well, I guess we could file an injunction so she couldn't leave the city, but-
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Yeah, that, that. I want to do that.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: Right. Um, Mr. Dawson, the fact that you came in through these doors -- that tells me something. It tells me that I'm the best that you can afford. If we go forward with this, it's going to take money. A lot of it, even at my rates. This is David and Goliath, so I've got to ask you -- are you sure you want to do this?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: They're not taking my son away.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Walt! Walt!  Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Mike, you should save your energy.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: They took my son!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Yeah, I saw that -- onto a boat which means he's not in shouting distance.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: You don't know that.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Well, I got a pretty good sense. And even if he was, there's nothing you can do.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: But if he can hear me, he knows that I'm alive -- that I'm coming for him -- that I'm going to get him back. Right now, all I've got is that maybe my son can hear me. Does that make any sense to you? Walt! Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Kate.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Kate.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 KATE: John.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Easy, easy, easy.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 KATE: Behind you.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Are you him? Are you him?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Jin! Jin! Jin!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: I thought we had to save our energy.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Yeah, well, Jin's still out there in the water, so if it's okay by you, I'm going to keep shouting for him. Jin!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Feeling guilty.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: You made me fire that flare.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: I made you fire -- what, this is my fault?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: They took my son. They found us -- took Walt -- because you made me fire the flare.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: At least Walt is on a boat -- probably wrapped in a blanket with a cup of cocoa -- while we're on this piece-
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Get off my raft.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: What the hell is that?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: I see you managed to hold on to your best friend there . That thing ain't going to work, anyway.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: It'll work.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: You were under water.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: What do you know about guns, anyway, Hoss? It'll work.  Bullets are dry, powder's dry -- if the powder's dry- 
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: What the hell is that?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: It's a shark. It's only a shark.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: It's only a shark? That's supposed to make me feel better? Well, I guess I know why the shark is hanging around -- your shoulder.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Oh, well, I'll just stop bleeding then. Did you suddenly forget what happened? Why I got shot?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Hey, how about a little gratitude here? I'm mean -- a thank you!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Thank you? For what? For you trying to save your own ass?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: You want me off this raft? You got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: I was trying to save your damn kid.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY:  Let's talk about Walt, shall we, Mr. Dawson?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Uh, sure, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: When was the last time you actually saw your son?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Um, about a year ago.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: It was 14 months, actually.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: Is that a question, Lizzy?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: Why is that Mr. Dawson? Why so long?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Susan took him to Amsterdam -- for work.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: And you didn't have a problem with that?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Excuse me?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: Well, since she's now going to Rome and you're filing an injunction. It just seems a little inconsistent to me.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Incon -- no. No, no, no, no.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: Michael, she's baiting - she's baiting you. Don't give her an answer.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: She took him, though. I didn't want her to go.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: Michael, please don't talk.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL:  You said there was nothing I could do.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: And you didn't do anything, did you?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: He's not going to answer that question.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: That's because there is no answer. You were in an accident recently, no?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: You had several surgeries, spent weeks in a private hospital room, extensive rehabilitation. Who paid for all of that, Mr. Dawson?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL:  I didn't ask you for anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY:  Could the record reflect that Mr. Dawson acknowledged that Ms. Lloyd paid his bills?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Susan! Tell them -- Susan, tell them that I didn't ask you for anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: Please don't address my client directly.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: But I didn't. 
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: Do you know what Walt's first words were, Mr. Dawson?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: I'm sorry, what?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: His first words, do you know what they were?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: I -- no, I -- I wasn't there.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: Do you know what his favorite food is?  Do you...
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: No!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 ATTORNEY: Okay, this is unnecessary.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: Well, for someone who wants to retain his paternal rights so badly you don't seem to know much about your son, Mr. Dawson.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: I'm his father.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LIZZY: I'm sorry, could you say that louder please -- just for the record.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: I'm his father.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Are you crazy? You're going to take a bullet out with your bare hands?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: You got a better idea?  Then go to hell.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: You're never going to be able to do it by yourself.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: I thought we parted ways, Mike.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: We're caught in the same current.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Still talking.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: You got a Band-aid?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Are you -- are you him?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Yes. Yes I am.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: I can't believe it. You're finally here.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Well, here I am.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Who's she?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: She's with me.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: What did one snowman say to the other snowman?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: I don't know what you're talking about.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Get rid of the knife. You're not him.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE:  We didn't come here to hurt you.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Yeah, then why did you come?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 KATE: We were in a plane crash.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Were you now? And when was that?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: 44 days ago.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: 44 days? Move.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: How long have you been down here?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Shut it.  Tie him up. Do it!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Wait. Wait, wait -- you're tying up the wrong person.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: How's that, brother?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: It's pointless to tie me up, I'm not dangerous. But her, she's a fugitive.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: So, what does that make you then, brother?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: I'm a regional collections manager for a cardboard manufacturer -- boxes primarily.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: All right then, box man, tie her up.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 KATE: Don't you dare touch me.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Hey! You be good girl, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 KATE: What do you think you're doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: I'm doing what's best for all of us.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Alright, bring her here.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 KATE:  Oh, hey, John, wait, hey. Wait!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 HURLEY: You're kidding, right? You're going back?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 HURLEY: What about all that stuff you said about waiting 'til morning and watching the sun rise?!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JACK: I changed my mind.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 CLAIRE: What do you suppose all that's about?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 CHARLIE: I reckon Jack's going to do something heroic.  What?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 CLAIRE: You always try to be funny when you don't want to answer a question.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 CHARLIE: Try to be funny?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 CLAIRE:  What's this?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 CHARLIE: Oh, I found it in the jungle.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 CLAIRE: You found it?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 CHARLIE: Yeah. Be careful. Be careful with it. Here, take Aaron.  You've got to be careful with it, you know. It's the Virgin Mary. She's holy.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 CLAIRE: I didn't realize you were so religious.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 CHARLIE: I'm not. It's just, you know, it might come in handy. It'd be a nice thing to have around.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: It wasn't the flare. I said it wasn't the flare. Those people that did this -- at first I thought they were fisherman or pirates or something. Then I got a good look at their boat. You know anything about boats, Mike? A boat like that wasn't built for the open ocean -- water's coming over the side with the first little squall -- maybe got a range of 100 miles. Nope, a boat like that had to have left port from somewhere close -- like the Island. French chick said the Others were coming for a kid. I think they came, Mike.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: He's the one they wanted -- why I got a bullet in my shoulder. Hell, Bluebeard blew us up because they wanted your kid.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Are you saying this is my fault?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: That's what I'm saying.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: They took my son because of you! They were sailing away!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: They found us because they were looking for us, for Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Don't you ever say his name again, ever!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Oh, what are you gonna do, splash me?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Look, I know you-
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Shut up! Don't even -- you have no idea what it's like to care for somebody else.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: Hi.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Where are your lawyers?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: Out. I told them I wanted to talk just you and me. But if you want yours I understand.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: No, it's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: I think you're going to win.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Excuse me?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: In court. I think you're going to keep me from leaving the country with Walt. I just have to ask you why?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Why what?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: Why are you doing this?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: He's my son.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: Since when, Michael? Look, I know you don't care about what's best for me, but in Rome I'll be senior partner at the firm. I'll be able to give Walt anything he needs. You're still on disability, Michael. You can't work. You're about to be evicted from your apartment.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: You got your lawyers checking up on me, now?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: Well, of course I did. Just like you had your lawyers checking up on me. Nobody's winning here.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Then stop.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: Michael, the first thing you need to do is take care of yourself. You need to get healthy. You need to get back on your feet financially so you can get back to pursuing your art. You have rare talent as an artist, Michael. But how are you going to do that -- any of that -- and still be a part of Walt's life?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: I do it by doing it. Walt is my responsibility, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: Then let him go because it's not about you or me -- it's about him. I don't want to go court, Michael. So please just let him go.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: The pilot said we had lost radio contact, but by then we were already a thousand miles off course. Any search teams would have given up weeks ago.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: So you were traveling from Sydney to Los Angeles?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: So the world is still out there?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: As far as I know. Could you tell me your name?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: My name? My name is Desmond.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Desmond, I'm John. You should know the gun is really unnecessary.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Yeah, so I should just hand it over to you then, should I? How many of you are there?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: 43, but 4 sailed out this morning on a raft.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: A raft?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: That simulated sunlight -- is that because you never leave? Is there another way out?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: How many of your group have gotten sick.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Sick?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Sick, as in ill, as in dead!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Is that why it says quarantine on the inside of the hatch...
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Answer the question.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: No one has. No one. No one is sick.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Get up.  Stand right there. Do you know how to use this, box man?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: I haven't seen one of those in 20 years.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Do you know how to use it?!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Sit!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Listen carefully, type in exactly what I tell you understand -- exactly, nothing else. 4, 8, 15... Did you hear that?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: What did you just put in? What number did you just put in?!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: 15
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Right, 16, 23, 42. Now press execute.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE:  What's going to happen?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Just push it!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JACK: Kate! Locke!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Who the hell is that?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: That would be Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Who is he?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: His, uh, his name is Jack. He's our doctor.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: What is he doing here?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: To be honest with you I'm a little surprised to see him.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Your doctor has a gun, brother.  Move.  Make one sound and I'll shoot. Move.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: I wouldn't do that, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JACK: Where's Kate? What the hell did you...
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND:  Move and I kill him. Put the gun down.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JACK: Where's Kate?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Jack, it's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: I said drop it.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JACK: Where's Kate?!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: She's fine. Just put down the...
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JACK: I'm not putting down anything!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND: Do you want him to die? Put it down.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JACK: Is this what you were talking about Locke? Is this your destiny? All roads lead here?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 LOCKE: Jack, calm down.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 DESMOND:  Lower your gun or I'll blow his damned head off, brother!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JACK: You.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: What the hell is that? Part of the raft -- one of the pontoons. Stop paddling. Hey stop it. You're putting a strain on the binds; it's going to break us up.  Damn it, you're going to...
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Hey Sawyer! Climb up.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: I do and we both sink. I'm going for the pontoon.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Don't be an idiot.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER:  You see that toothy son of a bitch, you aim and squeeze, got it?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Sawyer!  Sawyer! Sawyer!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Give me your hand.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN:  There he is, do you see him? Hi.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: Hey, I'm sorry I'm late -- packing's been a disaster and the plane leaves first thing in the morning.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Sure, no problem.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: Uh, you want to say hi, Walt?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Hi, Walt. I'm... hey, uh,  this is for you, man.  He like bears?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: Yes, sure, he's just really shy.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL:  Hey little man, look, I guess I can't call you that -- I mean, because look how big you are. So, you and I -- well, we're not going to see each other for a while, Walt. But you are going to have a great life. I know your mommy, she's going to take real good care of you. And Brian is going to take good care of you, too. But, you know what? I just want you to know that no matter where you go that I -- that your daddy -- yeah, your daddy -- he loves you very, very much. And I always will. Always, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: I'm sorry -- this...
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: It's okay. Uh, hey, here  -- just, you know -- you know, let him know it's from me -- sometime.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SUSAN: Okay. Goodbye, Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: Yeah, bye.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: You alright, Mike?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: It's my fault.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 MICHAEL: I never should have brought him on the raft. I'm going to get him back. I'm going to get back my son.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: How about that?  The current brought us back. We're home.
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Jin?
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JIN: Michael! Sawyer! 이 쪽으로 오면 안돼! 이 쪽으로 오면 안돼!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 SAWYER: Jin!
Lost.Season02.Episode02 JIN: 여기 있으면 안돼! 이쪽으로 오지 마! 이 쪽으로 오지 마! 돌아가야 돼! 말 좀 들어봐. 여기 있으면 안돼! 지금 오는 거야! 지금 오는 거야! Others. Others.  Others.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MICHAEL: Where's my boy? Where's my boy? Hey, what'd you do with my boy?! Do you hear me?! Come back here!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Do you want him to die? Put it down.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Is this what you were talking about, Locke? Is this your destiny? All roads lead here.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 FRANCINE: My mother stole again from me this week. Now, I don't even keep money in my purse anymore. I've been hiding it. But when she wants a drink -- she stole 30 dollars. I know it may not seem like a lot of money to some of you, but it's a lot to me. And I want it back.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MODERATOR: Something you want to say?  John, you've been coming here for a month now...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: I just don't think 30 dollars is worth getting angry about.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MODERATOR: Well, Francine feels like 30 dollars...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Francine feels a little too much, if you ask me. You all do. I mean, seriously -- so-and-so never called me back -- my mother stole 30 dollars from me. I never even knew who my parents were. A couple of years ago my -- my birth mother found me, and uh, she told me I was special. And -- and through her I met my real father. Great news, right?  Well, he pretended to love me just long enough to steal my kidney because he had to have a transplant. And then he dropped me back in the world like a piece of trash -- just like he did on the day that I was born.  You want your damned 30 dollars back?! I want my kidney back!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: Probably a good idea. You know if you get kidney cancer you've only got one.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: That's funny. I'm sorry if I ruined your meeting.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: Oh hell, you just said everything I've always wanted to say in there. Most of the time I want to stand up and scream: get over it, freaks.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Well, why don't you?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: I have to keep a cork in. Once I get all hot and bothered there's no stopping me. I guess you won't be coming back next week, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: No, not likely.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: Hmmm, that's too bad. I like bald guys.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: I'm not bald.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: I can wait. Um, I'm Helen, by the way.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Hi Helen, I'm John.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Where's Kate?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Lower your gun or I'll blow his damned head off.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Where's Kate?!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK:  Do not move.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Now, don't...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Don't what?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: He's unarmed.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: He just had a gun pointed at your head!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: What did you do? What did you do? We're all going to die. We're all going to die.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND:  I have to fix it.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: What the hell is he talking about?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Listen, if you do not let me up, we are going to die...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Stop moving or I swear to God...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Look at the wall! You see that?! That's a timer! It's counting down! I've got to enter the code! I've got to push the button!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Or what?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Jack, you should let him up.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Don't tell me what to do!  Or what? What's going to happen?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Do I know you?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK:  You got him?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Bastard.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Nothing, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: Hey. What are you doing? Where are you going?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Nowhere, I -- I -- I just have trouble sleeping in a strange bed.  No, it has nothing to do with you, Helen, I promise. I really like you. I'm sorry, I'll call you later.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 COOPER: Morning.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Morning.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 COOPER: John, I know you like to drive through my neighborhood. And I know that every now and then you like to park outside my house. Now, I thought it might all stop when I moved, but here you are. Now, I admit -- at first I thought it was funny -- now it's just annoying. So how about you tell me what the hell it is you want.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 COOPER: Excuse me?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 COOPER: There is no why. Do you think you're the first person that ever got conned? You needed a father figure and I needed a kidney, and that's what happened. Get over it. And John, don't come back. You're not wanted.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE:  I don't think you need that, Kate.  Whatever you're looking for, maybe I can help.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Can you fix a computer?  Then you can't help me, can you?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 KATE: Sayid can fix a computer.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Get him. Go and get Sayid.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Can you get back up that rope?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 KATE: I won't have to, there's got to be a front door in this place.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Down the corridor to the left. Be persistent, the wheel sticks.  Gotcha.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Now, you're going to tell me what's going on.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Jack, we don't have time for...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: We're taking a time out.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Please, just let me...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Look, you want to get to work -- you're going to tell me how you got here.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: It was 3 years ago. I was on a solo race around the world, and my boat crashed into the reef, and then Kelvin came.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Kelvin?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Kelvin -- he comes running out of the jungle -- hurry, hurry, come with me. He brings me down here. The first thing he does -- because there's beeping already -- he types in the code, he pushes the button, and it stops. What was all that about, I say. Just saving the world, he says.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Saving the world?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: His words, not mine. So I started pushing the button, too. And we saved the world together for awhile, and that was lovely. Then Kelvin died, and now here I am all alone. The end.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK:  Don't tell me you believe this. This is crazy. You think that makes sense -- pushing a button? You're going to take his word for it?!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: His word is all we have, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: You don't have to take my word for it. Watch the film.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: The bookcase -- top shelf, behind "Turn of the Screw" -- projector's in the pantry.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: Here! Dude, I've got to say, I didn't think we were going to get through the night. And I wasn't even here for that baby stealing part.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAYID: I can assure you it was very exciting.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: It's about time things are finally returning to normalness.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 KATE: Sayid!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: Uh, crap.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 KATE: Sayid, we need your help.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER:  What do you know? What did they do to you? Who the hell are they? Who the hell are they?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JIN: Others. 바닷가에서 붙잡혔어.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MICHAEL: Did you see Walt?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: The Others? How many? How many?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JIN:  놈들이 내 눈을 가렸어. 눈, 눈!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MICHAEL: He was blindfolded.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: There could be a hundred of them out there. Push me up.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: Push me up. I'm going to try and get us out of here. C'mon, help us out, Jin.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: They've got it weighted down with something. It's tied off somewhere. C'mon, lift me higher.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MICHAEL: It's a girl.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: You want to tell me what was going on down here before I showed up, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Kate was tied up, Desmond had a gun on me. I think you pretty much caught the gist of it.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK:  Desmond...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: He wanted to know a lot about us -- how we got here -- if we were sick.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: You didn't ask anything about him?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: He was the one with the gun.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: You sure seem calm for someone who believes the world's going to end in the next 45 minutes.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: He'll fix it.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: You understand that what he's saying. It's -- it's insane. It's impossible.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Why is it insane?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Because the last time I saw a computer that was going to save the world, it didn't look like that.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Is the reason you're so upset because he said he recognized you?  Because that would be impossible.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MARVIN CANDLE: Welcome, I'm Dr. Marvin Candle, and this is the orientation film for Station 3 of the DHARMA Initiative. In a moment you'll be given a simple set of instructions for how you and your partner will fulfill the responsibilities associated with the station. But first, a little history.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MARVIN CANDLE: The DHARMA Initiative was created in 1970, and it is the brainchild of Gerald and Karen DeGroot -- two doctoral candidates at the University of Michigan. Following in the footsteps of visionaries such as B.F. Skinner  imagined a large scale communal research compound where scientists and free thinkers from around the globe could pursue research in meteorology, psychology, parapsychology, zoology, electromagnetism, and Utopian social  Danish industrialist and munitions magnate Alvar Hanso whose financial backing made their dream of a multi-purpose social science research facility a reality.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MARVIN CANDLE: You and your partner are currently located in Station 3, or the Swan, and will be for the next 540 days. The Station 3 was originally constructed as a laboratory where scientists could work to understand the unique electromagnetic fluctuations emanating from this sector of the Island.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MARVIN CANDLE: Not long after the experiments began, however, there was an incident. And since that time the following protocol has been observed: every 108 minutes the button must be pushed. From the moment the alarm sounds you will have 4 minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor  induction into the program. When the alarm sounds, either you or your partner must input the code. It is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts. In this manner you will stay as fresh and alert  utmost importance that when the alarm sounds the code be entered correctly, and in a timely fashion. Do not attempt to use the computer  for anything . Congratulations, until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands. On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso and all of us at the DHARMA Initiative, thank you. Namaste. And good luck.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: We're going to need to watch that again.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: What's that?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: It's a present. It's been 6 months -- sort of an anniversary, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: I didn't get you anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: That's okay. It only cost me a buck.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: It's to my place -- thought you might be tired of knocking.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Oh, well, Helen. I don't know what to say.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: There's uh, just one condition, though, John. When you stay over, you stay over.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: What do you mean?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: I followed you last night -- to that house that you go to. Is it your father's house?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Why would you follow me, Helen? Why would you do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: Well, you sneak off in the middle of the night. I -- I just needed to know where you were going? I care about you, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Well, yeah, but what I do is my business. It's personal.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: I wasted 20 years of my life being angry. I told myself I would get over it, but I couldn't do it alone. I needed to find help. You help me John. And I can help you. You just have to promise me that you're not going to go to that place anymore.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Alright.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: Alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: You're going to watch that again?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Aren't you?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: No, John, I'm not.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MICHAEL: Okay, okay, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: You alright, sister?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: Who are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MICHAEL: We crashed here. We were on a plane, Sydney to Los Angeles.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: 40 of us made it.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: Flight 815?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: You were on it, too?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MICHAEL: What? You were in the back? It broke off mid-air. How did you...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: I don't know. I don't know. The plane came apart, and -- and somebody's fricking hardside came out of the overhead and knocked me out. I woke up under water and made my way to the top -- swam to shore.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: You've been out here by yourself all this time?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: Trying to find food -- making my way -- hoping to find somebody. And then, yesterday, they found me.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MICHAEL: Who are they?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: You tell me.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MICHAEL: Did you see a -- a boy? 10 years old? They took my son.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: No, I'm sorry. I'm Ana Lucia.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: Sawyer. This is Mike. The quiet Korean guy is Jin. We're about to be the best thing that ever happened to you.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: How's that?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: Because next time Shaft opens the cage  he's going to get a surprising little howdy-doody.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Are you in contact with the people that made it -- the film? Are you in contact with anyone?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Do you think I'd be here if I was?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: How is it that you didn't know about the crash? About us?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: I push this button every 108 minutes. I don't get out much.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: So, these replacements?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Kelvin died waiting for his replacements.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: So, you don't get out, you don't see anyone. Where does your food come from? You really think this is happening.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Why wouldn't it be?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: It says "quarantine" on the inside of the hatch to keep you down here. To keep you scared. But you know what? We've been up there for over 40 days and no one's gotten sick. You think that this is the only part of it that's true?! Do you ever think that maybe they put you down here to push a button every 100 minutes just to see if you would? That all of this -- the computer, the button -- it's just a mind game?! An experiment?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Every -- single -- day. And for all our sakes, I hope it's not real. But the film says this is an electromagnetic station. And I don't know about you, brother, but every time I walk past that concrete wall out there, my fillings hurt.  Right.  Oh no.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: It's over.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: What do you mean, it's over?!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: What are you doing? Are you leaving? Desmond? Wait. We can -- we can fix the computer. Sayid is coming. He knows...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Give him my best.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Wait, wait, wait -- where are you... You can't leave. Where are you going?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: As far as I can run, brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: What should we do?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Nothing. We do nothing. It's not real. None of it's real.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: This isn't -- this isn't what was supposed to happen!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: What was supposed to happen?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Please, don't leave me here.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Bye, John. You're on your own.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Why is this happening like this? What do you want? What do you... What am I supposed to do?!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Helen? Helen, what...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Helen, wait. Helen, don't. Helen.  Why are you doing this?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: He's not coming out of this house, John, because he doesn't care. I know why you're here -- why you keep coming here. You're scared. You're scared of moving forward -- with me, with us. You're going to have to choose. Him or me.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: No, no, no, it's not that simple.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: Yes it is.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: I, I, I can't. I can't.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: Yes, you can.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: No, I can't! -- I don't know how.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HELEN: Because you don't know what's going to happen. None of us do. That's why it's called a leap of faith, John. You don't have to be alone.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 KATE: Jack! Jack!  John?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: Dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAYID: What is this place?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 KATE: John, where's Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Jack's gone.  I need your help.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 KATE: What does it look like?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAYID: It's a breaker box. There has to be one. Follow the conduit lines.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: Cool, okay, great. What's a conduit line?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 KATE:  Those tubes -- follow those.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: Whoa!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 KATE: Did you find it?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: Uh, uh, depends on what you mean by it?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER:  Alright, here's what we're going to do -- Jin plays dead, you call for help.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: Sick prisoner -- are you serious?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: What? You got a better idea, sweetheart?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: Where'd you get that gun, anyway?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: The gun -- how'd you get it on the plane?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: There was a federal marshal on the plane.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: So, what? You just happen to have his gun?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: Yeah, I'm lucky. Mike, let's get this thing going...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: How come you didn't use it when they grabbed you?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: Gosh, I guess I was too busy getting hit in the face with a club. How come you're suddenly so interested, cupcake?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MICHAEL: Hey!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 MICHAEL: C'mon, let's just -- we gotta=
Lost.Season02.Episode03 ANA LUCIA: Back up! Back up. Pull me out. Pull me out!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LEADER: What happened? Who are they?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Stop.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Oh, right. The code, yeah?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Listen carefully. If by some miracle you manage to get the computer working again you've got to enter the code: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, hit execute. Again: 4, 8, 15-
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Shut up!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Sorry?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Nothing is going to happen. Some man takes you down there, shows you a movie, and you push a button on, on faith alone?  Nothing is going to happen!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: In about 15 minutes you're either going to be very right, or very wrong, brother. You want to shoot me?! Shoot me! But I'm not-
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Why are you running? You don't even know what you're running from?!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: I remember you -- running -- I know you -- I met you -- Los Angeles. I was training, yeah? You twisted your ankle...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Stop.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: You're a doctor, right? There was this girl -- you were worried -- you said, you said you failed her. That was you.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: It doesn't matter.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Was she okay, the girl?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: It doesn't matter.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: What happened to her?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: It doesn't matter.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: How can you say it doesn't matter?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: I married her! 
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: Right, and you're -- you're not married to her anymore, then?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 DESMOND: See you in another life, yeah?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE:  Can you fix it?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAYID: This man, whoever he was, replaced the motherboard. The power transformer is blown.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Don't you need to know why?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAYID: All I need to know is that the timer is counting down to something, and that this computer needs to be repaired. I'm sure you'll tell me why once I've done so.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 KATE: Found it!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: Oh, what's that?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Sayid!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAYID: Working on it.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: You have to...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAYID: I know what I have to do. Reconnected the processor, replaced the transformer.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: It's on.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 KATE: Okay, so what now?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: There was a code. He made me enter it.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: What code?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAYID: Do you remember what it is?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: 4, 8...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: Wait a minute...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: 15, 16...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: Dude, I'm serious, stop.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: Hugo, this is not the time or the place.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: Yeah, well, I think it is.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: 23...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: What is this thing? You don't even know what it does! I mean we need...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: 32...
Lost.Season02.Episode03 HURLEY: You know what? Forget it, go ahead, do your thing.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: It's not 32. It's 42. He just told me -- Desmond. The last number's 42.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: You're sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Yeah, I'm sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: You do it, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: You have to do it.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: You do it yourself, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: No, you saw the film, Jack. This is a two person job, at least.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAYID: This argument is irrelevant.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Sayid, don't.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 SAYID: Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Don't. It's not real. Look, you want to push the button, you do it yourself.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: If it's not real, then what are you doing here, Jack? Why did you come back? Why do you find it so hard to believe?!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: Why do you find it so easy?!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: It's never been easy!
Lost.Season02.Episode03 KATE: Maybe you should just do it.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 JACK: No. It's a button.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: I can't do this alone, Jack. I don't want to. It's a leap of faith, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode03 LOCKE: I'll take the first shift.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JIN: Hi there, Hurley.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Jin, you're here.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JIN: I sure am.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, you speak English.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JIN: No, you're speaking Korean.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: 나? 
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: 저 친구 여기서 뭐하는거야? 
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JIN: Everything's going to change.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: 뭐? 
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JIN: Everything's going to change. Have a cluckity-cluck-cluck day, Hugo.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 KATE: Hurley!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 KATE: You fell asleep?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: No, I was just -- resting my eyes.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 KATE:  The Numbers are written right there.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Yeah, I remember the Numbers. 
Lost.Season02.Episode04 KATE: Locke went back to the beach. So, I'll be taking the next shift.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Awesome.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 KATE: Jack told me about your job. At least we have jobs again, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Hurray for us. 
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Ain't life grand. What I wouldn't give for a cup of water right now.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JIN: 나를 올려 줘. 어서! 포기 하지 마! 
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: No way. No more human pyramids -- just forget it.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 MICHAEL:  Hey. Hey! Hey, let us out of here!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: No. Just -- chill!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 MICHAEL: Every minute I spend down here is another minute my boy is still out there.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Well, let me break it down for you, Mikey. Right now, Rambina and her buddies are trying to figure out what to do with us. Until they make up their damn mind there ain't nothing we can do.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JIN:  어깨에 상처가 아주 심해보여.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Ah, yeah. Why don't you pee on it?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LEADER:  Grab the rope. Please.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Don't do it.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA:  Climb the rope or I shoot your friend.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA:  You next.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Don't do it. She's bluffing. The gun's only got one bullet. She ain't going to waste it-
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Ow, son-of-a-bitch. Ow, God.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA:  Grab the rope.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: You want me, Hotlips, you're going to have to come down here and get me --  -- bitch.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 MARY JO: 4, 8, 15, 16, and 23, with the mega number 42. Whoever has those numbers has won, or will share in, a near record jackpot.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOTTO OFFICIAL: That's right, Mary Jo, because this is the 16th week without a winner.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CARMEN: Hugo? Hu.. Hugo! Hugo, wake up. Wake up! 
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Stop, ow, ow, mom, stop. I just slipped.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CARMEN: Slipped sitting down? Is it your heart?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Mom, I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CARMEN: You're lying. I always know because you don't look me in the eye.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: I'm not lying.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CARMEN: Then tell me what happened, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: It must be something I ate.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CARMEN: Yes, it must be something you ate because you eat basura, and you don't exercise.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: I do exercise.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CARMEN: Falling down is not exercise. The only time you move is to lift a drumstick from the bucket. Everyday it's the same thing, Hugo -- you work, TV, chicken. You have to change your life, Hugo. You think someone else will change it for you? Maybe if you pray everyday, Jesus Christ will come down from heaven, take 200 pounds and bring you a decent woman, and a new car. Yes, Jesus can bring you a new car.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Maybe I don't want to change. Maybe I like my life.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CARMEN: Oh, that must be Jesus.  Hola, momento.  Yes, it is Jesus! He wants to know what color car you want!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Hurley, we need to have a little chat. Don't worry, mommy's off for a walk, so it's just you, me and the baby. Spill it.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Spill what?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: What's in it?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Uh, nothing, really.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: You've been out there an entire day and night -- looking at nothing?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Well, I guess it's kind of like a bunker, you know, from WWII, only newer.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: What's in it?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: I don't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: But somehow you know it's a bunker?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Well, I guess someone told me.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: You're going to lie to me? You're going to lie to the baby?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, look, I'd never lie.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Oh, and the time you told you were worth 150 million dollars?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: It's 156 million.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: I'm sorry, I must have confused it with the 900 trillion I am worth myself. And this baby's made of chocolate lollipops. So, if you'll excuse us, I'm going to flap my wings and fly off this Island!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Hey, Rose.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Hey yourself.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: So, doing laundry, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Indeed I am. You want to hand me those dirty clothes over there?  Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Don't you want to know what happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: You know, out there. Everyone's asking me what's in the Hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: That's your business, honey.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Don't you want to know?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Well, whatever it is, it's not going to help get this laundry done, now is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Well, actually, it sort of is.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: It's around here somewhere.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Someone actually lived down here?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Uh-huh.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Oh. What -- what is it for?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: It's kind of a long story.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK:  Hurley? Who else did you tell?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: No one. I swear. Dude, it's a big job. I needed -- help.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Hello, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: Hey, Rose.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: She's cool. She won't tell anyone.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Honey, I don't even know what I would say.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: All this is food?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: It's only a matter of time before we have to tell everyone what we found down here.  So, do you know what to do?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Inventory of all of it, and figure out how we make it last.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: And in the meantime, nobody gets anything -- no exceptions. That's your responsibility, Hurley. Okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: What's that?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: You don't want to know.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: DHARMA Initiative Salad Dressing - Ranch composite. Sounds tasty.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Apollo bars? Ever hear of these?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Huh-uh, but candy is candy. That's what Bernard always says. Talk about a sweet-tooth. That man has a mouth full of sweet-teeth.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Bernard, that was your husband?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Is my husband.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Oh, but, I thought he was in the back of the plane.  I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Oh, no, no -- that's okay. Don't feel bad. Bernard is fine. I know it. You want to get the canned tuna?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Everyone's going to hate me, Rose.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Now that's just plain silly. You're about the only one on this Island that everybody loves.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Well, that'll change.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 KATE: Hey, you guys happen to find any shampoo in here?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Yeah, there's some right over here.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Uh, Kate, you can't take...
Lost.Season02.Episode04 KATE:  Thanks, Hurley. 
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: It's just one bottle.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: That's where it starts.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Hey, Hugo. You okay, man?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY:  Yeah, I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 RANDY:  Reyes, my office, now!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 RANDY: You want to tell me something, Reyes?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Uh, no.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 RANDY: You sure about that?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Uh, yeah?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 RANDY: This is last night's surveillance tape.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 RANDY: You owe the company for an 8 piece dark meat combo.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: I didn't eat 8 pieces!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 RANDY: You want to watch the whole tape? Oh, and while you're here, how many times do I get to tell you those napkins cost money, alright? It's two per customer -- two. We are not made of money here at Mr. Clucks, Reyes. I'm not made of money. Are you made of money? Because if you're made of money -- maybe you don't want to work here. So get it together. What -- is that a problem, Reyes?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, I quit.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Dude, are you okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: I'm, I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Randy's losing his brain in there.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: You should get back in there or he'll have you scrubbing johns for the rest of the week.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Doubt it. I quit, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Looks like we've got ourselves a day off. Who needs money when you've got good looks?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: You can come out now. I saw you back at the rock, and then at the mangrove tree. In fact, I walked in a big circle. I'm not sure how you didn't realize it.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Alright, you don't have to insult me.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE:  You want to tell me why you've been following me, Charlie?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Yeah. Quite simply, John, there are a lot of secrets around here, and I'm tired of being at the bloody kid's table. I got Claire's baby back. I didn't go swanning off to the Black Rock on the bloody A-Team mission, but I would have if someone had asked me. I think I'm entitled to some sodding answers around here.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: What do you want to know?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: How's it going?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAYID: It's not. On the other side of this door there's more concrete. I'd say it's at least 8 to 10 feet thick.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: You see this? 
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAYID: Interesting. Good thing this  is titanium. Almost no magnetic attraction. But we're not going to get in up here.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: Up here?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAYID: Perhaps we can go under it.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LEADER: Grab the rope.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: I ain't doing nothing 'til I know if my friends are okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 MICHAEL:  So, we're friends now, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA:  Do it now, or the rope comes up.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Howdy boys. Thanks for the rescue.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 MICHAEL: Everything's cool. We had a talk and they believe we were on the plane, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Swell, I guess we can all sue Oceanic together.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA:  What you got there?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA: You got a rock? You looking for some revenge? You've got 3 seconds to drop it.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LEADER: Ana...
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA: 1, 2...
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Now, hold on...
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Ow, you didn't say 3.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA: Shut up. When I tell you to do something, you do it -- I say move, you move -- I say stop, you stop. I say jump, what do you say?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: You first.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA:  You don't like the rules, I toss your ass back in the pit right now, you understand?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: I understand.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA: It's getting dark, we're moving out.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Moving out where?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA: What did I just tell you?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Sorry, forgot. Just one thing, though -- you hit me again, I'll kill you.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA: Let's go.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: He pushed that button every 108 minutes?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: He did indeed.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: But how is that possible? I mean, didn't he sleep?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: Don't know -- didn't get a chance to ask him.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: And after all that time, he just up and left? I mean, why? Where'd he go?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: Don't know. I tried to track him, but he didn't leave much of a trail. I guess he figured he found his replacements.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Meaning us?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: Meaning us.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: It -- sounds a bit nutty, doesn't it?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: It is what it is, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: And what happens if we don't push it?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: We're not going to find out. I'm setting up a system. I'm still working on it, but it looks like it's going to be two person shifts every 6 hours or so.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Shifts? Pushing a button?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: Oh, and there's a record player.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: What's Hurley been doing there?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: He's in charge of the food.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Food?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Hey mate? Where you been?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Hey, I've been -- around.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: I know, Hurley.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: You know what?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: I know about the food. Locke told me everything.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Yeah, well, Locke's lying.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Oh yeah, is he lying about the button we have to push every 108 minutes or the Island will explode?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: It's not going to explode!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Ah , come on.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Look, Jack put me in charge. Look, I don't even want...
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Is there peanut butter?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Peanut butter -- nutty, creamy, staple of children everywhere.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Uh, yeah. A couple jars.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Brilliant. How about you give us one? -- It's for Claire.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: No can do, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: You're saying no to a nursing mother?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: It's not like that.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Oh, it's exactly like that. You know, I never thought this would happen but it did. You've become one of them.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: One of them?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CHARLIE: Them - the man... management! I thought we were friends. You've changed, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Drive Shaft - more like Suck Shaft.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: I'm going to go check out the headphones.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Sure, headphones.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 STARLA: Hu-go.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Star-la.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 STARLA: Why aren't you chuckleheads at work?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: We're currently exploring other opportunities.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 STARLA: You quit?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: I did.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: He's mixing it up today. He's off the rail. Somebody get a straitjacket.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY:  Hey, can I try those on?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 STARLA: You're messing with my worldview here, Hugo. You're my rock. I mean if you quit your job the next thing you know bees will stop making honey, and flowers will die, and, hell, the whole damn thing will fall apart.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY:  So, Starla!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Sorry. Uh, well, The Hold Steady is playing the Troubadour this weekend, and I was wondering -- maybe Friday...
Lost.Season02.Episode04 STARLA: Um, I have to work.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Oh, no, I didn't mean...
Lost.Season02.Episode04 STARLA: I could probably go Saturday. Is that cool?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Yeah, that's totally cool.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY:  Dude, you've been crushing on this girl for months and doing nothing. Today you're fricking Fabio. Seriously, man, what has gotten into you?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Nothing, I just wanted to ask her out before...
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Before what?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAYID: This is the last duct. I believe we're under the area where we began. They poured concrete all the way down here, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAYID: Just as thick.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: Maybe there's a way around it.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: What is all this stuff?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAYID: My best guess? There's a geothermal generator behind this wall. That's the power source. Careful with these pipes, they're very hot.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: That's it -- nothing -- it's blocked. So what do you think, Sayid?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAYID: What do I think about what, Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: This place -- the computer? What do you think is going on?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAYID: The last time I heard of concrete being poured over everything in this way was Chernobyl.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: Did you hit something?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAYID: I don't think so. It's coming from over there.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: I'm going to check it out.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: You, um, you took a shower.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 KATE: I had to see if it worked.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: How was it?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 KATE:  Uh, pressure sucked, it kind of went cold at one point, and it smelled a little bit like sulfur but -- it was a shower.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: Yeah, I know what you mean.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 KATE: You could use one.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: Maybe a little later.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 KATE:  I'll leave the shampoo for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LIBBY: I'm Libby.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 MICHAEL: Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LIBBY: How many of you -- you know, on the other side of the Island?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 MICHAEL: When we left, around 40. How many of you survived?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LIBBY: 23 of us.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LEADER:  Are you alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Now you give a damn.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LEADER: I said I'm sorry. It was a misunderstanding.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: A misunderstanding is when you bring me lemonade instead of iced-tea.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA: I said: no talking.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: He was talking to me.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ANA LUCIA:  We're here.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: What are you going to do -- beam us up?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 MICHAEL:  I thought you said there were 23 of you.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LIBBY: There were.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CLAIRE: Hi, Sun.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SUN: What's wrong?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 CLAIRE: I -- I found something out in the water, and I told Shannon about it, and we thought you should know about it.  It's the messages from the raft. We thought you should decide what to do.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Why'd you tell Charlie, man?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: Because he asked, Hugo.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Yeah, well you shouldn't have. You should have listened to me about coming down here, period. Now it's all going to change, everything.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: Change is good, Hugo.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: You know, people say that, but it's not true, man. Trust me, I know. And guess who gets to be the bad guy who has to say: no you can't have peanut butter for the cute blonde and her poor Island baby. You know who? It's me. -- You know what? I'm not going to do it. Find someone else to deal with the chow, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: No, we all have our jobs, Hugo. My job is to convince people to push a button every 108 minutes without them knowing why -- or for what. Wanna trade?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: I don't want to do this, man!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 LOCKE: Yeah, I've had a lot of jobs I didn't want to do. I still did them. I'm sorry, Hugo, you don't get to quit.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Okay, then.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Be careful.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, I am!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: You got it?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Yeah, I got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Alright, let's go.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Do you think we got enough gnomes?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Okay, we're good.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: This is genius.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: A little to the left, dude, and more of an angle.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 RANDY: Hey!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Run!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Cluck you, Randy!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY:  Freedom!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY:  Dude, what are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Freedom! So, anything else you want to do tonight -- you better let me know now -- because our day off is just about over, Huggy Bear. In about 10 hours we going to have to find ourselves some new employment. I hear Pizza Bin is hiring, or we could try our luck at, ah, Gyro-Rama. But I do kind of dig the chick who works at the Bin.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, promise me something.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Okay, what?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Promise me that no matter what happens, we'll never change -- this will never change.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Okay. Oh, I know what this is about. I know why you've been acting so weird lately. You're getting that, uh, that, uh, stomach stapling surgery thing, aren't you?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: I'm not getting surgery.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Awe, c'mon man, it's cool. I mean, I could still be all surprised and be like, ooh, my, Hurley, wow, is that you?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Listen, Johnny, I'm serious. Promise me that you and I will always stay the same.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: I'll do you one better. Not only will I stay gold, Ponyboy, I will drink to it.  Can I borrow 2 bucks?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: What have you got there, Hurley?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Uh, it's dynamite.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Dynamite? Well, what are you doing with it?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: I'm sorry, but I can't let it happen again.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Why is there a news crew here?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, we shouldn't go here. Dude, let's go, they jack the prices here.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY:  Maybe somebody got shot.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Why are you doing this, honey?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Look, just get out of here, Rose.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: But you're going to hurt somebody.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Not if I do it from outside the door. It's thick, and I'll make sure there's nobody around first. So, please, will you just go?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 ROSE: Uh-uh, you hauled me off of the beach and you dragged me into this place -- the least I can get is an explanation before you blow it up!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: You don't get it! This is going to mess it all up!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JOHNNY: Dude, somebody won the lottery!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Let me tell you something, Rose! We were all fine before we had any  potato chips! But now we've got these potato chips and everybody's going to want them! So Steve gets them, and Charlie's pissed -- but he's not pissed at Steve, he's pissed at me!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 GAS STATION CLERK: That's the guy! That's the guy!
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: And I'm going to be in the middle of it! And then it's going to be: well, what about us -- why didn't I get any potato chips? C'mon, help us out, Hurley. Why did you give Kate the shampoo? And why didn't I get the peanut butter? Then, they'll get really mad and start asking: why does Hugo have everything -- why should he get to decide?  Then they'll all hate me. I don't know what to do.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Come on, Jack. The inventory's done, this is the only way.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: Are you serious?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, there's enough food in there to feed one guy, 3 meals a day for another 3 months. We have 40 people, it's just not going to work. You put me in charge, this is what we're doing.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK:  Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY: Okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 JACK: Yeah, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 HURLEY:  Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 BERNARD: Um, excuse me. Hi. Back where you guys, uh, where you came from -- is there a woman named Rose there?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 SAWYER: Black chick in her 50's?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 BERNARD:  Is she, is she okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode04 MICHAEL: Yeah, man, she's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 BERNARD: Oh, oh.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 MICHAEL: Michael, I'm Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 BERNARD: Thank you, Michael. I'm, I'm Bernard.
Lost.Season02.Episode04 MICHAEL: Okay, it's okay. She's good.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: It's been 4 days.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 CLAIRE: You know, that's not that long. They said it could take up to 2 weeks to find a current. I mean, Michael knew what he was doing. I doubt anything would have...
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 어머 어떡해. 어떡해... 어디갔지? 어디갔지? 어딨어?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 CLAIRE: What? What?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 제발...
Lost.Season02.Episode05 CLAIRE: Sun, what's wrong?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: My wedding ring, it's gone.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MRS. PAIK: 얘야. 너 그 옷 입고 나갈거야? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 이 옷이 어때서? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 왜? 나 그 신발 마음에 드는데! 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MRS. PAIK: 괜찮지만, 넌 오늘 이것을 신어라. 남자 키가 너보다 작을 수가 있잖아. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 말도 안돼 정말... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MRS. PAIK: 대학 때 남자를 만났으면 지금 중매쟁이도 필요 없잖아! 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 대학을 연애하러 다니나? 공부하러 다니지. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MRS. PAIK: 4년 대학 졸업하고, 넌 지금 은메달이야! 그러니까 동메달이 되기 전에 남자를 찾아야지. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 때가 되면, 내 남편감은 내가 찾을게요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MRS. PAIK: 니 아빠가 그 때가 지금이라고 말하셨어. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 TAI: 정말이야, 임마! 너 올해가 애정의 운세네. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 그래? 그렇게 나왔다면 믿어 봐야지. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 TAI: 야 우리 할머니도 할아버지를 그렇게 만났어. 그리고 말이야 이 책은 한번도 틀린 적이 없거든. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 어떤 여잔데? 아니, 어떻게 생겼는지 알아야 만나면 알아보지. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 TAI: 오렌지. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 오렌지. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 TAI: 너의 사랑은 오렌지야! 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 야, 내 주제에 결혼은 무슨! 내 입에 풀칠하기도 바쁜데. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 TAI: 야, 요즘 능력있는 여자가 얼마나 많은데 그러냐? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 남자가 자존심이 있지... 임마, 인생의 목표가 있어야지! 남보다 열심히 일해서 승진도 빨리 하고 성공해야지. 남들이 어부의 자식놈이라고 업신여기지 못하게... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 TAI: 자식, 1차 면접보고 되게 그러네. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 나에겐 인생의 중대사야 임마.   자, 어때? 멋있지? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 TAI: 멋있다.   야야야, 그 가격표는 떼어야지! 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 무슨 소리야? 내일 백화점에 어떻게 반환하라고? 이 넥타이 얼마나 비싼건데! 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 TAI: 진수야. 운명의 여자가 나타나면 뭐라고 전해줄까? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 기다리라고 해. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Hey man, it's okay. Sun -- you'll be with her again. Soon, okay. Hey, I think they're trying to figure out what to do with us.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: I think they're going to eat us.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: All right, all of you -- get up. We're moving out.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Moving out where?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: You're going to help us get food and water.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: What -- we work for you now?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: You're going to do it because we have a long walk ahead of us.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: A long walk where?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Back to where you came from.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: All clear.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER:  Hey Mike, I think we ought to stage a prison break here.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Yeah, well I want to figure out what the hell's going on over here before I make any decisions about anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Okay people, listen up. We need to gather as much food and water as we can. You travel in pairs. You move as fast as you can. Don't make any noise.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Maybe you could just take a minute to explain us what the hell is going on over here that's got you all so on edge.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: You know what? That's a great idea, maybe we can swap stories on the road.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LEADER: I'm going to go scout before we move.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER:  I think she needs to be slapped.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Cindy, go with him. Libby, see what fruit you can gather. Take him with you.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY: His name is Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Yeah, right, Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER:  Wait.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: I'll be okay, man. Don't worry.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Bernard and I will gather the fish.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: Fish. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: The man knows how to fish. I'd take him with you if I were you.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Fine, he comes with us, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JACK: Sun, you okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: I lost my wedding ring.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JACK: When was the last time you saw it?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: I'm so used to it. I don't, I don't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JACK: I lost my wedding ring once. It's crazy where you look when you want to find something bad enough. I went through the garbage outside the house -- emptied the bags and everything. I even took apart the pipes in my bathroom because I was convinced that it had gone down the drain in the sink.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: What did your wife say?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JACK: She never knew.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: How is that?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JACK: I went to a jeweler and I had a replica made, that's how. Yeah, now it's just rattling around in my sock drawer back home. Um, I can help you look.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: No, thanks. I'm sure it will turn up.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Hey, hey, you want to help us out over here?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: You want to eat? Help us.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 고기 잡는 꼴 하고는... 저러다가 굶어 죽지!
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Does it look like I speak Korean?!
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: Fish.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: 아시아나 호텔에서도 근무했다고? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 네. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: 보조 웨이터로? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 네. 웨이터로 승진했습니다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: 거기서는 승진하기가 힘들었을텐데... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 네 맞습니다. 제가 운이 좋았던 것 같습니다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: 자네 시골 출신이지? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 네? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: 생김새로나 말투로 봐서 도시 태생은 아닌 것 같고... 자네 고향이 어디야? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 아, 예... 남해입니다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: 어쩐지. 생선 냄새가 나더라니. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: 가격표는 떼고 다니시지? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 감사합니다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: (Picking up the phone) 오늘부터 권진수 씨 직원으로 발령하세요.   지금부터 바로 일 시작하고, 비가 오나 눈이 오나 열심히 일하되 봉급 인상이나 휴가는 없어. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: 미스터 권! 서울 게이트웨이 호텔은 최상의 서비스를 자랑하는 한국 최고의 호텔이야. 자네 같은 사람들은 절대로 드나들 수 없는 곳이야. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 네. 알겠습니다. 열심히 하겠습니다. 감사합니다! 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY: Sorry, Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Sorry about what?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY: You know, about throwing you and your friends into the pit.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Friends.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: I guess I just never thought about it like that. I mean, I guess one of them is my friend.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY: I'm guessing not the redneck.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Yeah, not the redneck.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY: I don't think I've ever seen someone so scared in my life. And I know about scared.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: That why you threw us in the pit -- because you're scared?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY: And we've got trust issues.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Huh, how about that? Where the hell are all the fruit?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY: We picked these trees pretty clean. Sometimes you can find them on the ground.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Why don't you head inland? That's where all the fruit is on our side.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY: We don't go that way.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Why?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY: Because that's where They come from.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LEADER: For your protection when we travel.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: Did you make this? So what's your name, anyway?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LEADER: Mister Eko.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: Mr. Echo?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: So what's that, like Mr. Ed?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY:  It's Michael, he just left.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY: He just said something and he went into the jungle. He's gone.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Let's go. We're leaving now.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: What do you mean, we're leaving?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Your buddy ran off into the jungle.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LIBBY: Michael, he just left.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 마이클이 아들을 잃어버려서 찾으러 가는거야. 그래서 저래.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 BERNARD: What's he trying to say? What's he saying?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 어딘가에 살아있다고 생각하나봐. Walt! Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Let's go. We're moving out now. Cindy, water. Libby, can you carry the radio?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: Wait, you have a radio? Does it work? Can you use it?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Wow, what a great idea! You going to slow us down?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: No! Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: We're leaving before he can tell Them where we are.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN:  Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: What are we supposed to do, wait for him? He ain't coming back without his kid. Walt - he ain't coming back without Walt. You really think he's going to find him? In case you haven't noticed it's every man for himself, Chewie. Mike's got to worry about Mike. And I've got to worry about me.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: Wait, please.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: You're going the wrong way.  That's where he's going. Toward Them.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA:  What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: I'm going to help him find his friend.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: We can't wait for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: I don't expect you to.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 HURLEY: All you've got to do is retrace your steps. Like, what'd you do yesterday?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: I woke up, washed up, walked with Shannon, picked some fruit, cut it up to feed Vincent. And then I was...
Lost.Season02.Episode05 HURLEY: Whoa, you fed the dog?  Bingo!
Lost.Season02.Episode05 HURLEY: So, Seoul. Is that in the good Korea or the bad Korea?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: The good one.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 HURLEY: Did you go to the Olympics?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: Hurley, this is ridiculous. Waiting here for... the dog did not eat my ring.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 HURLEY: Dude, dogs will eat anything. When I was a kid, my dog, Buster -- I had this drawer where I'd throw in all my change, right -- and I guess there were some Smarties in there -- so, like, the next day, Buster craps out a buck thirty-five in nickels.  Did you ever own a dog?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: Yes. Jin gave me one, a puppy.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 HURLEY: What was his name?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: Bpo Bpo.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 HURLEY: Bpo Bpo -- that mean something?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: Yes, it means a kiss.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 HURLEY: A kiss.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MRS. PAIK: 얘야, 선아, 말할 때 손짓하지 말아. 알았어? 그리고, 질문 받기 전에는 절대로 말하면 안된다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MRS. SHIN: 안녕하세요? 예쁘게 생겼네. 마음에 쏙 들거야. 잘 생겼지, 학벌 좋지, 아버님이 이 호텔 회장님이셔. 거기다가 호텔을 열두개나 가지고 있대. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN:  어서오십시오, 서울 게이트웨이 호텔을 찾아주셔서 감사합니다! 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MRS. PAIK: 호텔이 너무 멋있어요! 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MRS. LEE: 무슨 과찬의 말씀을... 제가 알기로는 댁의 따님이 서울대학 다녔다면서요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MRS. PAIK: 네... 아무렴 하버드만 하겠어요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MRS. SHIN: 자, 이제 그만 둘이서 얘기할 수 있도록 시간을 좀 내줍시다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 어느 분이 더 걱정하세요? 어머님, 아니면 아버님? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 저희 아버님이요. 물론 어머님을 통해서. 그 쪽은요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 저도 저희 아버님이죠. 물론 어머님을 통해서... 이모하고 할머니까지 동원하셨어요. 무슨 전공 하셨어요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 미술 역사학이요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 오... 그래요? 솔직히 말씀드리면 전 미술은 잘 몰라요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 뭘 전공하셨는데요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 중세 러시아 문학이요. 어쩌다보니 지금은 호텔 일을 하고 있네요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 예... 어쩌다 보니까? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 실은 항상 맞선 별로였거든요. 근데 오늘은 좀 다른데요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 네, 저도요... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: Wait, no.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO:  His name was Goodwin.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: Others?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: Michael?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: No, for your cut.  So, you're married? Your ring. You have a wife?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: Yes. You?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: Worse. Your wife, what is her name? Her name?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: Sun.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: She was with you? On the plane? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LOCKE: Bad day?  It's clean.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LOCKE: You mind if I sit? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: Did you see me?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LOCKE: Rip apart your garden? No.  Sometimes I wish I had a garden to tear apart.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: I don't think I have ever seen you angry.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LOCKE: Oh, I used to get angry all the time. Frustrated too.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: You are not frustrated anymore?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LOCKE: I'm not lost anymore.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: How did you do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 LOCKE: Same way anything lost gets found -- I stopped looking.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 안녕하세요, 사장님. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE:  그 꽃 좀 빌려주시겠어요? 데이트가 있어서... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 아, 예... 물론이죠. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 고마워요. 성함이? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 권진수라고 합니다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 고맙습니다, 권진수 씨. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 갑자기 카드가 안 되는 거에요, 그러니까 제가 타월만 걸치고 변태처럼 복도에 서있게 됐었죠... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 영화에서만 나오는 장면 같아요! 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 그리고 호텔 메이드에게 상황을 설명하는데, 글쎄 제가 사장이라니까 절대로 안 믿는 거에요! 얼마나 황당하던지... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 생각보다 참... 평범하신 것 같아요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 선 씨도 참 좋은 분이신 것 같아요. 그래서 말인데, 앞으로 우리 계속 만나는 걸로 하면 어떨까요? 그러면 부모님들도 안심하시고 우릴 놔두시지 않겠어요? 맞선 볼 걱정도 없고, 부모님 눈치 볼 일도 없고... 한마디로 자유로워지는거죠. 그리고 한마디 더 말씀드려도 될까요? 비밀인데... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 네, 말씀하세요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 하버드에서 백인 여자친구를 만났어요. 아직 아버지한테 말씀 못 드렸지만, 6개월 후에 미국에 돌아가서 그녀와 결혼할 겁니다.  잠깐, 제가 -  
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 아니오, 걱정 마세요. 미국이요... 멋지시네요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 제가 잘못... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 꼭 행복하세요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MANAGER: 안녕하십니까 사장님. 뭐 더 좀 필요하신 거 없으십니까? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 아니오, 괜찮습니다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MANAGER: 커피나 디저트 갖다 드릴까요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 아니에요. 제가 중요한 약속이 있어서요, 그만... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JAE: 아니, 선 씨! 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 오늘 점심 고마웠어요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: No, not that way. Over here.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: A round heel. This is fresh. These tracks...
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: Yes, Michael. They don't leave tracks.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: No, they don't have him. They came from that way  Your friend went that way , crossed ahead of them... very lucky.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: You, go back. I go.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: No, we go together.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 POOR MAN: 잠시만요 잠시만, 저 실례지만 제 아들놈이 급해서 그러는데... 화장실 좀 써도 될까요? 부탁합니다, 급해서 그러는데... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 죄송하지만 호텔 손님만 사용할 수 있습니다. 저 아래로 가시면 화장실이 있습니다.   참을 수 있겠지?  
Lost.Season02.Episode05 POOR MAN: 부탁합니다. 급해서 그러는데... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 알았어요. 들어가서 왼쪽에 있으니까 빨리 쓰고 나오세요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 POOR MAN: 예예예, 대단히 감사합니다. 대단히 감사합니다. 감사합니다, 감사합니다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 들어가세요... 들어가세요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 POOR MAN: 들어가 빨리, 빨리 들어가.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: 미스터 권, 누가 들여보내래? 내가 자네에게 그렇게 시켰나? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 잘못했습니다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: 이거, 첫 번째 경고야. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 꼬마가 너무 급해 해서... 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: 길에서 싸든 무슨 상관이야! 너 같은 놈들 다 그런 거 아냐? 여기서 계속 일하고 싶으면 지금 당장 들어가서 그 놈들을 쫓아 보내! 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MR. KIM: 아니... 뭐 하는 거야 이거! 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN:  그 동안 고마웠습니다.  
Lost.Season02.Episode05 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: Hello.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 KATE:  It's pretty. Hurley told me that you lost your wedding ring.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: I was just sitting here telling myself it's silly to be so upset about it -- it is just a thing.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 KATE: Well, they've only been gone a few days, and...
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: Don't. I'm sick of everyone saying he's alright. He's not alright. Claire found the bottle -- the one with the messages inside -- the one from the raft.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 KATE: Where is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: I buried it.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Stop.  Let me see your water.  You keep slowing us down, we're going to leave you behind.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: Go ahead, leave me behind.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Alright. See ya.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: Got a question for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Yeah?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: Now that your tracker's gone how are you going to find our camp without me?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Walk across the Island, follow the beaches. And Eko's coming back.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: You married?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: You married?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: Too bad, you seem suited for it.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: Funny. What about you?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER: No ma'am.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 ANA LUCIA: You gay?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SAWYER:  Funny. Let's go. What are we waiting for?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: Wait here, we lost his trail. I'll go back and find it.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: What are you doing? Go back.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: Michael!
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Go back, man!
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Walt! Walt! Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: Michael!
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: Go away! I'm not going back without him. Walt! I'm here! Where are you, man?!  Walt!!  What, you worried they're going to hear me? Let them take me! Come! Come take me!
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO:  Shouting is not a good idea. You need to come back with us now.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: I'm not leaving him out here!  Stay away from me.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 EKO: I know they took your son. But you have no idea what these people are capable of -- and they will not be found if they don't want to be.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 MICHAEL: They took him right out of my hands -- right out of my hands! I'm not going back without him.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: You find Walt, Michael. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 KATE: Can I see it?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: Kate! Those are private. Kate, stop. What are you doing?!
Lost.Season02.Episode05 KATE: We didn't, uh... I didn't say goodbye.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: Sawyer?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 KATE: Sun?
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 어머, 죄송해요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN: 죄송합니다.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN: 제가 죄송해요.
Lost.Season02.Episode05 SUN, JIN: 괜찮으세요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode05 JIN:   여기 있습니다.  제가...
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: You thirsty, dog? Yeah, you're always thirsty, aren't ya? So drink.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID:  Come on, gather your things.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Where are we going? Sayid?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Right over here.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON:  Where are we going?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: What do you think?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Does it have an inside?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: When did you do this?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: It's all yours.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: You're quite welcome.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID:  I'm sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: You need to carry that all the time?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: I only carry it because I have someone to protect.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CINDY: Ana, it's got to be over an hour. Shouldn't we start moving again?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: Let them rest a little while longer.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CINDY: Yeah, but what if they come?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: She's lost.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: I'm not lost.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: Then tell me, Ponce de Leon, which way are we supposed to go?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: Alright then, genius, where would you go?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: Hey, I'm with you -- sit tight and wait for Mr. Eko to show up and guide us.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: If your friend didn't run off, Eko would still be here now, wouldn't he? You sure didn't have any problem leaving him behind, though, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: Mike only cares about himself and his kid, and neither's got squat to do with me.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL:  Glad you feel that way.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: Didn't expect to see you again.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 JIN:   걸을 수 있겠어?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: Yeah, yeah, Chewie, I know. My arm's about to fall off.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA:  You okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 EKO: Yes, but we have to go. I saw them.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CINDY: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BERNARD: What do you mean, you saw them?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CINDY: How many were there?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LIBBY: Did you see the kids?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: Libby.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 EKO: We need to go. Now.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: Alright. We're moving out. Now.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: So, does all this -- the tent, flowers -- mean that we're serious now?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Quite definitely not. I do this for all the girls I meet on deserted Islands.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON:  Don't go anywhere.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Where are you going?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: To get some water.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID:  Let me. I'll be right back.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: That was quick.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: There's nothing -- no one there.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I am telling you I saw Walt.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: It was a dream, Shannon.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: He was here. I saw him. He went into the tent.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: I was only gone a few moments. You must have fallen asleep.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: This was not a dream! I saw Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Then where is he?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE:  Hey, what's going on?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Nothing. It's just a dream; everything's fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Shannon...
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: What's wrong?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: Shannon had a nightmare.  Why's he up?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: I woke him.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: Woke him?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: I heard screams -- I got worried. Why, would you rather I had left him over there alone?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: You heard screams so woke up the baby and ran toward them?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: Okay, it sounded like she needed help.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: Well, he's going to need feeding now. He's going to be up all night and fussy all day.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: Sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: Alright, well, no harm done -- give him here then. I got him.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Wait. Wait! Come back with me; let's talk about this.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Do you believe me?  No. I know what I saw.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Beautiful, Sophie. Okay, can you bring your shoulders down for me a little -- extend up, good -- and finish. Very nice, ladies.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SOPHIE: Did my papa see me?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I think so.  Wonderful, alright, thank you for a great class today, ladies.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 NORA: He wants me to be his au pair, can you believe that?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Au pair, my ass.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 NORA:  Live in my big house, take care of my kids -- next thing you know it's: Oh, I'm so sorry; I did not know you were in the shower. What a perve!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Hello.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: Shannon, your father's been in an accident. I'm on my way to St. Sebastian's, I'll meet you there.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 DOCTOR: Mrs. Rutherford?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 DOCTOR: Why don't we talk down here?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: Doctor, my husband, Adam, how is he?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 DOCTOR: Your husband was in a head-on collision with an SUV. He suffered massive internal injuries. He stopped breathing at the site of the accident. I'm afraid we were unable to resuscitate him. I'm so sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: May I see him?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 DOCTOR: Of course. Would your daughter like to come?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: Step-daughter. Come on, Shannon.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: How much further to their camp?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 EKO: A day -- maybe more, maybe less.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: Thanks for being so specific.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: Damn it!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: Okay, okay. I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LIBBY: You want to let me just take a look at your shoulder?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: What, are you a doctor?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LIBBY: A clinical psychologist.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: You're a shrink? Well, maybe you ought to talk to my shoulder.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LIBBY: How'd you get shot, anyway?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: With a gun.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: He got shot when they took my kid.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: It's bad, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LIBBY: Yeah, it's bad. But it's not real bad. C'mon, you're going to be okay. Let's go.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: I got it. I'm alright. I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BERNARD: Let me give you a hand, okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 HURLEY: Um, tell me again why we're doing this here when there's a dryer in the hatch?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ROSE: I don't like the hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 HURLEY: Oh, it's because of the doomsday button, isn't it?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ROSE: Well, who needs a dryer when we've got sun and fresh air? We wouldn't want to spoil ourselves, now would we?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 HURLEY:  Yeah, spoiled.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON:  Hey, do you guys know where Michael and Walt left the stuff they didn't take with them on the raft?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 HURLEY: What kind of stuff?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Their clothes.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 HURLEY: I think their stuff's still on the beach back where their tent is.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ROSE: Poor thing, it can't be easy losing the one person you love on the Island.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Here, smell this, that's his, right? Come on, get a good whiff of it. You're always trying to run off and find him? Then find him. Find Walt.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Good dog. Find Walt.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE:  I know I woke you and I'm very, very sorry; but please, staying awake for 8 hours straight -- isn't that just cruel and unusual punishment?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: How's that cradle treating you?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: The cradles great. It's the baby that's the problem.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: What's wrong?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: He just won't sleep.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE:  May I?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: Sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Babies like the feeling of being constricted. It's not until we're older that we develop a desire to be free.  There.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: You know, I think everybody knows more about my baby than me.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Everybody?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: Charlie read me the riot act last night for waking him. And as mad as it made me -- turns out he was right. You know, it's like we're playing mum and dad to this baby. Yet, I don't remember marrying him.  No, seriously. I mean, we're practically strangers, him and me. For all I know, Charlie could be some religious freak.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Yeah, I seriously doubt that.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: Then why is he carrying around a Virgin Mary statue?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: You know, one of the little statues? He says he found it in the jungle.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Hmm, how about that?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE:  Death sucks, doesn't it?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Boone!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: Hey.  I'm so sorry, Shannon.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: You came back.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: Where'd the poster of Marky Mark go?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I'm 18, Boone. Your mom's going to freak.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: It's a wake. I mean, seriously, who doesn't serve booze at a wake? Scotch?  To your dad.  Maybe after all this you'll come visit me in New York.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I won't have to visit if I get that job at the Martha Graham dance company. I'll be living there.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: Right. Internship. 
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I know it's like a 1 in 3000 chance, but I may get it.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: Absolutely. Have you spoken to my mother?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: She's going through her thing and I'm going through mine.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: Have you two been getting along?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: She hates me.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: Just try to talk to her.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: From day one she resented my relationship with him, my dad.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 EKO: We need a break.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: 5 minutes!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 EKO:  Here.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: What are you looking at?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 EKO: We have to cut inland.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: What? Into the jungle? They said their people were on the beach. If we keep walking...
Lost.Season02.Episode06 EKO: The beach goes into a peninsula ahead. It may not be passable.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: May not?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 EKO: May not.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: You're doing this to get the cowboy back faster, aren't you? You would risk our lives to help him?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 EKO: It's the only way I know.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: I liked you better when you weren't talking.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: I can't believe he's still asleep.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Swaddling works every time.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: Uh-huh. Hey, do you want to hold him?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: That's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: Put your arms out. It's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: He smells good.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: He does, doesn't he?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE:  Oh.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Hello, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: Hello.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: Hey, John just taught me a new trick: swaddling.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: That's excellent. I just came to take him so you could have your walk.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Well, great timing, yeah. I've got to get going.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE: Well, thanks for your help, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Welcome.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CLAIRE:  What?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 JIN: 나한테 기대.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 JIN: 나한테 기대.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 JIN: 기대라니까! 내가 부축해 줄게.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 JIN: 기대라니까!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: Shhhh - shut up.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: What? They can't talk at all?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: If he talks he's going to get us all killed.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: By what? Them? I thought they lived a day back that way?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: How about you shut your mouth and get your buddy over here moving?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: What happened to you people? You want us to take you back with us? Fine. But you want me to keep quiet then you need to tell me why I have to.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: They came the first night that we got here. They took three of us. Nothing happened for two weeks, then they came back. They took nine more. They're smart, and they're animals, and they could be anywhere at any time. Now we're moving through the jungle -- their jungle -- just so you can save your little hick friend over here. And if you think that one gun and one bullet is going to stop them -- think again. So shut your mouth and keep moving.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: They took my son.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: They took a lot of things.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: I know what it is to lose someone you care deeply about.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: You really think that this is all about Boone? I saw Walt, Sayid.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Then why are we sitting at Boone's grave.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON:  Just go back, Sayid.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Where are you going?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: To find him.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 NORA:  It came.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Oh my god.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 NORA: Open it.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I can't open it.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 NORA: You what?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: You open it.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 NORA: You have been waiting 6 months for this letter -- no way I'm opening it.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I got it!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 NORA: You got it?1
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I got it!!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 NORA: Oh my god, you're going to New York!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Hello. This is her. Uh, that's impossible. Okay, are you sure? Of course, I will certainly do that. Sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 NORA: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: My rent check bounced.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 NORA: But you're, like, rich.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: I'm sorry, I would have offered you something to drink, but I have to be at a meeting in 10 minutes.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Yeah, um, my checks are bouncing.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: Well, that's what happens when you make withdrawals and don't make deposits, Shannon.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: When do I get the money dad left me? The money from the will.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: There was no will.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: Shannon, your father and I had a living trust. Everything passed to me. I'm afraid there was nothing specifically designated for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Why would he do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: Well, maybe he just wanted you to find your own way. We all have to work, Shannon. Most of us are the better for it.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I can work. I just -- I just got this really prestigious internship. And I'm not going to make any money for a while but I'm going to be working like 16 hours a day.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: The only thing I've ever seen you do 16 hours a day straight is sleep.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I just need to get to New York. I need just something -- something to get started. I'll pay you back.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: This week it's an internship -- last year it was what -- interior design? You'll never pay me back. And you'll only hate yourself even more.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I really want this, Sabrina. I can do this.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SABRINA: I'm sorry, Shannon. You're on your own.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: Oh, double-6's, how nice for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE:  Lucky.  I hope you didn't get the wrong idea seeing me with the baby?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: What wrong idea would that be?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: You and Claire are close, and you spend a lot of time with Aaron -- I just wouldn't want to overstep my bounds.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: Did she tell you we had a fight?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: She didn't say it was a fight.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: She was going to give it up, you know -- for adoption. Did she tell you that?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Yeah, when I built the cradle.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: Ah, of course, when you built the cradle.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Why do you ask?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: She's got a bit to learn about being a mum -- responsibility and all.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Hmmm, now that's an interesting thing to say -- for a heroin addict.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CHARLIE: Recovering addict.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LOCKE: Recovering. It's your turn.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BERNARD:  Here, let me help you.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 JIN: 아냐, 아냐.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: I got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 JIN: 나 혼자도 할 수 있어.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: I said I got it, man. Take a break.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 JIN: 안 쉬어도 돼.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER:  What? You suddenly give a damn about me?  Leave me alone. Both of you. I got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: Hey, hey, hey  Okay. Hey, Sawyer, hey you okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER:  I would have left you behind.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: Shut up, man. Don't try that.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAWYER: I did leave you behind.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: Yeah, well, good thing I ain't you.  No, no, hey, Sawyer. Sawyer, hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 JIN: Water! Water!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LIBBY: Here you go. Here, here.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL:  What's the matter with him?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LIBBY: Well, the fever -- he's got an infection -- he's dehydrated.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: We gotta keep moving.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: We gotta keep going.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 JIN: 소이어를 두고 갈 순 없어!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: You wanna stay, that's fine. But we're rolling out.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BERNARD: We can't just leave him, Ana.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LIBBY: Maybe if we just rest a little while, he'll regain consciousness.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: Rest? Here? Do you remember what happened to us? What they did to us? You remember Goodwin?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 CINDY: Ana's right, maybe we should just push on.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: Hey, you know what? I don't remember Goodwin. And I'm really sorry about whatever happened to him, but I don't care. Mr. Eko, can you help me make a stretcher? And Bernard, I need 4 sticks -- sturdy ones -- about 5 feet long.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BERNARD: Yeah, got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: You're going to carry your friend.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: Yeah, we're going to carry him.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Why are you doing this, Shannon?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I didn't ask you to follow me.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: No, you'd rather be out here alone and get lost or hurt.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I don't need your help, Sayid.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Walt is not out here. You're following a Labrador, not a Bloodhound -- in an effort to find a boy who's on a raft in the middle of the ocean.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: He's not on the raft.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: We found the bottle on the beach.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: The bottle with the messages that they brought with them?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I know he's out here somewhere. I saw Walt. And the raft is gone, and he is all alone.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Shannon.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL:  F*** me...
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: Cindy. Cindy? Where's Cindy?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BERNARD: She was just here.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: Cindy! Cindy!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BERNARD: I don't know, she was...
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LIBBY: Did they take her?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: How could she just be gone?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BERNARD: Cindy! Cindy!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: I'm going after her.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 EKO:  No, we stay together -- we split up, we give them what they want.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: This is all your fault. We never should have gone through the jungle. You risked our lives to save him and he's already dead. This one's on you.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 MICHAEL: What the hell is that?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 LIBBY:  Oh, god.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 ANA: Run!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: She said no. She knew why I asked for the money.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Can I crash at your place in New York for just a little while -- until I get on my feet.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: I'm leaving New York. She offered me a job.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: You're going to work for your mother?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: It's a really good job, Shannon.  Look, this is all I have right now, but my trust fund's going to kick in at the end of the month. And after that I can absolutely keep you afloat.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Thank you, but I'm going to figure out a way to make my own money.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: But who knows when that's going to be, just take it.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Why, you don't think I can do it?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: I didn't say that.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Do you believe I can, or don't you, Boone?  Okay, you know what, I really want you to just take your money -- go work for your mother -- I don't want it...
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: Shannon, it's just money...
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Just take it, alright!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 BOONE: I'm trying to help you, Shannon!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: I don't want your money!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Shannon! Are you okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Do not help me up.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Let's go back.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Why don't you believe me?  I need you to believe in me.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: I do believe in you.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: You don't! No one does. They think that I'm some kind of joke. They think I'm worthless.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Shannon, you are not worthless.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: You say that now, but you don't -- you're just going to leave me. I know as soon as we get out of here you're just going to leave me.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: I will never leave you. I love you and I believe you.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: You do?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: I believe you.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 WALT: Shhh.
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Do you see him?
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Walt! Walt! Walt! Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Shannon!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SHANNON: Walt! Wait!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Shannon!
Lost.Season02.Episode06 SAYID: Shannon! Shannon.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ZACH: Emma -- my sister, my sister. Emma! Emma!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: I'll be right back.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: She's not breathing.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA: Watch out.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: Come with me.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO:  Don't look. She will be fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Good, let it out. You okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EMMA: Where's my mom?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: I don't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EMMA: She's meeting us in Los Angeles.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 YELLING MAN: Help! Help! Anybody see my wife? Pam!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: We're not there yet. I promise, we're going to get you home soon, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: Excuse me, would you look after the children? There is something I have to do.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 CINDY: Uh, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO:  Stay with this nice woman. I'll be back in a minute.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 DONALD: Ow, my leg, my leg! Is it bad? It's bad, isn't it?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: No, it's not that bad. I broke my leg skiing up at Stowe in Vermont. I was on this run -- going pretty fast -- I was racing this cute ski patrol guy. I went off this mogul, lost my edge and, bam!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: Snapped my left leg. Now that -- that was bad.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: You a doctor?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: A year of med school before I dropped out. I'm a clinical psychologist. You saved that girl's life -- you a doctor?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN:  Help! Hey, I need some help! There's somebody in the jungle, come on. He's alive!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: Help! Please help me! Help! Help!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: We should climb up there -- I'll hold him steady, you pull him...
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: No, wait.  What's your name?!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: Bernard!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: You're going to be alright, Bernard. I need you to unbuckle your seat belt and grab the branch next to you!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD:  Is he dead? I think he's dead.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: We should climb up there.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: No.  I need you to focus, Bernard! Unbuckle your seatbelt!  Now grab the branch next to you!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: I don't think I can do that.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Those seats are going to fall.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Come on, you can do it. Bernard!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Alright, hold on tight, okay! I'm coming up to get you!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: Does anybody have any water?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA:  You couldn't find any matches?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Dry ones? You can ask around but I couldn't find any. It'll be dark soon, let me get a signal fire started so they can find us.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: What are you, a boy scout?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Grown up version -- I'm in the Peace Corps.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: They still have that?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: I'm just happy somebody your age actually knows what it is.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: What's your name?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Goodwin.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: I'm Ana Lucia.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: I heard that you were the one who pulled the dead bodies out of the water.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: Were any of them African-American?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: Oh, it's my wife -- I can't find her.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: I will pray for her.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: Where the hell are the rescue planes?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: I will pray for them, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: What was that?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Libby, watch the kids.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Over here.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY:  It's alright. It'll be okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: No wallets, no cell phone, no keys. Nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA:  Hey, are you okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN:  Look, 3 of the people are missing -- the blond guy, the curly-haired guy, and the German who was helping us with the injured.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Did you see anything?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: No, I didn't.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Where did they come from? How many there were?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: No, I didn't see anything. Who are these people?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: I don't know. They're out here in the jungle with no shoes, nothing in their pockets, no labels on their clothes. These people were here before us.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: We need to get off the beach. We need to find a safer place.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: We've got kids and people that are seriously hurt. Where are we going to go? How are we going to move them? And what about the signal fire? How are we going to get rescued if we're off the beach?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Nathan's right.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: They have satellites -- the black box -- we don't need a fire for them to find us.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 CINDY: Yes, we do. Before the crash, the pilot said we'd lost communication; we were turning back. We were flying for two hours in the wrong direction. They don't know where to look.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: It's Donald, his leg. The infection is getting worse. He'll be the 4th to go.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: What are we supposed to do about that?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY:  Would you like some chicken? You haven't said a word in a week. Why aren't you talking? Hey, it wasn't your fault, you know. You were just defending yourself.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: That'll work.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Eh, I heard a pig or something out there. Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow.  What?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Where were you?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: I had to go to the bathroom.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: We have a system for that. We go in pairs.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: Yeah, sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 UNKNOWN VOICE: Behind you! Behind you!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EMMA: Help us, please!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: The kids! They took the kids!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: They took Jim! and Eli! Nancy's gone! They're gone!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Which way did they go? Which way did they go?!!  Wake up! Wake up!! Who are you? Talk to me. Wake up!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: She's dead. She's dead.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: What are you doing?  Is that a knife?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: What is that?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: It's a list.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: A list of what?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: 9 -- of us.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA:  Nothing? They drag 9 people into the jungle -- the kids -- and there's no sign of them?  Now's not a good time to talk? What needs to happen to make you say something?!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: Hey, calm down, let's figure this out.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Calm down? Let's figure this out? Here are the names of every single person they took -- all 9 of them -- what they were wearing -- what they look like -- one of them had a list of us.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: They could have gotten our names from the people they already took.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Nobody knew anybody's names the first night.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: Maybe they're watching us?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: You were gone for 2 hours yesterday.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Where were you?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: I was going to the bathroom.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Hey, stop! We're all scared. Let's not get paranoid here. We don't know anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: He's right. Why would they try to infiltrate us -- that's crazy.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: Well, whoever they are they know we are here. We need to leave this beach.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA:  You said we needed to keep the signal fire burning.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: I think it's time we let it go out.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: 5 minutes.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: We've been walking for 3 days straight, Ana.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: And you're still here. 5 minutes.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: You know what? You want to keep walking, go ahead -- fresh water -- rock wall at our backs -- lots of fruit trees -- right here looks pretty good to me.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Fine, okay. This'll work.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY:  Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: Back at the beach -- the night they came back -- you said that Nathan was gone for 2 hours? That he was missing? Creeps me out, Ana. Do you really think it's possible that one of us is one of them?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Why do you think I'm digging this hole?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: Are we really going to be able to catch rabbits with this?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: Oh yeah, give me another stick.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD:  Oh, hey, Ana.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: Ana?!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: You and I are going to have little talk, Nathan.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: You, let me out of here right now. You let me out. You let me out!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: He wasn't on the plane.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: We were in the air for 2 hours -- I didn't see him once -- not once.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: It's a big plane, Ana, just because you didn't...
Lost.Season02.Episode07 CINDY: No, I didn't see him either. I'm pretty good with faces, you know, with the passengers, and I did not see him.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: You're not all serious.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: He never talks about himself, Nathan. Every time I ask him anything, he just dodges.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: No, if he really were one of them why would he still be here?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN:  Will you let me out, Ana?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA:  You got a problem with this?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN:  What are you doing? Let me out.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Where are the kids? Where are the kids? Where are you from, Nathan?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: Canada.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: What were you doing in Australia?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: Company retreat.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Where are they?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: The rest of your retreat -- where are they?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: They weren't on the plane. I stayed a couple extra days to sight-see.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: How come nobody saw you on the plane, Nathan?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: I was in the lavatory.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: For 2 hours?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: I don't remember seeing you on the plane, Ana Lucia.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: That's because you weren't on it.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Where are the kids, Nathan? Where are the kids? Not talking to me anymore? What's that behind you? Get up!  I said get up! 
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA:  Who gave him food?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 CINDY: What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: I'm trying to find out what they did to us.  And you're taking care of him?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: I didn't do anything. And what if you're wrong, Ana? We don't even know if there is a spy.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Whose idea was it to stay at the beach where they could pick us off one by one -- his -- Nathan's.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: Well, they haven't come since you put him in there.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Who did it?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: You?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: I'm worried about you, Ana. You've had him down there 4 days.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: I promised that little girl that I would get her back home to her mom.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Do you have any kids, Ana?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: We should let him go. We're not savages.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: If I were a savage I would have cut off his finger already. That's tomorrow.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Grab the rope. I'll pull you up.  Ana Lucia's -- I think we all think that she's going to hurt you. Now, you need to get away from here.  There's some fruit in there, now just go.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 NATHAN: Which way's the beach?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: That way, maybe 5 miles.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Morning.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Morning.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 CINDY:  Ana Lucia, he's gone!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 CINDY: He's gone. Nathan's gone.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: Ana, what are you going to do?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: They found us, it's time to move.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 CINDY: What is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: I don't know -- some sort of bunker.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: Do you think it's theirs?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: What is this place?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: It looks like some sort of storage facility.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Hey, come over here.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: What was that? Get it.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: What else in here?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY:  It's a glass eye.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD:  Look at this. It's a radio.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: Hello? Hello, can anybody hear me?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN:  The hills are blocking it. If we want a signal we need to get to higher ground. I'll do it.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: I'll go with you.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Nah, you should stay here, Ana -- get this place set up as a shelter.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: We can all get it set up. We can make it back in a couple of hours, let's go.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Why do you think they're doing this?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Why do I think who's doing what?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Them. Don't you ever wonder why they attack us?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Maybe they're not attacking us.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then -- no real harm done.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Good point.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Why do you think they take some of us and not the others?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: That first night they took the strongest of us -- our quiet friend -- three other guys. They're all athletic, tough, threats.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: They didn't take you.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Guess they changed their plan after two of them got killed. Want to take a break?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Yeah, that's a good idea.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Can I have the knife?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Thank you. Where do you think they got it? I mean, they don't even wear shoes. How'd they get an army knife?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Sorry?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: The knife -- it's U.S. military. Here  I'll show you. You see the tang stamp?  This knife's probably 20 years old. You don't see these anymore, yet here it is, on this Island. Weird, huh? Can I ask you something?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Sure, Ana.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: When you ran out of the jungle the day of the crash -- how did you find Bernard up in the tree?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: I heard him shouting from the beach.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: From the beach?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Why are you asking me about that, Ana?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Did he see you out there? Is that why you pretended to be one of us? You ran out of the jungle 10 minutes after the crash, you weren't wet. You were never even in the ocean. Where are they -- your friends? Nathan -- what did you-
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: If you had cut off his finger and he still told you he was on the plane, I think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Did you kill him?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Nathan was not a good person. That's why he wasn't on the list.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: What about the kids? Did you kill them, too?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 GOODWIN: Children are fine. They're better off now.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 CINDY: Where's Goodwin?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: We're safe here now.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Why are you wasting your time with that thing? There's no signal.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: I only turn it on a couple minutes a day. It really doesn't...
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BOONE:  Hello. Hello, anybody out there? Mayday. Mayday.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: Is there someone there?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BOONE: Hello! Hello!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 CINDY: Who is that? Oh my god!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BOONE: Can you hear me?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: Repeat your transmission, please.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BOONE: Hello. We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815! Please copy!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: We're the survivors of flight 815.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: No, wait a minute. What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: It's them.  It's them. They're trying to draw us out -- trying to find us.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: No, he said 815; he said flight 815.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: They know our flight number because Goodwin knew our flight number.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: What if there really are other survivors out there?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: There are no survivors. This is our life now. Get used to it.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: What are you looking at?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: Going to be okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: What, you're talking now?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: It's been 40 days.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: You've been waiting 40 days to talk?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: You waited 40 days to cry.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 CINDY: Libby.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 CINDY: Turn him over.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 LIBBY: Is he alive? Get Ana Lucia, quick!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: Who are you? Where are you from?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 JIN: 
Lost.Season02.Episode07 BERNARD: He doesn't even speak English.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: That doesn't mean anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 CINDY: Ana, we found him in the water.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: He has a broken hand cuff on his wrist.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: I'm not sure that he's a threat.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: He's running!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 JIN:  Michael, Sawyer!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 SAWYER: Jin!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 JIN: Others! Others! Others!
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: Hit me.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 EKO: Hit you?
Lost.Season02.Episode07 ANA LUCIA: You think they're okay? Let's find out. Hit me.
Lost.Season02.Episode07 MICHAEL: What was that?!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MATTHEW: So how're you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Well, the family with the screaming baby moved.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MATTHEW: You must be thrilled.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Actually, it's too quiet now.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MATTHEW: So, how's Danny -- you two trying to work things out?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: There's nothing to work out. He left.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MATTHEW: You okay with that?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: I guess you could say I'm one of those people that's just better off alone.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MATTHEW: So, how was the firing range?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Good.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MATTHEW: How did it feel to hold a gun again?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Very good.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MATTHEW: All these steps count, Ana. You've come a long way since we met 4 months ago.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Did she say -- you know, when I can come back to work?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MATTHEW: She left the final determination up to me.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Right.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MATTHEW: Do you think you're ready?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: What do you think?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MATTHEW:  Welcome back to the force, Officer Cortez.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Sayid! Sayid, no!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Hey, hey!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA:  Don't move! Nobody move!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Nobody move! Nobody!  Does he have anything else on him?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: He just had a gun to your neck -- check to see if he had anything else on him?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Hey, put it down.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA:  Stop.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Are you crazy? Don't point that at me?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: I said stop!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: What is your problem, huh?!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BERNARD: Ana!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JIN: 야, 너 미쳤어?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Get back! Get back, both of you!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Are you crazy?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LIBBY: Ana.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Now!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LIBBY: Ana!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA:  We need to tie him up.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: I'm not tying him up.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: He tried to kill you.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA:  You, you do it. Tie him. Use the vines from the stretcher.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Hey, if we take that thing apart we won't be able to...
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Shut up!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LIBBY: Ana, Sawyer needs a doctor or he'll die.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: I know what I'm doing.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: I hope this is all of it.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 RAGGS: That's all we've got right now.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 RAGGS: Thanks, Captain.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: Come on in.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 RAGGS: Hey, look who's here. Good to see you Ana Lucia, welcome back.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Thanks, Raggs.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 RAGGS: I'll get you those IRs, Captain.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: Today.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 RAGGS: You've got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN:  How are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Good. Fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: Good. Your assignment.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Evidence? You're putting me behind a desk?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: Is that a problem?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: I want patrol.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: I don't care what you want.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Just put me in a car.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: You were in an officer involve shooting -- no.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA:  
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: Both.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: I need to be back on the street. Please.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: I put you in a car -- everyone's going to know I pulled strings. You don't want me to treat you like my daughter? Don't ask for favors.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Then transfer me.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: You don't get the transfer, but I'll give you the car. Happy?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 RAGGS: Sorry to bother you Captain -- Ana, there's a call for you in the bullpen, they say it's real important.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Thanks, Raggs, I'll be right there.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: They got you a cake, try and act surprised.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ROSE: Jack, nice to see you out of the Hatch. You could use more sunshine.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: I'll take that under advisement.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ROSE: A little fruit might do you good, too. Good for the constitution -- at least that's what they say.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Well, if that's what they say. 
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ROSE: Mmmm?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Where'd you get these?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ROSE: Well, now just because you're a little excited -- no reason to talk with your mouth full.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 HURLEY: Past the hanging tree, double or nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: You sure?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 HURLEY: Dude, double or nothing, there's no way you're hitting it that far.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CHARLIE: Hurley, the woman's on bloody steroids.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: Double's 10 thousand bucks.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CHARLIE: Oh, that's nothing to someone who's worth 150 million dollars. He'll build you your own course, if you'd like.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 HURLEY: Ignore him, he's an idiot.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 HURLEY: Crap!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK:  You hooked it. Try keeping your left arm straight.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: You giving me tips?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Kate, I'm -- I'm a doctor.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: So, you think you could do better?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK:  Anyone can hit a ball. That's not golf.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: And what's golf?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Golf is accuracy.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: Well, why don't we play a few holes and see which one of us is more accurate.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CHARLIE: Oooh, fighting talk.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: You're kidding, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: 3 holes, no handicap, we play for bragging rights. What are we waiting for?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LIBBY: Ana, let's just get to their camp. It was an accident; they'll understand.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: They'll understand? I killed one of them.  If those two move, shout.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LIBBY: Wait, what are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: Untie me.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: I'm not-
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: Untie me!!!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LIBBY: Ana.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: I'm taking him back to his camp.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Don't leave, please. If that were you, he'd let you die.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: I'm not doing it for him. I'm doing it for me.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: So'd the shrink give you any good drugs?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA:  Not that kind of shrink.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: Did you miss me?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Boy, did I.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: I heard about you and Danny. Want me to go kick his ass for you?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Nah. It's better this way. What are we doing in Westwood?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: I thought a change of scenery would be nice -- a nice safe neighborhood for your first day back.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: This was her idea, wasn't it?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: She is the Captain.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 POLICE RADIO VOICE: 809, please respond to a domestic disturbance call at 2210 South Veteran.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: This is 8 Adam-16.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: That's not our call.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 POLICE RADIO VOICE: Go ahead Adam-16.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: We're just 3 blocks from away from that call on Veteran. We got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 POLICE RADIO VOICE: Copy that, 8 Adam-16.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SHAWNA: Where are you going? What are you doing?! Drop the TV, Travis. The TV's mine.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 TRAVIS: I bought it with my money.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SHAWNA: Liar!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 TRAVIS: Did you call the cops?!!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SHAWNA: What?!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 TRAVIS: Do something useful, Shawna, shut your trap!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SHAWNA: Arrest him; he is stealing my TV! He cannot get away with this!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 TRAVIS: She hit me! She hit me!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: Hey, enough, all of you! Both of you!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA:  Put your hands where I can see them! Get down on the ground!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: Officer Cortez!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Ma'am, get your baby upstairs.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: Ana Lucia!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Hands on the ground!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: Ana Lucia! He is down. Holster your weapon. Now.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LIBBY: Hey, I think you should let him go.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: No. He's going to come after me.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LIBBY: You don't know that.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: I killed someone he loves.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Sit down. Now.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: I'm bringing him water. You going to shoot me? Shoot me.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Don't even think of untying him.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: Who is that woman?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Her name is Ana Lucia. She was on the plane -- tail section -- they all were. We were bringing them back.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: Where is Walt?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: They took him -- the Others.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: What do you mean they took him?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: From the raft -- the night we left.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Hey, man. Hey, we're going to get out of this, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Guess you're first.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: Lucky me.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: You know the lady's tee at my golf club back home is about 10 feet closer so if you...
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: Shut up, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Nice.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: You're up.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: Wow, you really put it in there.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: We have more balls; you could always just take a drop.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: I'm good.  Got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: You may want to move.  What?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: Where is the doctor?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: I got him. I got him.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: Where are we headed?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Bathroom. He's burning up. We've got to get him in the shower -- bring his fever down.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: What can I do?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Okay, go through the medical stash; there's a bottle of Ofloxacin...
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: Ofloxacin.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Ofloxacin -- little white pills. Bring the alcohol and some gauge patches, and strip that bed and make sure it has clean sheets on it. Kate?!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: Uh, yeah, yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LOCKE: What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: John, the button.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LOCKE: Hello.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: Hello.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BERNARD:  Hey, what are we doing here, Ana? I mean, their camp has got to be close. I just want to get back to my wife.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: How long have I kept you alive out here, Bernard?  That's right. So cut me some slack.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LIBBY: Hey, we just want to know what you're doing. What's the plan?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: She has no plan. She only has her guilt and a gun.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: You want a plan?  Do you have any ammo, back at your camp?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Ammo -- for the gun -- do you have any back at your camp?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yeah, a couple boxes.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Alright, I want it -- at least half. And I'll need a pack -- a big one -- a blanket, some medicine, clothes -- jeans and socks -- you getting all this?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yeah, I got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Alright, you bring all of that stuff back to me and I'll let your friend go.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: I'm not leaving them.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LIBBY: Michael, you should.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: No. We stay together.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JIN: Go. 사이드를 절대로 다치게 할 수는 없어.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL:  I'll be back, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LIBBY: Ana, what are you doing? You can't live out here alone.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: I'm already alone.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: I'll sign us out.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: What, you talking to me, now?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: I just want to go home A-L.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Hey, I ordered that guy to stop twice.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BIG MIKE: So does that mean every time we run into some yo-yo with a TV in his hands, you're going to draw down?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 RAGGS:  Hey, Ana Lucia -- your guy -- we got him.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: His name is Jason McCormick. We picked him up on an assault on an elderly woman in Echo Park. His fingerprints matched a partial from your crime scene. We questioned him and he confessed. The D.A. is ready to file charges -- all he needs is for you to I.D. him.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: It's not him.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: He confessed.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: I don't know him.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN:  Can you guys give us a minute?  Why are you doing this?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Because it's not him.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 CAPTAIN: He put 4 bullets into you -- hollow points through your vest -- he tried to kill you. You want a list of his priors? You want to put this guy back out on the street?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: It's not him.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LOCKE: What happened? Out there -- what happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: There was an accident.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LOCKE: What kind of accident?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: A girl was shot and killed.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LOCKE: What did she look like?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: She was tall with blonde hair. There was an Arab man...
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LOCKE: Shannon. You said there were 5 of you from the tail section?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: 4.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LOCKE: 4 -- why didn't the rest of them come back with you? And Michael, Jin?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: They cannot come back right now.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LOCKE: Can you take me to them?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO:  No.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: Here you go. What's happening? Why is he shaking?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: He's septic. The infection's gotten into the blood stream. If the anti-biotics don't bring the fever down he'll go into shock. Hold him up.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: Okay, I've got him.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Swallow it, swallow it, swallow it.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: I'll do it.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: No, no, I've got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: I can do it.  Sawyer? Hey, you have to listen to me, okay? The only way that you are going to get better is if you take this pill. So I want you to swallow it, okay? Okay, here we go.  Now swallow, swallow. Good, good.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Nice job. I never learned the whole whisper-in-the-ear thing in med school.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 BERNARD: I'm going, Ana. I don't want to be a part of this. I know everything you've done for us, and I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for you. But I'm going.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA:  What about you?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LIBBY: I just don't think you're the best judge of character. I was with you when you put Nathan in the pit.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Alright, you want to go? Go. Leave.  You -- go.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Get out of here. Go.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SUN: Michael!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Hi. Listen, it's alright. Jin is okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SUN: Where is he?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: He's fine; and I'll explain. But right now, I need to find Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK:  Where are they?  I said, where are they?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LOCKE: Jack, it's not his fault...
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Shannon's dead! I'm not...  You're going to take me back out there, right now.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LOCKE: This man isn't the problem. He brought Sawyer back.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Half-dead with a bullet hole in his shoulder, John!  Are you going to talk to me or are you just going to sit there?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: Anything I say will only make you angry. So, yes, I will sit here.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SUN:  Jack! Jack! Jack!
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Michael. 
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: We've got a problem, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: You remember how to get out there, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yeah, I think so.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 LOCKE: We should stop and think about this, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Think about what, John? Shannon's dead, Sayid's being held at gunpoint. You want to sit and hope that situation resolves itself -- be my guest.  You know how to use this?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yes, sir.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: Stop! Please. What do you want?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Excuse me?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: Peace? Revenge? Justice? And you are going out with all these guns? What do you want?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: I want all of our people back here safely. Your friend murdered-
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: Ana Lucia made a mistake.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: What did you say?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: Ana Lucia made a mistake.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Ana Lucia.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 EKO: I will take you there. But only you, and no guns.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JACK: Let's go.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Where are you from?  Where are you from?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: I'm from Iraq.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Do you have any kids?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: Why are you asking me if I have children?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: I'm curious.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: I do not. Do you have children?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: Are you going to kill me? That's what you're thinking about, isn't it?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Should I?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: Almost 40 days ago on this very Island I tied a man to a tree and tortured him. I tortured him as I've tortured many men -- men whose voices I still hear in the night. Should you kill me? Maybe you should. Maybe you were meant to.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: I'm a cop... I was a cop. One night my partner and I responded to a burglary call. We were the first ones there. I covered the front and he went around the back. I was there a minute and then this kid comes right through the front door -- I tell him to put his hands up -- and he says I'm making a mistake -- that he's a student and he wants to show me his I.D. I believed him. I just -- I let him reach. All I remember was a pop. By the time I hit the ground I thought I was dead. I feel dead.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: What happened to him -- the man who shot you?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Hey, Jason.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 JASON: I know you?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA:  I was pregnant.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: What happened to him?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 ANA LUCIA: Nothing. They never found him.  Go ahead, pick it up, I deserve it.
Lost.Season02.Episode08 SAYID: What good it would be to kill you if we're both already dead?
Lost.Season02.Episode08 KATE: Hey! Hey, can you hear me? You're going to be okay. You're going to be alright. You're home.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Sorry, man, I know this hurts. Michael told me you pulled the bullet out with your bare hands. You'll have to show me how to do that sometime.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER:  Where is she?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: What? I didn't...
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER:  Where is she?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: You mean Kate. She's been watching over you for the past 24 hours straight. The only way I could get rid of her was to send her out to get some food for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER:  I love her. I love her.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 WAYNE: Well, heya, girl. What are you doing here?  Hey, there.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE:  Alright, let's get you to bed.  Watch your step, watch your step.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 WAYNE: What the hell is that smell?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Probably your breath.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 WAYNE: Sha, right.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Come on.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 WAYNE: You're beautiful. Hey. Hey! I just gave you a compliment.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Yeah, I heard you. 
Lost.Season02.Episode09 WAYNE: Aren't you going to take my pants off first?  You are beautiful.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE:  Good night.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 DIANE: Coffee, pie, both?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: How about a beer?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 DIANE: I'd like to see some I.D.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: I'm 24, Ma.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 DIANE: You want to ride around on that on that deathtrap of yours without a helmet -- I'm not going to help your cause by getting you drunk.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: How's that wrist?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 DIANE: What, this? You know that shelf in the kitchen sticks out sometimes. You'd think I'd remember it was there, but I banged it.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Don't.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 DIANE: I made my bed, Katherine.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Well, your bed's gone, Ma.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 DIANE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 DIANE: What is this?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: An insurance policy for the house.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 DIANE: What? I never...
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: I took it out in your name.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 DIANE: What did you do? Does Wayne know about this?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE:  Just remember that you were here and you didn't see me, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 DIANE: Katherine! What did you do?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: I took care of you, Ma. I've got to go and you're not going to see me for awhile.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 DIANE:  Katherine, what did you do? Katherine!
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Hey. You okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm just -- I think I'm tired. How is he?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: His fever's still up there. I can't tell if the anti-biotics are working. It'll help to get some food in him. You should get down to the beach for -- for Shannon.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: I was actually thinking that I should stay and watch Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: I'll stay with him.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: You should be there.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Keep him hydrated -- maybe mash up some of that fruit and see if you can get him to eat it. And everybody'll be at the beach, so don't forget the button.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: I got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: I'll be back in a couple of hours. -- You're sure you're okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Yeah, I'm great.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 ANA: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 EKO: I'm going to go to the funeral.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 ANA: I don't think I'm going to make it.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 EKO: I think most of them realize it was an accident, Ana.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAYID: Shannon and I were strangers. We never would have met if... We wouldn't even have spoken if... But we did meet and we did speak. At least... I loved her.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: May she rest in peace.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: You hungry? I'm just going to mash you up some fruit here. When you wake up you're going to get a kick out of me feeding you like a baby. I saw a horse. Yeah, that's what happens when you don't sleep.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER: 
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Sawyer? Are you awake?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER: 
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER:  Why did you kill me?  Why did you kill me?!
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: It's the alarm.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Kate! Kate!
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: 4, 8, 15, 16, 22. Gah.  23, 42.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Well, you said-
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: I don't know, John!
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Well, where's Kate?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 CHARLIE: Kate, hey. You missed the funeral.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Yeah, uh, I was with Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 CHARLIE: Oh, right. A few of them came -- the new people. Not her -- the one who killed Shannon. That would have been a bit awkward. They seem to have had a rough time of it. It looks like they went bloody Lord of the Flies out there.  You haven't listened to a word I've said.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Do you think there are horses here?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: I think I saw a horse in the jungle.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 CHARLIE: I've seen polar bears. I've seen monsters, well, heard monsters, but horses, no.  Kate! Where are you going?!
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Tallahassee one-way, please.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 GUY IN LINE: Tallahassee? I spent a week in Tallahassee one night. It's all strip malls and waffle houses. What's a pretty girl like you going to do down in Tallahassee?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: I'm sure I'll find something.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 GUY IN LINE: I'll bet you've got family down there, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Actually, I'm just visiting.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MARSHAL: Hey, hey, don't I know you?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: No, I don't think so. 
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MARSHAL: Don't run, Kate.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MARSHAL: I've got her. Kate Austen, you're under arrest for murder.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: I didn't do anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MARSHAL: Oh, yeah you did. Your mama gave you up, Kate.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Charlie, have you seen Kate?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 CHARLIE: A little while ago in the jungle. She was acting kind of barmy, asking me about horses on the island.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: You know where she is now?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 CHARLIE: She's on the path heading back to the caves. Everything okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Yeah, Charlie, everything's fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JIN:  Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Free at last, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MICHAEL: Yeah, man. Looks good.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MICHAEL: Hey, Locke, what's up with the blast doors?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Blast doors?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MICHAEL: Yeah, like in case of an explosion they come from the ceiling. That guy down here, uh...
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Desmond?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MICHAEL: Desmond. He didn't tell you about these -- what they're for?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: No, no he didn't. But he did leave a movie.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MICHAEL: A movie?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Yeah. You want to see it?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 EKO:  I would like to see it too -- if you don't mind.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Why not? The more the merrier.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Kate, what the hell are you doing out here? What happened in the hatch, Kate? Why'd you leave? I come back, I find Sawyer just lying on the ground. You just took off...
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Is he okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Yes, Kate, he's fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I am not as perfect as you! I'm sorry that I'm not as good!
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Okay, what's going on with you?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Just forget it.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK:  No, don't walk away from me.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE:  Let go of me. Just...
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: No. Kate.  Kate, Kate, Kate.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Don't! I've got... 
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK:  It's okay. It's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Please, this place is crazy -- it's just -- I can't -- it's driving me nuts.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: I know. It's okay. It's alright. It's alright.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Kate!
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MARVIN CANDLE: From the moment the alarm sounds you will have 4 minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor  induction into the program. When the alarm sounds, either you or your partner must input the code. It is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts. In this manner you will stay as fresh and alert  utmost importance that when the alarm sounds the code be entered correctly, and in a timely fashion. Do not attempt to use the computer  for anything . Congratulations, until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands. On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso and all of us at the DHARMA Initiative, thank you. Namaste. And good luck.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MICHAEL: Alright, so you've been pushing that button every 2 hours since you got down here.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: That's right.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MICHAEL: How does that even work?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: I set up 2 person shifts -- 6 hours -- everyone's on the roster.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MICHAEL: Don't they want to know why?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: I think the film's pretty self-explanatory.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MICHAEL: Really? All I heard was something about electro-magnets and an incident. What about all the missing pieces?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Oh, you mean the splices? Yeah, just a frame here and there, I think -- nothing important.  What do you think? About the film -- what do you think?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: I'm sorry I missed it -- her funeral -- I had to be with Sawyer, so...
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAYID: Why aren't you with him now?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Because I'm going crazy. Do you believe in ghosts, Sayid?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAYID: I saw Walt in the jungle just before Shannon was shot. Does that make me crazy?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MARSHAL: It's a long drive back to the arraignment, you comfy?  Why now?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MARSHAL: Nice, corn fed farm girl like yourself -- no history of violence, straight A's, no record, couple of speeding tickets... I just got to wonder, why'd you kill him now?  Oh, right, yeah, don't tell me. You wouldn't want to incriminate yourself, not after you were so smart planning it. That jury back in Iowa sure ain't going to get hung up on pre-meditation. And a gas leak, come on, it's -- it's amateur hour from top to bottom.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Sounds like you've got it all figured out.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MARSHAL: I do have you all figured out.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: You don't know anything about me.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MARSHAL: White trash mom divorces dad, starts up with some guy who's a drinker. Then he knocks her around a little bit, she marries him, because, you know, that's what happens. And then this drunk, this Wayne, he moves into your house, and you get to lay there every night and listen to him doing your mom right there in your daddy's old bedroom. And even that wouldn't be so bad if he didn't beat her up all the time. But she loves him. She defends him. If that don't make a person want to kill somebody I don't know what does. But the question is now, why now? Why after all these years did you just decide to blow poor Wayne up? He come knocking on your door late at night?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: He never touched me.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MICHAEL: Why can't you just put the numbers in now?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: It doesn't work that way. The alarm goes off at 4 minutes. You can't type anything until then. 
Lost.Season02.Episode09 MICHAEL: You mind if I check out some of this hardware?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Sure. -- Just don't break it.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Hello again.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 EKO: Hello. I have something I think you should see. If you don't mind, I will begin at the beginning. Long before Christ the king of Judah was a man named Josiah.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Boy when you say beginning, you mean -- beginning.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 EKO: At that time the temple where the people worshiped was in ruin. And so the people worshiped idols, false gods. And so the kingdom was in disarray. Josiah, since he was a good king, sent his secretary to the treasury and said: "We must rebuild the temple. Give all of the gold to the workers so that this will be done." But when the secretary returned, he had no gold. And when Josiah asked why this was, the secretary replied, "We found a book." Do you know this story?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: No, I'm afraid I don't.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 EKO: What the secretary had found was an ancient book -- the Book of Law. You may know it as the Old Testament. And it was with that ancient book, not with the gold, that Josiah rebuilt the temple. On the other side of the island we found a place much like this, and in this place we found a book.  I believe what's inside there will be of great value to you.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 HURLEY: Hey.  So, Rose's husband's white. Didn't see that one coming.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Is there something you need, Hurley?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 HURLEY: No, just taking a walk, thought I'd say hey. -- Who's taking care of Sawyer?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Sun is.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 HURLEY: So, you're like, mad at him?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK:  Why would I be mad at Sawyer?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 HURLEY: Maybe because he's the one that always comes down here and chops wood, and now you are? It's like, transference.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: What, are you a shrink now?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 HURLEY: Well, that's what they call it in the mental hospital.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: I'm not mad at anyone.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Where's Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SUN: I don't know. He didn't come back.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Has he said anything?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SUN: Sawyer? No, he's still sleeping. Can you watch him?  I can stay with...
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Yeah, I -- I can.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SUN: Thanks. 
Lost.Season02.Episode09 AUSTEN: Right, uh-huh. Yes, I'm sure that's the exact one you have, uh-huh. I'll send one over to you, right.  I'll call you back later.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Hi, Dad.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 AUSTEN: Katie, the police and the U.S. Marshals are looking for you. You shouldn't have come here.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: I've been waiting outside for 2 hours, they're not here.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 AUSTEN: Is it true what they're saying?  Katie, what'd you come here for?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Why didn't you tell me, Dad?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 AUSTEN: Tell you what?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: I was making a scrapbook -- a surprise for your birthday. So I called one of your COs to get some pictures of you in uniform. The pictures that he sent me had dates on the back -- photos of you in Korea up until 4 months before I was born. Why didn't you tell me that Wayne was my father? Why?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 AUSTEN: I didn't tell you because I knew you'd kill him. And your mother loved him. You were 5 years old. I wanted to take you along with me. She wouldn't let me.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: So why didn't you kill him?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 AUSTEN: Because I don't have murder in my heart. I'm going to have to call them.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Can I have an hour?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Bye, Daddy.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Can you hear me? Sawyer? -- Wayne?  I'm probably crazy and this doesn't matter, but maybe you're in there somehow. But you asked me a question. You asked me why I -- why I did it. It wasn't because you drove my father away, or the way you looked at me, or because you beat her. It's because I hated that you were a part of me -- that I would never be good. That I would never have anything good. And every time that I look at Sawyer -- every time I feel something for him -- I see you, Wayne. It makes me sick.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER: That's about the sweetest thing I've ever heard.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Sawyer?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER: Who the hell's Wayne?  I'm in a bunk-bed?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Yeah, you're in a bunk-bed.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER: Are we saved?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: No, Sawyer. Not yet.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Voilà. What are the odds?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 EKO: The odds?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 LOCKE: Yeah. -- Here, hold this down on the table there nice and flat. I mean, think about it. Somebody made this film. Someone else cut this piece out. We crash -- 2 halves of the same plane fall in different parts of the island -- you're over there, I'm over here. And now, here's the missing piece right back where it belongs. What are the odds?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 EKO: Don't mistake coincidence for fate.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER: You've got to be kidding me.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Air lock's over this way.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER: Come on, admit it, we've been rescued.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE:  You got it? Sorry. Watch yourself.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER:  Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Watch yourself, okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER:  Oh, got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER: Home sweet home.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER: I really thought you were yanking my chain. What do you keep smiling at?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: You need a haircut.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER: Oh, really?  Maybe you ought to take me back inside.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: You see that?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER: If you mean the big ass horse standing in the middle of the jungle, then yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 SAWYER: Do you know that horse, Freckles?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 KATE: Yeah, I do.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Tequila and tonic, that's your drink, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 ANA: Where's the tonic?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: We're running a little low on mixers.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 ANA: You sure you want to waste that on me?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Figured you could use a drink. I know I could.
Lost.Season02.Episode09 ANA: Are you going to try to convince me that everyone here doesn't hate me?
Lost.Season02.Episode09 JACK: Only if you're going to try to convince me that every woman in the world's not crazy.

Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: Thanks. So you're Eko, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: Claire; and this is Aaron.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Aaron? The brother of Moses?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: Yeah, that must have been tough to live up to, right? The pressure of everyone saying, "Why can't you be more like your brother, Moses."
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Yes, I'm sure it was. Why did you choose it -- Aaron?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: I just liked it.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Aaron was a great man. Moses had great difficulty speaking so it was Aaron who spoke for him.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: So you're religious, huh? You should speak to Charlie. He doesn't want to admit he's religious, but he carries around a statue of the Virgin Mary.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Statue?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: Yeah, he says he found it on the island. Weird, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: May I see it?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Where did he find this?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: He said he found it in the jungle.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Where in the jungle?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: I don't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO:  Where?!
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: Look, what are you -- it's just a statue.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Just a statue?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Where is Charlie?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL:  You breaking in or breaking out?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 LOCKE: I used to love those old silent movies where the robbers would crack a combination lock with their ear pressed up against the safe. And the money they stole was always in a white bag with a big dollar sign on it.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Silent movies, huh? You're not that old, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 LOCKE: I'm old enough.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: You set the combination?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 LOCKE: With the new folks joining us I figure we better limit people's access to the guns. Can't have just anyone who wants one walk in and help themselves -- which I'm guessing is why you're here, Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE:  He's got wit he's got charm/But when he gets rough he'll break your arm/He's got taste, manners and grace/But when he gets rough he'll slit your face/He'll buy you jewels, expensive shoes, uh, oooo -- Hey Jin, do you like the Kinks? Kinks?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 JIN: Keens?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: No, man, Kinks. Kinks with a "k" at the end. A kicking ka. Kinks. You know,  Once you're in love, you're not getting out ha-a-a-a so look out. It's a good tune, Jin.  Look out.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 JIN:  너때문에 물고기가 다 도망가잖아!
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Oh, thank you very much, Jin. I do have a beautiful voice, don't I?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO:  Where did you find this?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Where did you find it?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: In the jungle. I found it in the jungle.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Take me there.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 JIN: 왜 그래?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO:  This is not your business.  I want you to take me to where you found it.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Okay, fine. Yeah, we'll go for a stroll -- there's nothing there. We'll go first thing in the morning, alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: We're going now.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Okay, let me go tell Claire so she doesn't get the wrong idea. Wait here --
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Tell her on your way.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 TOUGH MOROCCAN:  Get us some beers. Go.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Where did you find this?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 TOUGH MOROCCAN: What does it matter?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Same in the other bag?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 TOUGH MOROCCAN: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Fifty.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 TOUGH MOROCCAN: Fifty what?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Fifty is what I will pay you in exchange for the favor you are asking me to do.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 TOUGH MOROCCAN: A favor?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: You have a large quantity of heroin in a country that has no poppies and no market for its sale. Your drugs are of no value here, so you must get them out. The borders are all guarded by the military so you must fly. But as I'm sure you are aware the only private planes currently allowed into the air are either U.N. aid or the Catholic missionaries. And so you have come to me for a favor. I will buy your heroin -- for 50.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 TOUGH MOROCCAN: It is true what they say about you.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: And what is that?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 TOUGH MOROCCAN: You have no soul.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO:  No.  Go. Go. And tell your friends that I let you live -- that Mr. Eko let you live.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE:  Just give me a second, okay?  Hi, Claire. What happened to the statue?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: Don't play stupid, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE:  What's this? Because this was in your little statue. And, unless I'm mistaken I seem to remember you saying you're a drug addict.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: I didn't know.  Look, it's sealed up inside a statue, how would I know? Claire, I'm not using.  Look, you believe me now? I don't -- care.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: Someone's waiting for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 LOCKE: Got it?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 LOCKE: Alright. Breath half-way out -- gently squeeze the trigger. Squeeze.  Good.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: How'd you learn all this stuff?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 LOCKE: My dad used to take me hunting.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Hunting for what?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 LOCKE: Birds mostly. Of course, birds don't shoot back.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Yeah. I know people are talking -- thinking I'm going to go running off after Walt again.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 LOCKE: If people are talking I'm not hearing it. But if I was, I'd say it's not a very smart plan.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Yeah, it's not.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 LOCKE:  Let's try one for real.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 LOCKE: Bravo.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Well done with Claire, mate. You got me in a lot of trouble there, so thanks for that. Hope you're happy. Oh, that's right, you don't do happy.  Alright, well, we're here. I found it right here, right by that tree.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: You found it here?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Yeah, found it here.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: You're lying.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: You know what? I don't even know you. You asked to see where I found it. This is where I found it. We're done. Have a nice hike.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: You did not find the statue here. Take me to the plane.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: How'd you know about the plane, man? It's old, you know. It's been out in the jungle for years. Of course, you would know that - you know everything.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Why did you lie to the girl?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: You told her you did not know what was inside the statue.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: I wasn't lying.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Then what is the wrong idea?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: When I showed you the broken pieces of plaster, you said you did not want her to get the wrong idea. What is the wrong idea?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: I don't have to tell you anything, man. You come traipsing across the island, and what, suddenly now you're in charge? You want me to take you to your plane? You best start treating me with some respect. I'm not just some guy you can just...
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: What? What?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Let's go.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE:  Yes, sir.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 NIGERIAN WOMAN: Sir! Sir, if you buy a statue, the money will buy polio vaccine for the village. 200 Naira, sir.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI:  What are you doing here?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: I have come to give my confession.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI:  Hello, Eko.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO:  Hello, brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: So I come to visit you for the first time in 3 years and you won't hear my confession? You know, Monsignor would have said he failed to raise a proper Catholic boy.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: Well, why waste your time confessing. It won't help you.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: It won't?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: No, for confession to mean something you must have a penitent heart.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: You and your guilt, Yemi. I've only done what I needed to do to survive. How is that a sin?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: You may live far from here, but that doesn't mean I haven't heard of who you are and what you have done.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Have you forgotten how you got that cross, brother -- the day they took me? Is what I did that day a sin? Or is it forgiven because it was you that was saved?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: Why are you here, Eko?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: I have come to help you. I have some merchandise that I need to get out of the country. I would like to use one of your church relief flights to transport it.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: Merchandise? You mean drugs.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: It is not my normal business, Yemi. We are moving the drugs out of Nigeria so that they cannot be used by our people. And the money -- you'll have all the money to buy your vaccine. God has given us this opportunity; we should not turn our back on it.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: God did not bring you here, Eko. Your own greed did. I will always love you, but I will not help you. It's good to see you again, brother. 
Lost.Season02.Episode10 SAWYER: A little close to the ear, Freckles. You sure you know what you're doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 KATE: Would you please turn your head.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 SAWYER: Why, you ain't got a clean enough shot at my neck? I can cut my own damn hair.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 KATE: You know, you don't have to be belligerent just for belligerence's sake. Everyone loves you now.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 SAWYER: Bull puckey.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 HURLEY: Yo, Sawyer, glad you're back, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 SAWYER:  Yo yourself, Pillsbury.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 KATE: See?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Hey, Kate? Hey, Locke said you were on hatch duty later. I was wondering if, uh, you mind if I go instead?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 KATE: You want my shift?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Help me take my mind off things.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 KATE: Sure, it's all yours.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Thanks, appreciate it.  Glad you're okay, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 SAWYER: Yeah.  Don't even say anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Alright, time to take a break.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: You just had a break.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: I'm not what you think I am.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: And what do I think you are?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: It was my brother's fault.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Sorry?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: It was his fault I became an addict. He started with the heroin. I tried to make him stop. You don't know me, man. I was a good person. I was an altar boy. Alright, I knew what was in that statue, it doesn't mean I needed what was inside it. So don't judge me, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: What? What's that? It's a parachute.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Is that a priest?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: You know that guy?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Yes, this man saved my life.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE:  He saved your life, huh? Sure, that makes sense. He takes off in a plane in Nigeria -- we're out in the middle of the South Pacific -- that makes all the sense in the world.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: This is scripture written here. You're a priest. You're a priest, right? He's a priest and you're a priest, too, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: I need to talk to you.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: I'm in the middle of a confession.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: It cannot wait.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI:  Bless you.  God be with you all and please come back in the morning.  It's okay.  How dare you come here and disrupt my work?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Have you reconsidered?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: My request?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: Flying drugs under the cover of the church? How is that something I could ever reconsider?  Look, hey, don't touch those!
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: I'm going to make this easy for you. You will make us priests and we will fly the drugs out ourselves.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: Make you priests?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Just sign these ordination documents and I will give you the money for the vaccines.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: Leave this church now, Eko. Go. Now.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Yemi, I understand that you live in a world where righteousness and evil seem very far apart, but that is not the real world. I am your brother and I would never do anything to hurt you, but my friends -- if you do not do what I ask -- they will burn this church to the ground. Is that worth less than the price of your name on a piece of paper? Think of the lives you will save.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: My signature does not make you a priest, Eko. You could never be a priest.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: How many of the statues do you have left? The Virgin Mary statues, how many?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: I don't know -- three hundred.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: I will take all of them.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: I guess we are both sinners now.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: Perhaps we are but God will forgive me, Eko.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Uh, I'm lost. It was dark. I was following Sayid. Right afterwards a big bag of rocks fell on my head so I'm sorry if I'm a bit spotty with the geography.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Climb that tree.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Climb that tree and perhaps you will be able to get your bearings or spot the plane.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: You climb it. What if I don't? You going to beat me with your Jesus stick? I find it a little odd that your scripture stick has dried blood on it.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Are you going to climb that tree, or not?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE:  What kind of priest are you, anyway?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: You need to get higher.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Wonderful. Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Eko, run! Run!
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Did you see it?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Yeah, I saw it. What the bloody hell did you do?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: I did nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Most people, when they see a creature made of swirling black smoke, they run.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: I was not afraid of it.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: I can see that. That thing kills people.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Did you see the plane?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Yes, I saw your plane. It's about a kilometer that way.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO:  Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE:  Wait!
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Come on. Come on. Where are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MONITOR: Dad?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL:  Are you OK?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MONITOR: Yes. Are you alone?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL:  Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MONITOR: Can't talk long. They're coming back soon.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL:  Where are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MONITOR: You need to com...
Lost.Season02.Episode10 JACK: Hey, Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 JACK: How're you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: I'm good, thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 JACK: You down here alone?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Yeah, Hurley's supposed to be here, but, uh, I guess he's running late.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 JACK: Well, listen, uh, no one's forgotten about Walt.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 JACK: I can't -- I don't have any idea what you must be going through, but I just want you to know that as soon as we can we're going to figure a way to go out and bring him back.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Yeah, thanks, man. Thanks. 
Lost.Season02.Episode10 JACK: You okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Yeah, fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 JACK: Well, I'll leave you to it then.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 MICHAEL: Thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 OLU:  Eko.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: What are you doing here, Yemi?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: I came to stop you.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Go back to your church.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: Do not get on that plane, Eko. You saved my life once and now I'm here to save yours.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Save my life?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: Look, if you get on that plane -- if you do this...
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Do what, Yemi?! Are you a prophet now?!
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: Please, Eko! Let me take your confession! Anything I can do, I will do! But please, don't go.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 GOLDIE: He called the military!
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO:  You did this?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI: I did not tell them who was involved. Just leave the drugs and come back with me.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 YEMI:  No! Stop! No more! No more!
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Yemi! No! No!  Help me get to the plane.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Forgive me, forgive me.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 SOLDIER:  Father? Are you okay, Father?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Eko? Who's that?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: He's my brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: For the one I broke.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: So, are you a priest or aren't you?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO:  Yes, I am. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the shadow of the valley of death, I fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod, thy staff they comfort me.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 EKO: Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Claire?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: You lied to me, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: I know I did. I'm sorry. I just -- it made me feel safer to have it around.
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: Look, I can't have you around my baby, okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CHARLIE: Claire, I...
Lost.Season02.Episode10 CLAIRE: Charlie, I don't want you sleeping anywhere near us, okay?! Just go.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN:  Look here and here. You can see it's rotting out the spinal  area, and plus all this extra dural growth -- I'm surprised it hasn't caused permanent ischemia.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 ANGELO:  Digli di smettere di bisbigliare. Non sono un idiota. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA:  He says you don't need to talk in whispers. He knows he doesn't have a chance.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: Your father appreciates candor.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: We both do.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: Well, then tell him I'm very sorry but he's not a candidate for surgery.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA:  Papà, lui è come gli altri. Non lo farà. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: The way the tumor is situated on the spine, it's just not possible to remove it.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 ANGELO: Non ci proverà? Perché? 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: He wants to know why you won't try.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: Because what your father is looking for is not a surgical procedure. What he is looking for is a miracle.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 ANGELO: Signore, non sono venuto fino a qui per lei. Sono venuto qui per suo figlio. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: He said, "I did not come all this way for you, sir. I came for him .
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Ms. Busoni, I, uh...
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: You fixed someone with a crushed spinal column -- an impossible surgery -- and now she walks, yes? I consulted many medical journals before making this trip here.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: Then you should know it's a very different case under very different circumstances.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: But a miracle, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Look, everything that my father's saying -- the risks, the unlikelihood -- he's absolutely right.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: But will you try?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK:  I'll have to admit him in the next couple of weeks, run some tests.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 ANGELO: La ringrazio... tantissimo. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK:  Locke!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: John.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 MICHAEL: Stay in there. Stay...
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Michael, what are you...?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 MICHAEL: Stay in there, Jack!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Hey, whatever's going on...
Lost.Season02.Episode11 MICHAEL: Look, I'm going after my son. I'm going after my son, and nobody is going to stop me, okay?! Okay, that is my right! That is a father's right!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: There's another way to go about this...
Lost.Season02.Episode11 MICHAEL: Get in the damn room!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: You going to shoot me, Michael?!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 MICHAEL: No, but I'll shoot your damn computer. Nothing is not what you think it is anyway. You don't understand, man. You don't have any idea. Now get in there!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Michael, Michael, listen, we can do this together, okay? I'll come with you.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 MICHAEL: No, I have to do it. Now. I have to do it alone.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Michael knocked you out. Look over here 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Why would he...?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: He went after Walt. You feel nauseated, sick?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: No, I'm okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Good. Give me a boost up.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: It's no use. I bolted it shut from the inside.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: You what?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: No point in changing the combination if you can get in through the air vent.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: That's really good thinking, John. You want to tell me why you let Michael in here?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: He wanted a gun -- for shooting practice.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Shooting practice?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE:  The button. How long was I out?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: 20 minutes.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: We're on shift for the next 4 hours. There's nobody coming down here.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Yeah, well, better hope Sawyer shows up to get his band-aid changed.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE: Morning.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Did you just throw a banana at me?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE: Couldn't find any rocks.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER:  There are nicer ways to wake a man up, Freckles.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE: Come on, it's time to go get your bandages changed.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Why can't you do it for me?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE: Because I'm not your nurse, and Jack's got the bandages.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Of course he does.  You want to give me a hand?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE: Come on.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: This place still creeps me out.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE: You'll get used to it. Where is everybody? Jack! John!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Maybe they went out for ice cream.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE:  Shhh.  Jack!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: In here, in the armory. Michael locked us in here.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: What'd he say?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE:  I got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Hope you got the combo, Doc.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Right two times to 25.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: 25, got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Left two times to 29. Right once to 40.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER:  Howdy, boys.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: What are you doing, Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Going after him. .
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Hey, what...? What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Michael went after Walt.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Went after Walt?!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK:  Pulled a gun on me, put us both in there, and went after Walt.  Hey, what are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: What does it look like? I'm coming with you.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: You're still on antibiotics.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: It's a good thing I'm traveling with my doctor, then.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: How is he?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I thought you'd gone home.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: My home is a hotel room. I like it more here.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I think you need to find a better hotel.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: You didn't answer my question.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: His counts aren't where I'd like them to be.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: You've been doing tests for a month now, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I'm thorough.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: I have a confession to make. I don't believe in miracles.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Yeah, I guess I'm not too sure about them, either.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: I bet your wife feels differently. Your wife, she's the woman you fixed, isn't she?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: I'm thorough, too. She must be a very special person to let you work until 4:30 in the morning.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK:  I completely lost track of... I've got to... Will you excuse me?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: Yes, of course, go. And Jack, thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Yeah, of course.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: Good night.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Good night.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: Hey, how is he?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Hey, sorry to wake you.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: I had to get up anyway. So how is he?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: About the same. Sarah, I'm sorry. I meant to... I just got...
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: Hey, that's the price of being a miracle-worker. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Where are you going?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: I have to go to the gym and then I've got some papers to grade.  I didn't want to say anything until I knew either way, but, um, I was late, so, I got a pregnancy test.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: Don't worry. It's negative.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Do you, um, want to talk about it?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: What's to talk about?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Sarah, I...
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: See you later, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Well?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Well, I can't tell you it's definitely Michael's, but it looks like his boot print.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE: There's one over here, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: That sounds like a trail.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE:  You got a gun for me?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: You're not coming.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: You're not coming. Someone has to be here to take care of the button.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE: So why should that person be me? I can track, carry a gun...
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: You're not coming! You're staying. Alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK:  Let's go.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: What'd she do to you?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Kate, what'd she do?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: She didn't do anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Right, yelling at her because she wanted to help get Mike back makes a lot of sense.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Why don't you go back and see if I hurt her feelings?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: I'm just saying.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Yeah, I know, you love her.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: What'd you say?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE:  Does any of this look familiar from when you were coming back?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Well, yeah, there's my favorite leaf. How could I forget this place?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK:  What's wrong?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE:  When you came across the island what side was the ocean on?  You came from the east, Michael's heading north.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: It means he's not going back to where you came from. He's heading somewhere else.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SUN: 오늘 햇볕이 너무 따가워요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JIN: 필요 없어. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SUN: 알아요. 그래도 그냥 쓰고 있어요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JIN:  무슨 일이 있나봐. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SUN: Hello, Hurley.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 HURLEY: Hey. Cool hat, dude. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SUN: Is Kate alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 HURLEY: Uh, yeah. I guess Michael took off.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JIN: 뭐라고 하는 거야? 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SUN: What do you mean he took off?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 HURLEY: He stole some guns and he went all commando. He said he was going after Walt. Later dudes, gotta get to the hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SUN: 지금 뭐 하는 거에요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JIN: 금방 떠났다니까 충분히 따라잡을 수 있을거야. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SUN: 당신 아무데도 못 가요.  못 간다니까? 여기서 한 발짝도 움직이지 마! 당신이 뗏목 타고 나갔을 때... 내가 얼마나 걱정했는 줄 알아요? 살아있는지, 죽었는지도 모르고... 정말 미쳐버리는 줄 알았어! 다시는 그러고 싶지 않아요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JIN: 마이클은 내 친구야. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SUN: 나는 당신 아내에요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Hey, Doc, you want to slow down -- take a break a minute?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE:  Good idea.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: He still heading north?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Yep.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Do you think he's lost?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Doesn't seem to be. Trail's as straight as the interstate. The path of a man who knows where he's going.  Where are you going, Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Well, let's say we catch up with him -- Michael. What are you going to do?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I'm going to bring him back.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: What if he doesn't want to come back?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I'll talk him into coming back.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: This is the second time he's gone after Walt. He knocked me out, he locked us both up. Something tells me he might be past listening to reason.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: What? You think we should just let him go -- write him off?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Who are we to tell anyone what they can or can't do?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: It's not too late to go back. The tumor's aggressive, but your father could lead a very normal life for at least another year.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: Go back? Go back where? Home? Have you changed your mind, Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: No.  No.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA:  Is that it? Even if you don't succeed, you're giving us a chance. That's all we wanted.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I'll come out and check on you before I scrub in.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: Am I interrupting?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: No, I was just leaving.  I'll see you in the morning.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I'll see you in the morning. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN:  ITR reports need to be signed by you as Chief Resident.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: Careful. There's a line, son. You know it's there. And pretending it's not -- that would be a mistake.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Guess you would know.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: It may be okay for some people, Jack. But not for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Are you sure Mike went this way?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Why do you ask?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Oh, I don't know, Mr. Clean, I probably would have gone around Mt. Vesuvius.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Why'd you pick that name?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Ain't it obvious? All you need's an earring and a mop.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: No, your name. Why'd you pick Sawyer?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: What do you mean, pick?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: After the census Hurley gave me the flight manifest. Your name is James, right? James Ford.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: What's it to you?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Just an interesting name to choose, is all. Who'd you get it from?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Who says I got it from anybody?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK:  Michael!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE:  Jack, get down.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK:  Michael!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE:  Jack! Jack!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Michael!  Michael!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE:  Jack. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: What?  He's close.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Yeah, and if he was shooting at someone you want them coming back?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Personally, hell, yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: You said these people were two days across the island.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Yeah, and they took Cindy less than a mile from our camp.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Over here. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Shell casings. How many?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: 3, Michael's.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: You boys deaf? I heard at least 7 shot. You heard it, Daniel Boone, what's your count?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Yeah, 7 sounds about right.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: It's getting dark. Which way did Mike go?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: You out here for Michael, or -- is this pay back for getting shot?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: Why are you out here, Doc? You got your reasons and I got mine.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: Jack. Jack!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I had it!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: I know, son.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I got it! I got it all! I mean, I had it!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: He was a sick old man on a table for 7 and half hours. His heart gave out. It's nobody's fault.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I've got to go tell her.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: Yeah, well, I've already done that.  Lest you forget, I am still Chief of Surgery.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Where is she?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: Maybe you should go home.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Where is she?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: She's gone. Jack, go home.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Gabriela, my father told me that you'd gone. I, uh -- I, uh --
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: Thank you. Thank you for trying. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK:  I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 GABRIELA: It's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I, I'm... I can't. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: What do you mean you lost it?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: He's a man, not a boar. The sign's more subtle. I need light to follow it.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK:   Here, light.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: I think we'd better head back.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Just find the trail, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: I've lost the trail.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: You don't just lose a trail! You just don't want to find him.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Yeah, that's right, Jack. I've been running in the jungle toward the sound of gunfire because I don't care about Michael. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Don't turn around on me, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: You're not going to get him to come back and you know it.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: You know what happens if we just turn around and go back? We're never going to see him again. And that's going to be on us -- on you, and on me.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM:  You're exactly right, Jack! But if I were you, I'd listen to Mr. Locke.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Who are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: He's the son-of-a-bitch that shot me on the raft. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: Why don't you point the gun down?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: It'd probably be best if we just keep our hands at our sides, gentlemen.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Where's Michael?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: Don't worry about Michael. He's not going to find us.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: What do you want?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: Why don't you build us a fire, John? I think it's time we all had a talk.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 HURLEY: Geronimo Jackson?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHARLIE: Well, hooo, as an expert in all things musical -- I've never heard of these guys, shocking as that may be. Geronimo Jackson?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 HURLEY:  This looks sweet. Let's give her a rip.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 HURLEY: So what do you think's the story with that Libby chick?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHARLIE: The story?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 HURLEY: She's kind of cute, right? You know, in a I've-been-terrorized-by-the-Others-for-40-days kind of way.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHARLIE: Yeah, there is that.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 HURLEY: I think I have a chance with her. I mean, it's the classic desert island scenario. If I ever had a shot, this is it.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHARLIE: Do you think Claire's missed me yet?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 HURLEY: Dude, it's been a day.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAYID:  This music is quite depressing.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 HURLEY: We can change it, dude. Did you ever hear of Geronimo Jackson?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAYID: I'm afraid not. Where's Jack and Locke?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 HURLEY: Oh, they went after Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAYID: Michael?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CHARLIE: Yeah, he's run after Walt again. Everyone's gone to bring him back.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAYID: Who's everyone?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 HURLEY: Everyone -- Jack, Sawyer, Locke. Oh, and Kate.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: Just sit down, Jack. Nobody's going to hurt you. I come in peace.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: How do you know our names? 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: You took Walt.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: Walt's fine. He's a very special boy.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Look, you said you wanted to talk. Talk.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: Let me ask you something. How long you been here on the island?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: 50 days.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: Oooo, 50 days. That's what -- almost 2 whole months, huh? Tell me, you go over a man's house for the first time, do you take off your shoes? Do you put your feet up on his coffee table? Do you walk in the kitchen, eat food that doesn't belong to you?  Open the door to rooms you got no business opening? You know, somebody a whole lot smarter than anybody here once said: "Since the dawn of our species man's been blessed with curiosity." You know the other one about curiosity don't you, Jack? This is not your island. This is our island. And the only reason you're living on it is because we let you live on it.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK:  I don't believe you.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: You don't believe what?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I think you've got one guy up there with a gun. I think there's more of us than there are of you. I think if you had any real strength, you wouldn't have had to send a spy -- Ethan.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: That's an interesting theory.  Light 'em up!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: We've got a misunderstanding, Jack -- your people, my people. So listen carefully. Right here, there's a line. You cross that line, we go from misunderstanding to something else. Now, give me your weapons, turn around, go home.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Jack, maybe...
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: No!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: I hoped it wouldn't come to this.  Bring her out, Alex!
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: She was following you. Like I said -- curiosity. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: Don't. --  Jack, the decision you gotta make right now is this -- can you live with the fact that I shot this woman right in front of you when you could have saved her life by giving up and going home? Or are you going to give me your guns, turn around and walk away. It's your call, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER: You touch a hair on her head, I'll...
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: Shut up! I'm going to count to 3. 1, 2...
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Stop.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: Now them.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 TOM: Give me the other one, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER:  You and me ain't done, Zeke.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE: Jack, I, uh...
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK:  You alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE: Yep.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SUN: 혼자 여기서 뭐해? 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JIN: 잠이 오지 않아서... 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SUN: 사람들은 돌아 왔어요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JIN: 아직... 자기야. 이래라저래라 하는거 내가 제일 싫어하는 거 알지? 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SUN: 지난 4년 동안, 난 항상 그렇게 살아왔어요. 당신이 싫은 것처럼, 나도 싫어. 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JIN: 그래. 당신도 그랬을 거야.  
Lost.Season02.Episode11 KATE: I was just trying to help, Jack. When you told me not to go, I just... I made a mistake.  Hey, could you just talk to me for a second. -- I'm sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: Hey. How did it go?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: He died.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Yeah, me too. Who was over?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: My mom.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: The bridge game okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: Oh yeah, she's on a streak. Did you eat?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Yeah. No, it's uh, it's late. I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: You don't have to do that.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: It's therapeutic -- cheaper than a shrink.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: How did the daughter take it? What's her name, Gabriela?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: She kissed me. Yeah, she... she kissed me and I kissed her back. I, I don't know. I don't know how it happened. I made a mistake. I made a mistake and this is my fault. It's my fault that you and me... I haven't been here. Sarah, I mean, we don't even talk anymore. I hate what's happening to us and I promise you that things are going to be different. I'm going to, I'm going to work less. I'm going to be here for you. Okay? I'm going to fix this. We're going to go back to the way things were. I'm going to fix this. I'm going to fix this.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: Jack. Jack, I'm leaving you.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: I was already leaving you. That's why my mother was here. She was helping me pack. I've been seeing someone -- someone else. I have to... I can't stay.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Sarah.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SARAH: You, you will always need something to fix. -- Goodbye.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: See ya, James.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 SAWYER:  Don't beat yourself up, Freckles. If he'd told me to stay behind, I'd have done the same damn thing.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE:  What's the matter? What's the matter with your little foot? Hi. Hi.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CLAIRE:  Who's that? 
Lost.Season02.Episode11 LOCKE: Uh-oh, you don't like old Uncle Johnny.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 CLAIRE: What is he doing to your toe?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 ANA:  Hey, go away. I barely have enough food to feed myself.  Here.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: I see you found a new friend.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 ANA: Progress. I hear you were out looking for Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 ANA: He ran off looking for his kid again?  Not much you can do about that then.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Is it true that you killed one of them?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 ANA: One of who?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Them.  Sayid tells me that you're a cop.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 ANA: I was a cop.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: Can I ask you something?
Lost.Season02.Episode11 ANA: Shoot.
Lost.Season02.Episode11 JACK: How long do you think it would take to train an army?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 YOUNG LIAM:  Voltron, whoa!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 YOUNG CHARLIE: Where are my presents?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 MRS. PACE: Right over here, Charlie. 
Lost.Season02.Episode12 YOUNG CHARLIE:  It's a piano! This is mine?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 MRS. PACE: Yes, Charlie. Father Christmas must have known how talented you are.  You're special, love. Someday you're going to get us out of here, all of us. Now, go on, play us a tune.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM:  Come on, baby brother.  You can't save us if you don't play.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 MRS. PACE: Come on, Charlie, play. Play me a tune. Come on now, let's hear it.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 VOICE: He ain't saving no one, he ain't. Music. Music will never get you anywhere, Charlie boy.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 BUTCHER:  You need a trade.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Dad?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: Do it baby bro; save us.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 MRS. PACE: Save us, Charlie. Save us.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Aaron?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Aaron! Aaron! It's okay Aaron, it's alright.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Aaron!! Aaron!!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Sun! Hey, Sun! Have you seen Claire and the baby, they've gone.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SUN: They're right over there.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Is Aaron okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SUN: Yes, he's fine. Charlie!? --
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: It's okay, shhh.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I made Aaron some nappies this morning.  I'll just put those there.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Has he been asking about me?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Charlie -- don't.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I'm sorry. I should have told you about the statue -- what was in it. I just wish things could get back to the way they were before.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: There is no before, Charlie. We were strangers on a plane and we became friends.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Now Locke's your friend, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Please, Charlie, just for now give me some space, okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Yeah, space.  See ya, mate. Take care of your mom now, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KAREN:  Charlie? Hey!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Hey! What are you doing up? You should be lying down.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KAREN: I just needed to see her again. Isn't she brilliant?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: She's beautiful, Karen.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KAREN: I named her Megan. Where's Liam?  He's not here.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Karen, look, it wasn't his fault. We were leaving the club in Dresden -- I was in a cab -- he, he was in a van with the gear and they blew a tire on the way to the airport. He missed his flight. He's on the next plane, alright? He'll be here soon.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KAREN: But he's okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: He's great. He's a dad.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Oh, for the -- Liam. Unbelievable. Liam?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Liam, wake up! Oi, what the hell's wrong with you?  What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: Hey, baby brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: You're supposed to be cleaning up. Get up. I told Karen you missed your flight. She's all alone at the hospital and you're here fixing? What's the matter with you?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: I'm cool. I'm cool. I just needed to get right, that's all.  Don't worry, I left you some.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Get right? Why don't you get up? Take a shower, get dressed, get to the hospital.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: Alright. Alright, I'm on it. Alright.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Oh, by the way -- you have a daughter. Her name's Megan.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM:  After mum?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Yeah, after mum. Now clean yourself up. You're a sodding father now.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KATE: Easy. That's good. That was good. Okay, one more.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: Uh, Sawyer, when you were over there across the Island how well did you get to know those Tailies?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SAWYER: Well enough, why?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: That Libby chick seems pretty cool. I mean, is she?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SAWYER: Well, you got a little love connection brewing over there, Jabba?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: Nah, just asking.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SAWYER: I hear you asking.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY:  Forget it.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KATE:  What's with you? You're acting like you're in junior high.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SAWYER: Well, what do we have here? It looks like Ana Lucia is getting the 20 dollar tour. That's the third time I've seen them walking out of the jungle.  What do you suppose they're doing out there?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KATE: Why don't you just do your exercises, Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Bloody hell.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Hey! Hey! Somebody help me! I ca-- help!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Help! The baby!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Aaron! Aaron! I'm coming! I'm coming, Aaron! Okay. Just hang on.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I've got you. It's alright. It's okay. You're okay now. You're safe. You're safe. It's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Mom? Claire?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 MRS. PACE:  He's in danger. You have to save him. The baby's in danger. You have to save him. The baby's in terrible danger. He's in danger. You have to save him. He's in danger. You have to save him. Danger. You have to save him. He's in danger.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE:  You have to save the baby. Charlie, only you can save him. The baby. You have to save the baby, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: Charlie? What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE:  What?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: What are you doing, man?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: What's going on?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: It's the middle of the night. What are you doing with the baby?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I don't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE:  Help! Somebody took my baby!!  I don't know, Aaron's gone.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: It's okay! We're over here!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE:  Is he alright?! Is he okay?!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Claire. I don't know what happened. I'm sorry. He's okay, though. I, I had this dream --
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: Stick? I don't know, dude. Don't you need 21? I think you should hit.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SAWYER: But I've got a 6; I'm going to bust.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: How do you know that?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SAWYER: Well, I don't, but you've got to assume that I'm going to bust.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: Why?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SAWYER: Well, well, look who's off to the laundromat? Well, go on. I'm sure you've got a load you need to drop in, don't you, Jethro?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: I'm kind of waiting for my moment.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SAWYER:  Well, your moment is now, Hoss. Hey Libby!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIBBY: Hey yourself. 
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Hey, John, can I talk to you for a second?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Yeah, what is it, Charlie?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I take it you heard about what happened last night.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: If you mean you taking the baby out of Claire's tent in the middle of the night -- yeah, I heard.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: This whole thing was a big misunderstanding, John. I was sleepwalking. I don't how or why --
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Is there something you want from me, Charlie?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I was hoping you could speak to Claire for me. You know, put in a good word.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Are you using?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Heroin. Are you using again?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Kate sees a horse -- nothing. Pretty much everybody's seen Walt wandering around the jungle. But when it's Charlie it must be the bloody drugs, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: It's funny, you didn't answer my question.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: You remember the plane, John? We burned it, Eko and me. We burned the whole thing -- the heroin, the statues -- it's all gone. Destroyed.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: All of them?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: All of them.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Trust is a hard thing to win back. Claire needs time. You should leave her and the baby alone for awhile.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Can you do this? You look green.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: Sod off. I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 DIRECTOR: All right, let's give this another go, shall we?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Get it together, alright. Lest you forget, we need this.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 DIRECTOR:  Tea.  So, you lads ready?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Yeah, we're ready.  Let's go.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 DIRECTOR: Let's try not to blow it this time, eh.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Thank you.  You good?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 DIRECTOR: We've only 20 minutes until we're in overtime. Now get it right.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 DIRECTOR: Alright. Camera. Rotate on the 8 count.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CREW: Rolling.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 DIRECTOR: Hold the product up!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CREW: Bubbies diapers, take 53.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CREW: Playback.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 DIRECTOR: And, action.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 DIRECTOR: Cut!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: It's alright.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 DIRECTOR: That's it. We wrap.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Oi, no! Oi, mate, hang on. Wait, what are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 DIRECTOR: Let's not waste anymore time, shall we? You were only hired as a favor to your lawyer. I wanted Dirt Spigot.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Come on, mate. Give us another chance.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 DIRECTOR: You want another chance? Take my advice; ditch that one . He's a bloody disaster.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I'm not ditching anyone. He's my brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 DIRECTOR: Right. Well then, I guess you're fired.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIBBY: Is this washer and dryer newer than everything else in here?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: It washes clothes. That's all I need to know.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIBBY: Ah, finally, someone who keeps it simple. Oh, hey, look at this.  I got it in some of the abandoned luggage. You think I can pull this off?  Let me give you a hand -- when a girl asks that kind of question, she's looking for validation.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY:  Do I know you from somewhere?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIBBY: You mean other than the flight?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: Flight?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIBBY: Okay, turn around.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: Huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIBBY: Turn around. I want to try it on. Turn around.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: Oh, oh, sure, go ahead.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIBBY: No peeking.  I cannot believe you don't remember stepping on my foot.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: I did?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIBBY: Yes, you did. And it was hard. I know that because I remember you were the last one on the flight, and you were all sweaty, and you had headphones on -- and crunch. You stepped on my foot. Okay, turn around. What do you think?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 HURLEY: It's awesome.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIBBY: Thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: I'm marking trees.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Why?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: Because these are the ones I like.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Did you tell Locke you gave me one of those statues from the plane?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: Why would I do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: He knows, man. Bald wanker knows something.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: Something wrong, Charlie?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Apart from me losing my mind? No, everything's just peachy.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: Why would you say you are losing your mind?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: How about the fact that I've been sleepwalking? Stealing babies from their cribs? Oh yeah, and then there's the vivid dreams that make me feel like I'm completely awake until, of course, I wake up.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: What are your dreams about?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Variations on Aaron being in mortal peril -- trapped in a piano, drifting out to sea, there's the flying dove, and Claire and my mum dressed as angels telling me I need to save the baby.  What?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: Have you ever considered that these dreams mean something?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Like what?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: What if you do need to save the baby?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I have to talk to her.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KATE: Hey, you know, now's not a good time. Okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: No, I have to talk to her. She'll want to hear this.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KATE:  Okay, you know what, so tell me and I will tell her.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Kate! No. Claire!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KATE: I said not now!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Claire! Wait, please, Claire! Listen to me. Aaron's in danger.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: The baby's in danger! Look, I've been having these dreams. I know what they mean now.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KATE: Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Kate! Claire, listen, we have to baptize Aaron.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: We can do this! Eko's a priest! We can do this!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KATE:  It's time to go.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: No, wait! I'm not finished! Claire, look, we have to baptize Aaron!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 KATE:  I said it's time to go. Now!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 JACK:  Here. For when it rains.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 ANA: Thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 ANA: So when are you going to tell me what happened in the jungle?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 JACK: I already did. Pull it tighter; it'll sag.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 ANA: You told me what that guy said. You didn't tell me what made you turn around -- what made you come back.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 JACK: He had a gun at Kate's head.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 ANA: You hittin' that?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 ANA: Plane crash -- you both survive -- nice beach -- she's hot, you're hot. It's what people do.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 JACK: I'm not hittin' that.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: Karen kicked me out, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: What? What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: She, uh, she thinks I'm dangerous.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Why would she think that?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: Because I dropped her.  I dropped Megan.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Oh. Hey, Liam, sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: I've got no money. I've got nothing. What are we going to do?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: We'll get through this.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: Yeah, how's that?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I'm writing again. I've got a new song. It's about 2 brothers.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: 2 brothers who should be butchers.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Don't say that! It's a good one. I feel like this might be the one. Alright, listen to this, okay.  Funny now, you finally see me standing here/Funny now, I'm crying in the rain.  All alone, I try to be invincible/Together now , we can be saved.  Nice, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: This could work.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: It's good, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: We could make it work. Write all night just like the old days.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Alright.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: So, baby brother, have you got any?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE : I'm disappointed in you, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: You followed me?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: How long have you been coming out here?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: John, you've got the wrong idea, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: You said you destroyed them all, and yet here they are. How is that the wrong idea?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I came out here to finish the job. I'm going to get rid of these right now.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Yeah, that's very convenient now that I found you. 
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE : There was a time when I let you choose whether or not you were going to do this to yourself. Now I'm making that choice for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Oh, you don't believe me? Give them to me. Give them to me right now; I'll destroy them! Look!  I'll throw them in the sodding wind. Look, John, I know I lied, alright.  Just wait, wait, wait! Remember all those talks we had, you and me? You said everything happens for a reason -- this island tests us. That's what this is, John, a test. This is my test. That's why these are here.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: These are here because you put them here, Charlie. 
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Wait, John, wait.  What are you going to do? Are you going to tell Claire? You can't. If she sees them, I'm done. She'll never trust me again, and she has to, John. It's about the baby, alright? Aaron's in danger. You have to believe me.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: You've given up the right to be believed, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Hi. How's our boy?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Oh, he's good. Hey, John, can I ask you something?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Do you think Aaron and I could stay in the bedroom in the Hatch for a while?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: A pretty loud alarm goes off every hour and a half. It's not the best place for a baby to sleep through the night.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Oh, yeah, sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: How about if I move my stuff down here for a couple of nights -- set up right next to your tent?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: That would be great, thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Consider it done.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Hey, John, you don't know anything about baptism, do you?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Not a whole lot, why?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Charlie came by my tent before and told me Aaron had to be baptized -- he was in danger.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: My understanding is that baptism is about making sure that children get into heaven -- should anything happen. Call it spiritual insurance. There isn't any danger, Claire. Charlie is just  -- Charlie just feels like he has to save the baby because he can't save himself. I'll see you tonight.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SAYID: Charlie, can you give us a hand?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Now's not a good time, Sayid.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SAYID:  Here, let's lift this.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SAYID: Fire! Fire!  Grab tools, containers for sand, anything you have. If we don't stop it now, it's going to burn right through the camp.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE:  Stay here with Aaron.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 SAYID: We need to cut a fire break right here! Form a bucket line!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Some of you people down to the water!  We'll hand them up, wait here.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Liam! My piano. What's going on? Liam, where's my piano?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: I sold it.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: You what?  Hey, wait, I don't have to --
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: Get off me.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Where's the money?! Is it up your sodding arm?!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: I'm clean. I haven't used in two days.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Two days? Well, happy anniversary!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: Well, how long have you been clean?!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Where's the money?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: She was going to leave me, Charlie. She was going to take Megan.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: What did you do, Liam?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: Karen's got an uncle in Australia. He's going to get me a job. There's a rehab clinic in Sydney. I just needed the money to get us there. I have to do this. I have to take care of myself for them -- for my family.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I'm your family!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Wait. Will you just wait?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: I can't, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: What about the band? What about the song?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LIAM: Try to understand. I have to go. I have to. Look, I'll give you a call when things settle down for me. 
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: For you? What about me? What about my family? What about my family?!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Charlie, what are you doing?!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I'm doing what I have to do.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: He's got my baby!! Stop it!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: No, Claire, it's alright! It's not --
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Charlie, stop! Help! Somebody help! He's got my baby!!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Help! Come on, Charlie, please. Stop it.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I just wanted to save him!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Charlie! Give me the baby.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Eko, tell them! Tell them, Eko! Tell them what you told me -- that the baby has to be baptized!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: This is not the way.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Charlie, come on, give him to me.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: Who the hell are you, John?! Aaron's not your responsibility! Where were you when he was born?! Where were you when he was taken?! You're not his father! You're not his family!
Lost.Season02.Episode12 LOCKE: Neither are you, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I have to do this. I need to. I'm not going to hurt him.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: You're hurting me, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Claire. I'm sorry, Claire.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 JACK: You need stitches.  Try to be still.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I started the fire, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 JACK: Yeah, I know.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I was desperate. She --
Lost.Season02.Episode12 JACK: I need to know you're never going to do anything like this again. Ever.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: I know what this looks like -- what people think. It doesn't matter now, but I didn't use. I wanted to. I really wanted to. But I didn't.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 JACK: That's not what I asked, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CHARLIE: It's not going to happen again.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: Charlie told me you were a priest.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: He said that you told him that I had to have --
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: I did not tell Charlie to do what he did. I'm sorry if he misunderstood me.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: But, do you think the baby has to be baptized?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: Do you know what baptism is?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: It's what gets you into heaven.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: It is said that when John the Baptist baptized Jesus the skies opened up and a dove flew down from the sky. This told John something -- that he had cleansed this man of all his sins. That he had freed him. Heaven came much later.
Lost.Season02.Episode12 CLAIRE: I haven't been baptized. Does that mean that if you do it to Aaron and something happened to us that we wouldn't be together?
Lost.Season02.Episode12 EKO: Not if I baptize you both.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: Is that all of them?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: All 6 of them. And there's uh, 1 box of ammo.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: At least we don't have to worry about running out any time soon. Jack, I'm grateful that you decided to keep them all in the same place.  Oh, I had to take them from Charlie -- his heroin stash. I figure it might have therapeutic value, if it ever came to that.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: You're just going to leave it all in the statues?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: You want to break 7 Virgin Maries, be my guest. I'm superstitious.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: John, the combination.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: I'm going to go ahead and assume that you're asking me because you're worried that I might fall off a cliff or something, that it would be irresponsible for just one of us to have access to this room, rather than this being an issue of trust.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Well, there are a lot of cliffs on this island, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: Alright, but I think we should agree, Jack, that if either of us need to open this door, we consult each other first.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Absolutely.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: Right 7, left 33, right 18. You need to write it down?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Nope, I got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: Alright. And, Jack, you may want to consider locking the medicine in here, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Why would I need to do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Well, well, now look who had to relocate to the suburbs.  Ain't that just like a woman? She keeps the house and you get the cheap-ass apartment. Man, I thought these people hated me, but I've got to hand it to you -- stealing a baby, trying to drown it -- now, that's a new low. You even made Locke take a swing at you. Hell, that's like getting Gandhi to beat his kids.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CHARLIE: Shouldn't you be more worried about Jack ransacking your tent right now?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: What the hell do you think you're doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK:  You stole these from the Hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: You stole them from me.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: They were in my stash when I left. I just took back what was mine.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: These belong to all of us, Sawyer -- to the group. You don't have a stash anymore.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Seriously, Doc, you don't want to do this. Just give me the pills. We'll forget it ever happened.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Are you threatening me?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Last chance, Doc. 
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: What do you want -- right now?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Just you.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER:  Oh, damn it!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: What is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: I'm going to be late to that meeting I told you about.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Meeting, huh? You got another date you could just say so.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: I can only wrap my mind around one woman at a time -- but I appreciate the permission. Back in flash, gorgeous.  You weren't exactly supposed to see that.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Are you serious?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: You're not serious. You just happen to have a suitcase full of cash? And you go to pick it up and the lock just happens to break?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Give me that.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: It's not even real. Newspaper? Are you trying to con me? What, I ask you what all the money's for and you do some song and dance about an investment or something? And then I say, "Oh, hey, I've got some money."
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Look, you got me. Good for you. No harm, no foul.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: You should have done your homework. I didn't take anything from him in the divorce. I'm not even worth your trouble.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Well, shame on me.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: I want you to show me what you do. Show me what you do -- what you really do.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: And what do I do?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Show me how to con people, Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: I like what you've done with the place.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Maid's day off.  You want to move?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: I heard Jack took your pain killers.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Well, I guess me and the Doc are on the outs. One less Christmas card I'll have to send this year.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE:  Maybe that'll cheer you up. It's from the Hatch. I know you're hard up for new reading material.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Well, as much as I'd like to learn to feather my hair , I lost my damn glasses on the raft. You want to read it to me?  What, you got an appointment or something?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE:  Alright, "10 Ways To Tell If He's A Sensitive Man".
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: This ought to be good.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE:  Morning.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Hey, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER:  Now, there's a sensitive man.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Claire asked him to sleep down here.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Come on. Locke's got himself needs -- just like anyone else.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Not everyone is like you, Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: I guess that's why El Jacko and Ana-Lulu didn't ask me to join their revolution.  What, you didn't hear about their little army? I guess I'm not the only one on the outs with the Doc.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Hey, man. You gonna put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both up?  Lime in the coconut? The song?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAYID: What do you want, Hurley?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: So, I'm over at Rose and Bernard's tent. Did you know he's a dentist? Well, that's not all he's been holding out on us. The guy picked up Boone's signal from the Norwegian plane.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAYID: Nigerian.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Right. Anyhow, he picked it up with this. 
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAYID: That is a short wave radio. It's a glorified walkie-talkie.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Yeah, but can't you switch a blue wire with a red wire -- make it stronger.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAYID: We tried to send a signal with the plane's transceiver and all we got was the French woman's message on a loop. Why would I bother?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Come on, man, I mean, it's worth...
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAYID: It's worth nothing. It's a waste of time.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Just trying to cheer you up, dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAYID: I don't need cheering up.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Okay, man. Sorry. No problem.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANA: Hey.  Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANA: You get the combo?  Nice. I didn't think it would be that easy convincing your pal to give it up. That's the nice thing about you people -- you're not scared enough.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Not scared enough?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANA: Same reason we can't talk anyone into joining the army. Everyone around here actually thinks they're safe.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Trust me, Ana. No one thinks we're safe.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANA: So, Jack, what's the combo?  I was just kidding.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SUN:  Oh, Vincent! What are you doing out here? 거기 조심해, 밟으면 안 돼.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Oh, man. It's really coming down. Get under here, Freckles.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: I like the rain.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER:  Yeah, me too, if I'm under here.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: That's Sun.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Is she alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: She's breathing.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Go get Jack. -- Go get Jack!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Where's Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Was she conscious at all? Did she say anything?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Nothing. Not a word.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JIN:  자기야, 자기야!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: She's okay. She's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JIN: 어떻게 된거야?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: She's going to be alright. You need to let me take care of her, alright, please.  Where'd you find her?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: I heard her scream. Found her out in the jungle about a half a click from here.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: She was out cold and her hands were tied.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: What do you mean, her hands were tied?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANA: They're back.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: They told us they would leave us alone.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Well, John, it looks like they broke their promise.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: We don't even know what happened.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Do we need to know?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANA: Where'd you find her?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Just outside her garden.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANA: We should take a look around -- with guns.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: No?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: If we arm up we're just as likely to shoot each other as we are one of them.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Okay, we'll wait for Sun to wake up. She'll tell us what happened. Then we're going to do something about it.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: Sounds like a plan.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: They usually don't leave any trail.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: It's worth a look. Let me ask you something. This whole scenario make sense to you?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: What do you mean?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Think about it. First off, how'd she get away? The woman doesn't weigh 100 pounds soaking wet.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: She was fighting for her life. People are capable of almost anything...
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: You couldn't get away. You versus Sun -- hot oil death match -- my money's on you, Sheena.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Thanks for your vote of confidence.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: It's a hood, just like the one they put over my head.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: No it's not. This one's black, different weave. It's all in the details -- and they're wrong.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Well, if it wasn't them, then who?  What are you saying, one of us did it? Who the hell would want to go after Sun?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Not much upside to scaring the crap out of 46 people -- unless you're trying to con them into joining an army.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Those necklaces are junk, Sawyer. A 5 year old could tell that.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: They ain't going to be looking at the necklaces. They're going to be looking at the price tags. It's all in the details, Dimples.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: What if we get caught?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: We ain't going to get caught.  Anybody goes to the cops, the only thing they're going to remember is a guy that looks like he's been in a bar fight. -- You're scared, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: A little bit.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Well, here's the good news, baby -- everybody's scared. The thing they're scared of most is missing an opportunity.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Hey, you guys want to buy some necklaces?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GUY: Where'd you get them?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Where do you think? You want to buy them, or not?  Oh, forget it. 
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY : Hey, how much?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: 100 a piece.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: For any of them?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Yeah, yeah, taster's choice.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: I'll take the 1200 dollar one and the 1300 dollar one. Thanks. 
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GUY: Hey, wait.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GUY #2: Hang on, man. I'll buy some of those.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GUY: Yeah, me too. It's Gina's birthday next week.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GUY #2: They love their jewelry.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK:  The pulse is good. Strong. We just need to watch her. She's going to be okay, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: That bump on her head -- do you think she fell or that someone hit her?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Jack, how well do you know Ana Lucia?  It's just -- the Others, I -- I was out there with you. I heard that man say that if we stayed away they'd leave us alone. And we've left them alone. So why would they attack us a few days later?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Well, if it wasn't them then who was it?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Like I said, how well do you know Ana Lucia?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANA: I got a couple more people interested in joining up.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Yeah, who?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANA: Uh, the big guy who lives behind Sayid and Scott.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: You mean Steve, Scott's dead.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANA: Scott, Steve -- the point is, after what happened people are finally willing to do something.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Where were you this morning?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANA: Lots of places.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: During the rain storm.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 ANA: You think I had something to do with Sun getting grabbed? Now, where would you get an idea like that?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CLAIRE:  Jack! Jack, Sun's awake.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Hey. How's your head? Any pain, dizziness?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SUN: Just a little bit.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Do you remember anything?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SUN: I was working in my garden when Vincent ran up. Then it started raining and there was a bag over my head and I was being dragged.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: How many were there?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SUN: I don't... I didn't see anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JIN: 지금 뭐라고 한 거야? 나한테도 말해봐!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SUN: 당신한테 말한 것 그대로에요. I kicked and I fought, and I just ran as fast as I could and then I fell...
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JIN:  이렇게 당하고만 있을 수는 없어! 저 놈들을 잡아야 돼!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SUN: 여보, 제발...
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JIN: 아니야!  Gun. Gun! -- Gun.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Hey, what's going on?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: It looks like the good folks of Island Town are about to form a posse -- get themselves armed up. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Jack didn't find that horse of yours and start leading the charge in a big white hat.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: The guns. This is all her play to get her hands on the guns. Locke -- you need to go and tell him that they're coming.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: I need to tell him? 
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Sawyer, please.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: So what's next?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Next?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Next play.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: I'll show you the pigeon drop.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: We already did that - twice. And the Tulsa Bag Scam and the Lookie-Loo. I want to do a big one.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: You want to do a big what?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: A big con.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: It's called a long con.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Okay, a long con. How does it work?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: It works by getting someone to ask you to do something like it's their idea, but it's not their idea, it's your idea. But none of that matters because the one thing you need for the long con we ain't got -- money.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: I have money.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Sorry, Cassidy, 40 grand in some mutual fund ain't money.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Remember what I told you, that I didn't get anything from the divorce?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Mmmhmm.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: I kind of lied.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Kind of lied how much?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: 600 grand.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Well, hell baby, with that kind of money let's go find an island somewhere and sit on a beach drinking Mojitos 'til we go toes up.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Sawyer, for the first time in my life I'm actually happy. And it's not really about the action and the money. It's about doing this with you. Come on, one long con? And then the mojitos.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: I'll think about it.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY:  Why don't you think about it in here?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Hate to interrupt whatever the hell it is you're doing. What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: I'm alphabetizing.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Oh, sure. Sun gets attacked in the jungle and you figure it's a good time to start the damn Dewey decimal system. Good thinking.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: How can I help you, James?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Well, actually, John, I'm here to help you -- give you the heads-up.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: Heads-up?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Seems Jack's on his way over here to open your little gun closet and take whatever he needs. You should know he's not alone. The whole camp's pretty shook up about what happened to Tokyo Rose. I'm guessing everybody's going to want to play Cowboys and Indians. And once those guns are out and about -- something tells me they ain't never going back in.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: Why are you telling me this?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Because it'll piss off Jack. If I were you, I'd change that combination, pronto.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: But that won't work. The door will just slow him down. If Jack wants to get in, he'll get in. Will you help me?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Help you what?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: Move the guns.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Move them where?  Fine, you don't want to trust me -- lots of luck.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: But I can't leave the Hatch unmanned.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Sure, you move the guns and I'll stay here and push your damn button for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: How long 'til they get here?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Well, that ain't my problem, Hoss. It's yours.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 DIANE: Steak sandwich, two beers.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GORDY:  Aw, shucks, you got a beer for me?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: You want one? Ask the lady.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GORDY:  Well, hell, I do want one. And could I get a plate of chicken salad -- white meat only -- and please, god, no celery, okay, sweetheart?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 DIANE: That's how we make it here, darlin'.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GORDY: So, tell me you got her.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Yeah, I got her.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GORDY: All 600 grand?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER:  All 6.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GORDY: You fell for her. Oh, come on, you've got to be kidding me.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Look, it's got nothing to...
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GORDY: Hey, I found that bitch.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Her name is Cassidy.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GORDY: Well, I waited 6 months while you and Cassidy played house. Now, if you think--
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: I ain't doing it.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GORDY: You know what's making you stupid right now? It's your damn hormones. You think you're in love, but you're not. You know, a tiger doesn't change his stripes, James. You're a con man, just like me. And it's not what you do, it's what you are. Do I make myself clear?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: I'm sorry, man. I just can't do it.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GORDY: No, you're going to do it -- because that girl, she doesn't know you one bit. But when she finds out who you are -- who you really are -- she's going to hate your guts.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Yeah, well -- enjoy your chicken salad, Gordy.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 GORDY: Wait a minute, you don't walk away now. You owe me. You don't want to pay me? I'll put one in your ear, James. You and your little friend, Cassidy.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: One second, I'm like this close to the high score on Donkey Kong.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JIN: 뭘 기다려? 총을 빨리 꺼내자.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER:  Now, what can I do you for?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Where is Locke?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: I don't know. I think he said something about going to the store for a pack of smokes.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Uh-oh, it looks like we've got ourselves a break-in. Who's going to call the cops?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Where are they?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Don't look at me. I was just pushing a button.  Oh yeah, I believe these are yours.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JIN: No. 소이어는 신경 쓰지 마, 응? 그만 해.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: John, where are they? You moved the guns. Where are they? We had an agreement!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: An agreement that you were about to violate, Jack.  Yes, I moved the guns.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: Where? Where? Where, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: Oh, are you going to start handing them out? How many? Who gets them? How much time before there's an accident? Another accident. I made a mistake teaching Michael how to shoot and now he's... He could be dead for all I know -- and that, that was my fault. I take responsibility for that and so, yes, I'm taking responsibility for the guns, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: I want 2 guns, John!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE: I'm sorry, Jack! That's the way it's going to be, Jack!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK: 2 guns! Now tell me where they are, right now!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 JACK:  You gave him the guns?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 LOCKE:  No. I hid them.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: That's right, Jack. He's as stupid as you are. You were so busy worrying about each other you never even saw me coming, did you? How about you listen up because I'm only going to say this once. You took my stuff. While I was off trying to get us help -- get us rescued -- you found my stash and you took it, divvied it up -- my shaving cream, my batteries, even my beer. And then something else happened, you decided these two boys here were going to tell you what to do and when to do it. Well, I'm done taking orders. And I don't want my stuff back. The shaving cream don't matter. Batteries don't matter. The only thing that matters now are guns. And if you want one you're going to have to come to me to get it!  Oh, you want to torture me, don't you? Show everybody how civilized you are. Go ahead, but I'll die before I give them back. And then you'll really be screwed, won't you? New sheriff in town, boys! You all best get used to it.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: What's going on? Where were you?  Sawyer what happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER:  You see that black car?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Who is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: His name's Gordy, my partner.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: What partner?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: If I don't walk out the front door with that briefcase in the next 2 minutes we're both dead.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: What happened? That's the guy from the Mercado deal? What...?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: There is no Mercado deal! I knew about the 600 grand you had tucked away from the get go. Cass -- you were the long con.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY:  Son of a bitch. Go to hell. Go to hell.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: You've got to understand! Everything that's happened between us in the past 6 months, all of it -- that was real.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Get out! You get out!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Listen. You can hate me all you want later, but right now you've got to listen to me. He's going to kill us -- because I told him I wasn't going to take your money.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Oh my god.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Look, this is him.  Okay, this is what we're going to do. I want you to go out back through Evan's yard. There's a rental car parked out front. Go to Sioux City. I want you to check in at the Sage Flower Motel, off highway 29.  Watch TV, have a drink, and wait for me. I'll be there in the a.m.. It'll all be over.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: Let me just pack a few things.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: There's no time. Remember when you said I was all you ever wanted? Well, now you know better. I love you.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CASSIDY: I love you, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Go. Go.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: How'd you do it?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: How'd I do what?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Locke said that he left you in the Hatch when he went to hide the guns, and we both know you can't track worth a damn. So, how'd you get them?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: A magician never tells his secrets.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: You played us. You played me. All that stuff you said about Ana Lucia -- you knew I'd go to Jack. And you knew I'd ask you to go to Locke.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Now, how in the world would I know all that?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Did you have anything to do with Sun?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: What kind of person do you think I am?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: What kind of a person do I think you are? I don't think this has anything to do with guns, or with getting your stash back! I think you want people to hate you!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Good thing you don't hate me, Freckles.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 KATE: Why do you have to do this?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: You run. I con. Tiger don't change their stripes.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Hey, check this out. I found a manuscript in one of the suitcases. It's like a mystery book.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAYID: I want to show you something.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Cool, you fixed it!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAYID: We'll see.  Hold on to this. Don't expect anything. The chances of getting a signal are slim at best.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Static's good, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAYID: No, reception is good.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Wait, what's that?!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAYID: It's Rousseau's signal.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Oh, crap.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAYID:  But this radio has a wider bandwidth.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Hold it, stop! Do you hear that?!
Lost.Season02.Episode13 RADIO ANNOUNCER:  That was the old classic "Just A-Sittin' and A-Rockin'" by Duke Ellington and his Orchestra, featuring Cootie Williams on the trumpet. Up next on WXR, the Glenn Miller Orchestra with "Moonlight Serenade".
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Whoa, you hear how clear that is? It's got to be close, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAYID: Radio waves at this frequency bounce off the ionosphere. They can travel thousands of miles. It could be coming from anywhere.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 HURLEY: Or, anytime. -- Just kidding, dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: He never saw you, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CHARLIE: No, he was more worried about his sodding guns than being followed.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER:  Figured you'd want your friends back.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CHARLIE: If I wanted them I would have taken them before I told you where they were. That's not why I did it.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: It's not, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CHARLIE: I wanted him to look like a fool -- to feel like a fool.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Well, well, it looks like Johnny Locke's got himself a nemesis.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CHARLIE: Sun can never find out what I did to her. Never.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Don't sweat it. They got bigger things to worry about now.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 CHARLIE: Sawyer, this idea -- all of this -- what we did -- what made you... How does someone think of something like that?
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: Now go.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: 1-Mississippi, 2-Mississippi, 3-Mississippi, 4-Mississippi, 5-Mississippi.
Lost.Season02.Episode13 SAWYER: I'm not a good person, Charlie. Never did a good thing in my life.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 TARIQ:  They're getting closer! Move it! Burn those! Shred faster! Hurry up! Sayid! Take these files! Burn them! Keep shredding you cowards! We leave when I say!  Stop again, and I'll kill you myself! I'm your commanding officer and you will do --
Lost.Season02.Episode14 U.S. SOLDIER #1: Get down! Get the hell down!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. BUCCELLI: Get down. Get down. You, no, no, no, drop your gun. On the ground now.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 U.S. SOLDIER #2: Freeze! On the ground, now!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 U.S. SOLDIER #1: Get the hell down!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. BUCCELLI: Who's in charge here? I said, who's in charge?!  Somebody better tell him to stop, or god help me, he's dead.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 U.S. SOLDIER #1: They don't understand, Sergeant.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. BUCCELLI: They understand. Listen up, I'll fire on 3. 1-2...
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: 
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. BUCCELLI:  You -- you in charge?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: No, I am not.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. BUCCELLI: Who is?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID:  There is no commanding officer here. He left two hours ago for, for Hillah.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. BUCCELLI: Your English is good, Abdul, but you're lying. And that ain't so good.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. BUCCELLI: That's him, Sergeant.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. AUSTEN:  Let's go, hombre.  Son, we don't want to be here any more than you do -- your pal, Saddam, had to go marching into Kuwait -- here we all are. Buccelli here says that you speak English. Ever do any translating?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Formally, no.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. AUSTEN: Hell, the fact you know what "formally" means -- we're good. Apache helicopter went down in this sector 2 days ago. Our sources tell us the pilot was captured. It's very important that we get this pilot back. We know that he was taken to the local Republican Guard intelligence commander -- a man named Tariq. Do you know him?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Yes, he was our commanding officer.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. AUSTEN: Do you know where he is?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: When the bombing started he fled to Hillah.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. AUSTEN: Hillah, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Yes, that is right.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. AUSTEN: Welcome to Hillah.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 ANA: Where's Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Why?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 ANA: There. See?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Go back, I'll deal with this.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 ANA: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Go back, Ana Lucia. And don't tell anyone what you saw.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: What are you doing here, Danielle?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: Looking for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Where are we going? You said you were looking for me. What was your plan? To hide in the woods hoping I would pass you by?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: I was going to wait until dark, then find you at your tent.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Why? 
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: We need to keep moving.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Not until you tell me where we're moving to.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: Trust me.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: The last time we met you arrived to warn us the Others were coming which they weren't. In fact, it was a diversion to kidnap Claire's baby. So pardon me for not trusting you.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: This place I'm taking you to -- there's something that will help you -- something important. As for trust, take this.  If I'm lying it's yours to use.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID:  How much further?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: Not far.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. AUSTEN: Ask him where he took the pilot.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: 
Lost.Season02.Episode14 TARIQ: 
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: He says he does not know.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. AUSTEN: Look, we know for a fact he interrogated the pilot day before yesterday. Hell, probably in this room. Tell him if we get our man back safe and sound, he goes free.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: 
Lost.Season02.Episode14 TARIQ: 
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. AUSTEN: What's he saying?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: He says he does not know.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. AUSTEN: I was born, but I wasn't born yesterday, son. Now, if you don't help me out here, someone else will take over. And that someone -- he won't play nice at all.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: I am sorry. He does not know.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. AUSTEN:  Okay, you had your chance. Guards, lock him back up.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: This is unbelievable.  Hey! Hey, you hear that thing? You hear that frog -- that frog? You want to help me find it?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: What, we ain't friends anymore?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: What do you got there, Rerun?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: Nothing. 
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: Yeah, well, you've got a spot of nothing on your chin there.  "DHARMA Initiative ranch dressing"? You know you're supposed to refrigerate that after you open it?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: Well, actually in the back it says it'll keep at room temperature for up to 7 years.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER:  Well, well, look at who's got a secret stash?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: Please, dude, you can't tell.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: What, that you stole food from the group? Now, why would I want to do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: Come on, man, please?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER:  Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: Dude, it's just a tree frog.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: Have you seen it?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: Tell you what -- you help me find that thing, you can keep right on ranch dipping. We got a deal?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: How much further?  Danielle?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: We're here.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: And where exactly is here?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: What is that for, Danielle?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 VOICE: Help me! Hey, somebody here!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: Wait.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 VOICE: Help!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: Sayid, listen to me.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 VOICE: Hey! Hey, over here! Please, help me.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 VOICE: Help me!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: Don't believe a word he says.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 VOICE: Hey!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: He's one of them.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 VOICE: I have no idea what she's talking about. She's crazy.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: How long has he been up there?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 VOICE: Since last night. Please, just cut me down. My name is Henry Gale. I'm from Minnesota. Please.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: He's lying.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID:  I'm going to cut him down.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: Don't.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: You're making a serious mistake.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID:  It's okay, it's okay. You're alright. You're alright. Hold on. Take it easy.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE:  No.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Wait. Danielle, don't!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: You could have killed him.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: If I wanted to kill him, I would have killed him.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: You shot this man with no provocation.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: He is one of them. Tie him up. You should take him to your doctor. He's no good to you dead.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID:  And then what?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 DANIELLE: You talk to him, Sayid. As I recall that is what you do. But know this -- he will lie -- a long time. He will lie.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 INMAN: I want to talk to you about your buddy -- Tariq. Uh, look, I get it. You're a man who values loyalty. Even doing a little translating for us -- you feel like you're doing the wrong thing. I get that, and I respect it. This is what Tariq was doing before he took over command of your intelligence unit. He was the head of the chemical warfare battalion in the North.  He personally supervised the use of sarin gas on this village. You recognize it, don't you? You had relatives in that village didn't you, Sayid? So, you know what sarin gas does. No discrimination -- the entire marketplace -- innocent women, children.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Enough -- please.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 INMAN:  Loyalty is a virtue. But unquestioning loyalty -- I don't think that's you.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Why should I believe you?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 INMAN: How do you think we knew you had relatives in that village? We liberated your personnel file, and Tariq's.  All we want is our pilot back, so we can send him home to his family.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Tariq will never talk to you.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 INMAN: That's why you're going to have to make him talk to you.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: John, John wake up.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Come out here.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Minnesota, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: That's the question, isn't it?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: Where am I?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Who are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: Henry, Henry Gale. Ah, my back.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: We're going to take it out, but first I want you to relax. How did you get to this island?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: 4 months ago, we crashed, my wife and I.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Crashed in what?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: A balloon. We were trying to cross the Pacific.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Your wife, where is she?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: She died. She got -- she got sick 3 weeks ago. We were staying in a cave off the beach. Ah, my shoulder. At least untie my arms.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK:  What the hell's going here?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Rousseau trapped him in the jungle. She believes he's an Other.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: An other what?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: You shot him with an arrow?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Do I have a bow?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK:  Hey, hey, you with me?  What, you were just going to let him bleed to death?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: I was trying to get honest answers while he was able to give them. And his wound is far from life threatening.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: We should let Jack treat him first, then we'll get our answers.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Jack, do not untie him.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: This is how people get killed in scary movies.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: If this was a scary movie I'd be with a hot chick not you, Barbar.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: It's Babar.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: How about you shut up, Hammo? Or your ranch disorder's going to be the new lead item on the coconut internet.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: Fine, go ahead. Tell everyone the fat guy's been hiding ranch dressing -- the fat guy likes to eat. Yeah, I'm fat. Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat. You think I don't know that? At least people like me. You know what? Find the damn frog by yourself.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: Hurley, wait, wait. Hey, Hurley! -- Look, man, I'm sorry, alright. This frog is killing me. You've got to help me out -- please.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: So, what do you think?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: What do you think, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: I think he's pretty convincing.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Yes, he is.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: The real problem is there's no way we can be sure he's telling the truth.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: That is not necessarily true. Does Jack have the combination to the armory?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: For now he does.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: How long would it take for you to change it?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: If you're angry -- looking for someone to punish...
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Why would I need to punish anyone? I want to find out who he is. I want the truth. And I think we both know that Jack will have issues with what must be done in order to get it. So how long, John, to change the combination?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Couple minutes, tops.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Then I suggest you get started.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Did he say anything while--
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: No, he didn't. He was in shock.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: We can't just leave him laying here, Jack. If people see him it'll create a panic.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Yeah, well, where do you think we should put him?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: I say we put him in the armory, secure.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Better to err on the side of safety, Jack. At least until we can be sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK:  Okay. For now.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: We can pull that cot in here. He shouldn't be on his back.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Good idea.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK:  Sayid, hey, what the hell are you doing?! Sayid! Sayid!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: What needs to be done.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 TARIQ: 
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID:  
Lost.Season02.Episode14 TARIQ:  
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: 
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: The pilot was executed 2 days ago. He's buried in a field 4 kilometers from here. I can take you there.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Damn it. Sayid, open the door! Sayid, answer me!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Why isn't this combination working, John? Did you change it?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Why would you do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: You were raising an army.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: And why you didn't ask me to help -- well, that's your business -- but there's only one reason to raise an army, Jack. And that's because we're at war. And like it or not, whatever Sayid has to do behind that door -- that's a part of it, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: What if he's telling the truth, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: What if he's not?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Get up.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: What is happening?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID:  Here, let me help you. You said you've been here for 4 months.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: You said you came to this island 4 months ago, yes?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: Where am I?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Please, answer my question.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: Yeah, yes we landed 4 months ago. Maybe more. Who are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: And you were in a cave for all that time?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: Off the beach on the North shore of the Island.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: How far from this beach to where you were captured?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: I don't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: How many days' walk?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: 2 -- 2 days.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Why did you stay on the beach for so long?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: Why wouldn't we? We wanted to be there for fly-overs. We had an emergency beacon, a transmitter.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: What kind of transmitter?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: An ADF beacon. We wanted to make sure we'd be spotted. Look, whatever you think I am, I'm not. Please, please just -- tell me your name.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Your wife, what is her maiden name?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: Murphy.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Where did you meet her?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: University of Minnesota.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: How did she die?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: She got sick.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: She got sick?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: It started as a fever. After 2 days she was delirious. Then she died. I don't know why you're asking me all these questions. I don't know why you're treating me this way -- why I have to explain to you who I am when you don't tell me who you are.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: I was 23 years old when the Americans came to my country. I was a good man. I was a soldier. And when they left, I was something different. For the next 6 years I did things I wish I could erase from my memory -- things which I never thought myself to be capable of. But I did come to learn this -- there was a part of me which was always capable. You want to know who I am? My name is Sayid Jarrah, and I am a torturer.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: Where is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: There it is.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: Gotcha.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: Dude, nice catch.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: Well, I'll be damned. All that noise from this tiny critter.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: It kind of reminds me of a turtle I once had. Its name was Stuart. It ran off when I was 10. Well, that's what mom said. I kind of think she threw him out.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER:  Well, you're a happy little fella, ain't ya?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: I have an idea. Why don't I take him -- far from here -- 2 beaches away? Then maybe he'll find a Mrs. Tree Frog. That way he won't keep you up anymore, and everyone's happy.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: Yeah, that's one idea. Here's another.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 HURLEY: Dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAWYER: I hear with a little ranch they taste just like chicken.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Give you a hand?  Jack, I know this isn't--
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Shut up.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Where are the pliers?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Tell me about this balloon.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: This balloon that brought you here with your wife. Tell me about it.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: What do you want to know?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Everything.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: She's 140 feet high, 60 feet wide. And when she's up in the air 550,000 cubic feet of helium and a 100,000 of hot air keep her up. And if you could look down on her you'd see a big yellow smiley face on top.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Why would you travel in that way?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: Because I was rich. Because -- it was my dream. And Jennifer thought it would be neat.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: You "were" rich?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: I guess I'm thinking of things in the past tense now. How's that for optimism?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: What did you do to become so rich?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: I sold my company.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: What kind of company?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: Mining.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: What did you mine?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: We mined non-metallic minerals. I know, everyone wanted to talk to me at cocktail parties.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Give me your hands. Give me your hands!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Where is she buried?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Listen to me. You said you buried your wife. Tell me where.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: What are you going to...?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Where!!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: In the jungle. By the balloon, in the jungle.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: How deep? How deep did you dig the grave?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: I don't -- it was...
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: How deep? How many shovelfuls of earth? Did you use your hands? How long did it take you?!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: I don't remember.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: You would remember! You would remember how deep! You would remember every shovelful, every moment! You would remember what it felt like to place her body inside. You would remember if you buried the woman you loved! You would remember -- if it were true!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: Did you -- did you lose someone? Did you lose someone here on the Island? Did you lose someone, too? What happened to her?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: It was an accident. It was an accident. The woman responsible thought she was someone else -- someone coming to hurt her -- someone like you!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: Just, just... This is all a mistake. Slow down here, okay. Hurting me isn't going to bring her back.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: You know what I lost! Tell me how long!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: No, no! Help! Help me!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Tell me who you are!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Sayid! Sayid!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Open it. Open it now, John!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Jack, this has to happen.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK:   Open that damn door, you understand me! You open it now.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Now!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: What do you want me to say? Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it! Just, please.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID:  I want you to tell me the truth!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Open the door.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Let go of me, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Or what? You want to push the button? Open the door.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: It's under a minute now, John. You better think fast.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: You wouldn't.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: What? I wouldn't what?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: If we don't... You would risk everyone's lives?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: You talked me into pushing that button once, John, but it's yours now. You're the one who won't risk it, you. Me? I don't think anything's going to happen when we get down to zero.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Jack!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: You want to see what's going to happen? Let's just see what's going to happen.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID:  Who are you?!! Who are you?!!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: Okay, right 15, left...
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: You think I'm stupid? You open it!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: He's lying!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Not like this.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 GALE: I'll tell you whatever you want.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: He's lying! He's lying!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: That's enough!
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK:  What the hell was that?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: He is one of them.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Yeah? Did he tell you that?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: Then how do you know?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Because I know. He is one of them.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: I think that Rousseau thought that about you once, Sayid. If I'm not mistaken she strapped you down, she shocked you, all because she thought you were one of them.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: He is.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 LOCKE: He is one of them. To Rousseau, we're all Others. I guess it's all relative, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SGT. AUSTEN: You got a wife, kids?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 INMAN:  I'll take him.  It's over. We're pulling out, not going to Baghdad. So your man Saddam gets to stay in power which means you, in all likelihood, will remain in his employ. Guess you're lucky you have a new skill set you can use.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: What you made me do no human being should ever have to do to another.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 INMAN: 
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: I will never do that again.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 INMAN:  Yeah. Good luck to you, Sayid. Bus fare back to Ramadi.  Let's move out.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: There is a man down in the Hatch. A stranger captured by Rousseau. I beat him. I beat him badly.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 CHARLIE: Why are you telling me this, Sayid?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: Jack asked me how I knew -- knew for sure that this man was lying. How I knew for sure that he was one of them -- one of the Others. I know because I feel no guilt for what I did to him. -- But there is no way I can ever explain that to Jack, or even Locke, because both of them have forgotten.
Lost.Season02.Episode14 CHARLIE: Forgotten? What?
Lost.Season02.Episode14 SAYID: That you were strung up by your neck and left for dead. That Claire was taken and kept for days during which god only knows what happened to her. That these people -- these Others -- are merciless, and can take any one of us whenever they choose. So tell me, Charlie, have you forgotten?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Hey, hey it's okay, sweetie. Shhh. Hey, sweetie, it's alright.  John, John, wake up.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: What? Claire, what?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: He's burning up, and he's got a rash, and -- and I need to find Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: He's, uh, he's on shift at the hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: No, no, Claire, wait. Claire, wait.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I can't, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: No, no, no, you're not walking through the jungle in the middle of the night. I'll go get Jack. I'll send him right back here.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: Don't worry.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: What's going on?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: Baby's got a fever.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: A fever?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: Claire was coming here.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: He asleep?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Not a sound all night. I'll get back here as soon as I can.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE:  Shhh. Hey, hey, sweetie, it's okay. It's okay. Mommy's just going to cool you down, okay. Okay? Shhh, it's okay.  Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: What are you doing here? You stay away from us.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: He's infected, isn't he?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: Your child, he's sick.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Please get away. You get away from us!!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: You don't remember, do you?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE:  Hey, get back! Get away from her! What do you think you're doing here? What are you doing here?! Just get out of our camp.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE:  What happened? What did she say?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: She said there's something wrong with him.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: It's just not like him. He always sleeps through the night. And this rash... I mean, there's something wrong.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Babies get sick, Claire.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Okay, well, the fever and cough?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: It's perfectly normal.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: He hasn't been eating at all.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Claire, he's okay. It's probably roseola. It's a -- a typical virus that's common in children his age, and the rash is a sign of it.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Okay, what's if it's not? What if he caught something really bad -- like some kind of infection?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Infection? Where did you get that idea?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE:  Rousseau was here.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK:  What did she say to you?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: She said she knew he was sick, okay? That he's infected.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Claire, there is no infection. We've been on this island for 2 months and no one's gotten sick. Rousseau's crazy. We're going to let the fever just run its course. It's going to be fine, okay, trust me. I'm going to get back to the hatch. I'll come back in a couple of hours and check on him again, okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE:  Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Hey, I'm sure that if there was something wrong Jack would know.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Are you sure about this? We don't really know her.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I think she can help me.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LIBBY: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 HURLEY: Hey, guys.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: So, you're a shrink, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LIBBY: I'm a clinical psychologist, but "shrink" works, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Can you help people remember things?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LIBBY: I guess it depends on what you need to remember.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: So, it was our second week on the island, I was out in the jungle and I thought I was having the baby. Charlie was with me, and there was this man, Ethan. We thought he was one of us from the plane but he wasn't. So, he took me. He took both of us. And, I don't remember. I don't remember anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: When Jack and I found Charlie he was hanging from a tree -- by his neck.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I have no idea what happened and now I'm seeing these flashes of things and -- you know, I have amnesia. There's 2 weeks missing from my life.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LIBBY: Claire, I don't think you have amnesia. You know, sometimes when something terrible happens to us there's a little switch in your head that flicks on to protect us from having to deal with it. Maybe your memories aren't gone. Maybe you're just blocking them.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Then I need you to unblock them because my baby's sick and they did something to him.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Do you have to go to the bathroom?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Well, just let us know when you do.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: Yeah, I'll look forward to that.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE:  I thought you might like something to read.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: Dostoevsky. You don't have any Stephen King?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: The library's a little outdated.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: Right. Well, thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: What's with the book?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: Just something to pass the time. Did you know that Hemingway was jealous of Dostoevsky?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: No, John, I, I didn't know that.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: He wanted to be the world's greatest writer, but convinced himself that he could never get out from under Dostoevsky's shadow. Kind of sad, really. What are we doing, Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: What are we doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: We can't hide him down here forever. Changing shifts around is going to get people asking questions. I just want to know what the long term plan is.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Well, John, let me ask you this: we don't have a long term plan for the button but we keep pushing it, don't we? Look, until we know who he is -- whether or not he's telling the truth -- we have to keep doing what we're doing. If you've got a better idea let's hear it.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE:  Why don't you let me go?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LIBBY:  We're away from all the noises of the camp. Just breathe. Let your whole body relax, good. Listen to the waves. Good, in and out slowly. Good. Keep your eyes closed. Very relaxed, Claire. Just keep breathing. Now, I want you to visualize yourself when you were pregnant. Keep listening to my voice. Think about what you see.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 VOICE: When was your last check-up, Claire?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I haven't been in a while. I've been busy, you know. I'm going to Los Angeles.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 VOICE: Really?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 VOICE: Traveling in your third trimester -- that's not usually recommended.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Well, there's a family there. I'm, uh, giving the baby up for adoption.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 VOICE: Oh, of course, I understand. The sedative I gave you was very mild. I know these exams can be very stressful.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 VOICE: I'm going to give you a shot now, Claire.  A little medicine for your baby. Don't worry. You're just going to feel a little pinch.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LIBBY: It's okay, you're alright. It's okay. It's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: It was Ethan. I saw Ethan. I saw him. It was Ethan.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LIBBY: Claire, Claire, it's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: No, it's not!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LIBBY: You're alright.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: No, I'm not alright! It was Ethan!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE:  What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LIBBY: I don't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: What did you do?!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LIBBY: Nothing, she just...
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Do it again. Do it again!!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LIBBY: No, Claire. You were screaming...
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I remembered, okay. I saw Ethan. He was there and he was giving me an exam.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LIBBY: Claire, what you saw could be combining experiences of what happened before the crash to the night you were having dreams here on the island.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: No, I know this was real. I was drugged. He did something to me.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Claire, you need to calm down, alright. It's not good for Aaron.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE:  You know what -- Aaron is sick, okay. I need to find that place. That room -- it's real. It's real. And, hey, there's medicine there for the baby. I need to find it. I need to find it. Kate, please help me find it.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: Hello?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: What's the... 
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: Hello? Hello?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE:  Howdy.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: Hello, John. You are alone?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: Not anymore.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: How many of you are...
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Shut -- up.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: I was hoping to borrow a saw.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: Absolutely, right this way.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: I need a gun. And you don't get to ask why.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SAWYER: Well, Thelma, seeing as I got all the guns, I do get to ask why.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: No, you don't.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SAWYER: Yes, I do -- watch. Why?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Just give me a gun, Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SAWYER: Check it out -- I found a new pair of glasses damn near my prescription. Do you like 'em?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Alright, I'm going into the jungle to track down Rousseau.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SAWYER: The French chick? What for?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Claire thinks she knows where there might be some medicine. The baby's sick.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SAWYER: Well, hell, I got medicines.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: She thinks he's really sick -- as in quarantine sick.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SAWYER: What do you think?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: I think she's a little too worried, but she's going after Rousseau with or without me.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SAWYER: No boys allowed, huh?  Alright, what do you want -- 9 millimeter or rifle?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SUN: I don't think this is a good idea. Maybe you should listen to Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: What if Jack's wrong, okay? Jack said the fever would break and it hasn't. He's getting worse.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SUN: Just because it hasn't broken yet...
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Well, how long am I supposed to wait, Sun?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SUN: A mother should not leave her child.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I'm sorry, are you a mother?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SUN: No, I'm not. -- Claire, are you sure you want to do this?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: What did you say?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SUN: Are you sure you want to do this?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE:  Do you have to put that in my tummy? It really, really hurts.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: I know. I wish there was another way. But the baby needs it, Claire. Okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: There, all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: And now, because you've been such a good girl, I think it's time for a surprise.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Claire, this way. Here we go. Over here.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: What is this place?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: It's for your baby, Claire.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Uh, it's amazing. What happened to Charlie?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Charlie? Oh, he's fine. When we got far enough away from camp, I let him go back.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Oh. So, where did it all come from?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Well, I'd love to explain everything to you, Claire, but I'm afraid it would be a little overwhelming right now.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Go ahead, turn it on.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 VOICE:  Ethan.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Wait here, I'll be right back.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 VOICE: What the hell happened? You were supposed to make the list and then bring her in. Was I unclear?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: It's not my fault. They knew I wasn't on the plane. They had a manifest.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 MR. FRIENDLY: What am I supposed to tell him? You know what he's going to do when he finds out. Damn it, Ethan.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SUN: Claire? Claire, are you alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I, um...
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE:  Ready to go?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Aaron, sweetheart, shhhh. Mommy's got to go now, sweetheart. Don't cry. Don't cry. I'll be back really soon and I'm going to make you feel all better, okay. I promise.  Thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 SUN: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: You okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: You're sure this is her trail?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: We started at the exact spot where we chased her off the beach.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: So, what do you know about Rousseau?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Not much.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: You spent all that time with her when you went out to the Black Rock. You must have talked about something.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Just about her ship crashing here -- her and her research team getting stranded.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: What happened to them?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: They died.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: How?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Uhm, tracks are gone -- trail ends here.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Kate, how did they die?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: She killed them.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: What? Why, why would...
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE:  Because they were infected. You believe me now, don't you?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I want you to take me back there.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: Back?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: To where I scratched you.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Claire.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: No, okay, she knows I remember! Hey, I remember a lot of it now. I remember the room, the medicine, a teenage girl. Okay, so don't lie to me and make out you don't know what I'm talking about. My baby is sick and you're going to take me back there to get what he needs. Right now!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: It's not far from here.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: Jack, may I have a word with you?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: Who is he?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: The man that you are keeping in the hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Did Locke tell you?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: Locke did not tell me anything. Who is he? I wish to speak to him.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Speak to him about what?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: I wish to speak to him alone. Can you arrange this?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: Why should I do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: Because you wish to keep this a secret.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Why are we stopping here?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: This is where you scratched me.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: But there's nothing here.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: Where do we go next?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Why are you asking me that? You need to tell me where to go.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: Where is this room?!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: How can you be saying that? Okay, you grabbed me, that's why I scratched you -- because you were taking me back to them!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: Is that what you think? You said you remembered! That's why I brought you here! You lied! 
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE:  Hey, get your hands off of her!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: Go ahead, please. Do it.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Claire! Claire!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: How's it coming?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE:  One down, one to go.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Now all we need is a little foot to put it on, huh?  Tell you what, what do you say we sneak out of here and take a walk?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Whoa . I'm sorry this is the first time I've managed to get you out. My friends are afraid you'll run away. Whoa! Whoa. Don't tell on me, okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Whoa, easy now. Alright, easy.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Okay, here, this will help.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Thanks  Ew.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: That's really sour.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Is it? I hadn't noticed.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Bah. -- Oh, hey, it's kicking!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: May I?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN:  Claire, can I tell you a secret?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: I'm going to miss you. I wish -- I wish you didn't have to go.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Maybe I don't have to go?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: We've been through this, Claire. There's not enough vaccine for you and the baby.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Well, I'm not, I'm not sick.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Thank God. And once you've delivered you can go back to your friends and hopefully you'll stay that way.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: What if I want to see the baby?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Hey, nobody's going to take him from you unless that's what you want. You have a choice. We're good people, Claire. We're a good family. But if you're going to trust us with your child I want you to be sure. Okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE:  Sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: There you are. Where are you going?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE:  I know this is it.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Claire!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: Leave her alone.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Excuse me?!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: Let her look.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Look for what? Claire! Claire!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Flashlights. The lights, I'm going to see if I can turn the power on.  You okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: This way.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: What is this place?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: It's where they were going to keep him.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 
YOUNG GIRL: Wake up.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Who are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 YOUNG GIRL: Shhh. He'll hear you. Look, you have to get out of here.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 YOUNG GIRL: You have to get out of here, now.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: What? No, no, no, I can't leave.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 YOUNG GIRL: Yes, you can.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I can't leave. No. What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 YOUNG GIRL: Don't scream. They're going to do it tonight.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Do what?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 YOUNG GIRL:  Shhhh.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 YOUNG GIRL: You're going to die. They're going to cut him out of you! I can get you back to your camp, but we have to leave. Now!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: No, no, no, hey, you're lying. You're lying, okay. I'm sure about this, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 YOUNG GIRL:  Shhhh.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Get Ethan, I want to talk to Ethan. Ethan wouldn't hurt me. Ethan wouldn't...
Lost.Season02.Episode15 YOUNG GIRL: You'll thank me for this one day.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: It's here. The medicine's here.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Help me.  Help! Kate, come here, I need some help!  Help me open this.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: What is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: It's in here. The vaccine's in here.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 KATE: Okay, 1-2-3.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: It was in here. The vaccine was in here! Okay, where is it? Where is it? Where it is? The vaccine was in here! Where is it?!  You were bringing me back here -- where is it?! You know where it is, don't you?! Tell me! Tell me where it is! Tell me!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Ethan. Ethan. Ethan? Ethan, I'm sure. Ethan? Hey, hey, Ethan! Ethan! I'm sure. I want you to take the baby. Ethan?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Who are -- who are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN:  Claire!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Yeah! I'm here!!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: I can hear you, where are you?!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: Quiet.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I'm here, Ethan!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: Be quiet.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I have to -- I have to give him to them.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 ETHAN: Claire!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I have to give him to them so he'll be safe, okay. Help! I'm here! Ethan!!
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: You weren't trying to take me back, were you? You were trying to save me.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: I carried you on my back to your camp. I left you where they would find you.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I'm sorry.  Where are you going?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: You're not the only one who didn't find what they were looking for.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: This is as far as I go.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Your baby -- was it a girl?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: What was her name?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: Alex -- Alexandra.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: I remember a girl -- a girl with blue eyes. She helped me. She saved me, just like you did. She wasn't like the others. She was -- good.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 DANIELLE: I'm sorry that you didn't find what you were looking for. And I hope you're baby's not infected. But if it is, I hope you know what must be done. 
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: Back for more tools?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: He knows, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: Well, there you go.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK:  Just be careful what you say to him. He's smart and curious. Just give us a shout when you're done.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: If the alarm goes off, don't tell him what it's for.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: What is it for?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO:  Hello. I am Mr. Eko.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: Henry Gale.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: Do you mind if I sit, Henry?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: How long have you been in here?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: 2 days.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: Are they treating you well?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: Treating me well? I'm a prisoner. And I don't know why, or for what, or...
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: You are a prisoner because they are being careful. They are being careful because they believe you are lying.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: Why would I lie? They think I'm one of these others -- other what?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: Please, stop talking, Henry. The first night I spent on this island I was dragged into the jungle by 2 men. They never spoke a word to me, nor I to them. I killed these men -- smashed in their head with a stone, felt their blood on my arms. I need you to know how sorry I am for this. I need you to know that I am back on the righteous path now. And that I regret my actions. I ask you for your forgiveness.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: Why are you telling me this?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 EKO: Because I needed to tell someone.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: He looks good -- fever's broken, the rash is even starting to fade.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE: Thank you so much.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 JACK: I didn't do anything. I'll check back in a couple hours, okay? 
Lost.Season02.Episode15 CLAIRE:  Look, Mommy made this for you when you were still inside her tummy.  You know, I wanted them to take you. But now I know -- I know that we're supposed to be together, you and me. We're supposed to take care of each other, okay. -- You're mine and I love you. I love you so much.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: No cheeseburgers, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: No cheeseburgers. Bon appetit.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: Is that true -- what you said about Hemingway?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: You have good ears.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: You have thin doors.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: You read Hemingway?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: Sure, guy ran with the bulls, fought in the Spanish Civil War, stuff I can wrap my brain around. This, I can't get through 5 pages of .
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: Well, Dostoevsky had his virtues, too. He was a genius, for one. Bullfighting isn't everything.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: So, which one are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: Are you the genius, or are you the guy who always feels like he's living in the shadow of a genius?
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: I was -- I was never very much into literary analysis.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: I just don't understand why you let the doctor call the shots.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 LOCKE: No one calls the shots. Jack and I make decisions together.
Lost.Season02.Episode15 GALE: Right, okay. -- My mistake.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 자기야, 뭐 해? 안 자? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 곧 가요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 와, 근사한데. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 왜 그래... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 돌아 봐 봐. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 자기야... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 한 번만. 부탁합니다, 돌아봐 주세요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 체온은 쟀지? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 분위기 다 망치네. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 미안해. 난 그저... 지난 1년 동안 노력해도 아무 소식이 없어서... 우리 병원에 가자. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 병원? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 불임 전문의한테. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 애랑 놀아줄 시간도 없으면서 애 욕심은... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 내 핑계 대지 마. 다 일 때문에... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 일 때문에? 피 묻힌 손으로 집에 들어오는 것은 일이 아니에요! 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 당신은 내 손에 왜 피가 묻었다고 생각해? 어? 피를 묻히게 한 사람은 당신 아버지야! 다 아버님이 시킨거야!  
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 다른 뜻은 없었어... 정말 미안해. 우리한테 애가 생기면, 아버님도 생각이 바뀌실 걸? 손주가 생기면 혹시 알아? 좀 더 안전한 일자리를 주실지... 아이가 생기면 모든게 변할 거야. 아이만 생기면 다... 좋아질거야. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 여보! 깜짝이야.  
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 얼마나 찾았는데! 여기서 뭐 하고 있는거야! 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 뭐 하기는? 밭에서 일하고 있잖아요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 어서 돌아가자! 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 뭐? 싫어! 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 당장 가자니까! 또 납치당하고 싶어? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 뭐라구요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 바로 여기서 놈들한테 당했잖아! 우리 얘기한거 다 잊어먹었어? 가자 어서! 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 이런 식으로 날 보호할 필요는 없어요! 그냥 내 밭에서 일하게 내버려 둬. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 뭐? 내 밭? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 뭐 하는 거야! 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 이제 여기 올 필요 없지? 이제 갈까? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: You were running like the devil's chasing you.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Maybe he is.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: Good for you, keeping in shape.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: What do you want, Locke?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: What do I want?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: I've been here over a week -- you've never said 2 words to me. And now you're sitting outside my tent?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: We've got a man locked up down in the Hatch. There's a possibility he's one of them -- the Others.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Who's we?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: Me and Jack. He's keeping watch right now.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: How long's he been down there?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: 3 days. I'd like you to talk with him. You have experience with the Others. You were a cop. Seems to me you're the most qualified to figure out if this man's telling the truth.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Does Jack know you're coming to me with this?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: We've got a serious problem, Ana Lucia -- all of us. I'm taking the necessary steps to solve it. I don't need Jack's permission to talk with you because right now there's a man sitting in a room in my hatch and I want him out.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ROSE: I don't have to give you anything. It's the thought that counts. You just didn't think.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 BERNARD: I think all the time. You know, maybe you should think about giving me a little bit of a break here.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ROSE: Oh, just hush, Bernard. Just hush.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ROSE: Honey? Are you alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: I'm -- I think I'm just a little lightheaded.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 BERNARD: You look as pale as a sheet.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ROSE: Well, give her some water.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 BERNARD: Yes, ma'am.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ROSE: Don't pay him any mind, honey. He's just mad at the world because he forgot my birthday.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 BERNARD: I didn't forget. I don't even know what day of the week it is, Rose.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ROSE: It's Saturday, Bernard.  Honey, can you walk?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: Really, I'm alright.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 BERNARD: Maybe we should go get Jin?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: No -- I think I was just out in the sun too long.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ROSE: Well, you spent a lot of time around the baby maybe you caught something. At least talk to Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: Really, I'm okay. Thank you -- both of you.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: 교통이 많이 막히진 않았죠? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN:  맨날 똑같죠, 뭐. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: 진수 씨가 여기 오는거 아시죠? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 아니오. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: 난 얘기할 줄 알았는데... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 그럴 수가 없었어요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 많이 바쁘실 텐데, 이렇게 시간 내주셔서 고마워요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: 호텔 매니저나 회장님 외아들만이 할 수 있잖아요... 근무 시간이 자유로운 편인거.  방도 이 정도면 괜찮은 것 같은데요. 마실 것 좀 드릴까요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 그냥 아이스티 주세요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: In English.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN:  I would like iced-tea, please.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: Very good.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: 괜찮아요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 네. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: 무슨 고민 있으세요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 아니에요... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: 나중에라도 마음이 바뀌시면... 뭐 그렇다고 제가 충고할 입장도 아니지만... 그래도 선 씨가 영어를 잘 하시면 진수씨가 좋아하실걸요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 어떻게 배웠냐고... 누구한테 배웠냐고 하면 뭐라고 해요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: 우리가 이렇게 만나는 것이 불편하시면 그만 하죠. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 그러길 원하세요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: 아니오. 사실은 저한테도 공부가 많이 돼요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: Morning, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: You couldn't wait 'til I was done in here?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: The steam opens up my pores. A man's got no shaving cream, he's got to improvise. I also thought this might be a good time to talk about our problem.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: Our problem?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: Our Henry problem. We've had him locked up for 3 days now, and I can't help but get the sense that he's just not motivated to cooperate with us.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: And how are we going to motivate him?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: I don't think there's anything we can do. I think we need to bring in some new blood.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: Obviously, you have someone in mind.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: What do you think about Ana Lucia?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: Why her?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: She's the one you went to to start an army to fight these people -- why not her? Unless you're worried about what she'll do to him.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: I'll talk to her.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: I already did. In there with him now.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: Were you on the plane, too?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: I was in the tail section. We crashed on the other side of the Island.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: You walked across all the way here? That must have been fun.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: It had its moments. So, are you going to tell me your story, Henry?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: Why bother, I've already told it to everyone -- Jack, Locke, the big black guy that cut off his beard in front of me. Oh, yeah, and my buddy, Sayid. You can see how much he liked my story.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: So how about you try me.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: I don't mean to be ungrateful, but why are you going to help me get out of here?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: On the other side of the Island there was this guy with us. I was 100 percent convinced that he wasn't on the plane. So I dug a hole and I threw him in it.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: And what happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: I was wrong. And now he's dead. But good news for you Henry -- I don't make the same mistake twice. So how about you tell me your story?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: Sawyer?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, hey there, Sunshine, what can I do for you?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: How's your book?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAWYER: Predictable -- not nearly enough sex.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: I heard that you have all the medical supplies.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAWYER: You heard correct.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: May I look through them?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAWYER:  No you may not. But if you'll tell me what you're looking for...
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: Forget it.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAWYER:  Okay, hold on. Now I'm intrigued. Tell you what, tell me what you're looking for and it's yours, gratis.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: Can't I just look myself?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAWYER: It's not a drugstore, sweetheart.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: I need a pregnancy test.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: Can't hear anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: She's only been in there about 30 minutes.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: How do you know he hasn't snapped her neck, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: How do you know she hasn't snapped his?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: So let me get this straight -- you and your wife travel around the world and crash here in a smiley-face balloon? Then she dies. You get captured by a French chick who brings you here, and then they lock you up.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: It sounds kind of silly when you say it like that.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Why don't you have a beard?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: Because I shaved -- because I needed something normal.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Okay, so why don't you draw me a map to your balloon? We'll go out there, we'll find it, and everybody will believe you.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: That's what they all keep asking me to do -- draw a map. And if I mess up they'll crucify me.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: You flew around the world in a balloon and you don't think you can draw up a good map?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: Air travel -- it's a different animal. It's about wind currents and...
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Do you or do you not know where it is?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: Yeah, I know where it is. I went back there to bury my wife.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Why'd you do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: Because our balloon was the closest thing we had to home. You people have been looking for someone to punish for everything that's happened to you -- someone to blame -- and now you've got him. It doesn't matter what I do, I'm dead already.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: You draw up that map, Henry. I'll find your balloon. But if you don't, things are going to play out just like you said.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 HURLEY: Hey, Sun. Look what I found in the middle of the jungle. It's not even melted or nothing. Crazy, huh? You want to split it?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: No. No, thank you. I was just heading to the beach.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 HURLEY: Okay, well, later, dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 DR. KIM: 안녕하세요, 미스터 권. 아, 선화 씨. 죄송합니다, 오래 기다리게 해서. 아버님은 건강하시죠? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 네, 덕분에요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 DR. KIM: 아버님께 안부 좀 전해주시죠. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 그럼요. 다른 환자분들도 많으실 텐데 이렇게 시간 내 주셔서 감사합니다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN:  선생님, 결과는요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 DR. KIM: 말씀드리기가... 별로 좋지 않습니다. 초음파 검사 결과, 부인의 나팔관은 조직 상처로 인해 다 막혀있습니다. 그래서... 수술을 하더라도... 임신 가능성은... 불가능합니다
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 고칠 수 없을까요? 어떻게 해서라도... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 DR. KIM: 글쎄, 저는... 죄송합니다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 결혼하기 전부터 알고 있었어? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 뭐요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 전혀 몰랐단 말야? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 이런 사실을 내가 왜 숨기겠어요? 아, 그렇지. 내가 어떻게 당신같은 잘난 남자를 꼬셨겠어요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Coming out.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: He told me the same story he told you.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: You believe him?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: I don't know yet. I need more time with him.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: He's all yours.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Tomorrow. I want to give him some time to think.  If that's okay with you.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: I didn't tell anyone, Ana.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: No worries, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 CHARLIE: A bit large for a dining room table, isn't it?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: If we cut them in two, it will suit the purpose.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA:  Sayid, can I talk to you?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: Of course.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Alone?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: Whatever you need to say you can say it here.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: It's about the Hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 CHARLIE: You mean the guy locked in the closet there? What about him?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: It's to his balloon.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: How did you get him to do this?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: I asked nicely.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: Do Jack and Locke know about this?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Jack and Locke are a little too busy worrying about Locke and Jack. All I want to know is if this guy's telling the truth.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: Why come to me?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Judging from what you did to his face that's what you want, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: This is at least a day's walk.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Then we should get going.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: You okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 CHARLIE: I'm alright. Thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID:  That cliff there appears to be this .
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Score one for Henry.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: Pointing out a geographical touchstone does not mean he's leading us to a balloon.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Maybe not, but at least we're on the right island.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 CHARLIE: Humor's not his strong suit.  And I'm saying this to you.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 CHARLIE: You looking at my bum?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: No, I'm looking at your gun.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 CHARLIE: My what?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Maybe you should give the gun to somebody who knows how to use it.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 CHARLIE: Maybe I will. As I recall, the last time you had a gun you murdered someone.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: That's enough.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: We'll go as far as the base of the cliff and we'll camp there.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: How long is it supposed to take?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 KATE: Uh, up to two minutes.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: I'm sorry -- I'm just...
Lost.Season02.Episode16 KATE: I know. Where did Sawyer find one of these anyway? I mean, who flies with a pregnancy test, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: Have you ever taken one?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: Thank you for waiting with me and not asking why you're here and not Jin.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 KATE: You're welcome. It's time.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 KATE: You're pregnant.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: Is it 100 percent sure?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 KATE: There's only one way to find out.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: These tests are pretty accurate. You know, a false negative in the first week maybe, but positive is a positive.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: But it's impossible.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: Oh, it's possible. You feeling queasy, lightheaded?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: Please, Jack. This is private, nobody can know.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 KATE: You're not going to tell Jin?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: In time I will, it's just -- it's complicated.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: As complicated as Jin being the last one on the Island to find out you spoke English? Sun, my advice -- and it's just that because I'm the last person to ask about this, but -- you should tell him. And when you do, you should tell him everything -- the whole truth. I'm going to get back to the Hatch. Congratulations, Sun.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 KATE: You've been down there a lot, Jack. Is everything okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: Sure, yeah, everything's fine. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 KATE: Are you okay? Sun?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: Sun? Sun. Sun are you alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: Yes, I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: You were distracted for our entire lesson. You're not fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: We -- Jin and I went to see a doctor. He said I cannot have children.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: I'm very sorry, Sun.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: I was glad.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: 우리가 여기서 뭐하는 거죠? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 저한테 영어를 가르쳐 주시고 있잖아요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: 선 씨는 이미 한달 전부터 영어를 유창하게 하는데요, 왜 영어를 배우려는 거죠? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 저... 미국에 가려고요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: 진수 씨하고... 헤어질 생각이세요? 난 한 여자 때문에 미국으로 도망갔었어요. 그것이 사랑인줄 알고... 하지만 자기 인생에서 도망갈 순 없죠. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 그럼... 그 사람이 제 인생의 전부인가요? 저는요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JAE: I'm not saying you should stay for Jin.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Do you mind?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: You should sleep while you can.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: Yeah, I can't sleep. People don't like me. I tried to get them to most of my life. I guess I just gave up a while back. I mean, I am what I am. But you -- you've got a good reason to hate me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I did.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: You were trying to protect your people. It wasn't you that killed Shannon; it was them. And once we find out he is one of them then something will have to be done.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA:  What?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: Nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: It's going to rain.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: We should get moving.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 CHARLIE:  Morning! Who wants breakfast? I have papayas and papayas.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: Let's go.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 CHARLIE: Right, why eat?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID:  This is it.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 CHARLIE: This balloon would be rather large, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: Why am I not surprised?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: We need to look some more.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: This is where he said it would be.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 ANA: If I'm going to back your play on this, Sayid, we need to be sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAYID: I'll divide the area into 3 grids, so search as thoroughly as you please.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 BERNARD: Oh, for the love of god.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 펼쳐 놔야지. 한데 모아놓지 말고, 펼쳐 놔야 돼.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 BERNARD: Oh, no, no, no, it's not for fish.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 아니, 아뇨...
Lost.Season02.Episode16 BERNARD: No, no, no, oysters.  Pearl, for Rose.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: Ahhh.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 BERNARD: Pearl.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN:  시간 낭비하지 마세요. No oyster. No oyster here.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 BERNARD: Ah, of course not. Why would there be?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAWYER:  Yo, Daddy-o.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAWYER: Way to go, Papa-san. You didn't waste much time. I'd give you a cigar, Bernie, but I'm fresh out.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 BERNARD: Sun's pregnant?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SAWYER: Keep it down there, Suzie; I don't think Jin Sr. here knows yet.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 여기서 뭐하는 거에요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 내가 잘못했으니까 바로 해 놔야지. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 그럴 필요는 없는데... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 아니, 내가 그렇게 했잖아. 자기야... 난 니가 필요해. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 네? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 난 이런건 너무 싫어. 자꾸 싸우는 거. 근데 내가 어떻게 해야... 다른 사람들하고 얘기도 할 수 없어. 의사소통이 전혀 안 돼. 난 당신이 필요해. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 진수 씨, 난... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 아냐, 괜찮아... 미안하다. 다 내가 못나서... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 나 임신했어요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 뭐? 임신? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 임신이요, 여보. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 진수 씨, 내 말 좀 들어. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 왜? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 당신한테... 당신한테 할 얘기가 있어요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 DR. KIM: 백선화 씨! 선 씨! 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 김 선생님? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 DR. KIM: 잠깐 차에 타시죠. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 왜요? 무슨 일이시죠? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 DR. KIM: 잠시 드릴 말씀이 있습니다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 DR. KIM: 잠시만요! 잠깐이면 돼요. 선 씨, 지난번엔 제가 큰 잘못을 했습니다. 사실은요, 선 씨에게 문제가 있는게 아니고요... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 네? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 DR. KIM: 부군에게 문제가 있습니다. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 아니, 뭐 때문에 그런... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 DR. KIM: 그땐 제가 어떻게 할 수가 없었어요. 죄송합니다, 정말 죄송합니다. 부군께서 아버님 밑에서 일하지 않습니까. 그런 사람에게 제가 사실대로 마냥 다 얘기했다면 그 분은 제 병원을 불살라 버렸을 겁니다!  
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 왜 이 얘기를 이제 하시는 거죠? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 DR. KIM: 선 씨가 이 사실을 다 아셔야 하니까요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 왜 나한테 얘기 안 했어? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 어떻게 얘기를 해요... 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 아니 만약 내가... 나한테 문제가 있다면... 어떻게 아이가 생길 수 있지? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 당신한테 맹세하는데... 나한테는 당신 뿐이야. 그게 사실이고. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN:  그랬다면... 이건 기적이야. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 만약 아들이면, 우리 아버지 이름에서 한 자를 따면 어떨까? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 하나는 우리 엄마 이름으로 해요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 사람들에게 알려도 돼? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 잭하고 케이트는 벌써 알고 있고... 아마 소이어도 알고 있을 거에요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN:  Daddy-o. 그럼 버나드도 알고 있겠네? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 섬에서 아마 모르는 사람 없을걸요? 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN: 배 안 고파? 우리 점심 먹으러 가자. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 나, 한 20분만이라도 혼자 있고 싶은데... 그냥 혼자서... 당신이 괜찮다면. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN:  그럼 그렇게 해. 바닷가에서 보자. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 SUN: 사랑해. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JIN:  I love you. 
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: How is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE:  Men reject their prophets and slay them, but they love their martyrs and honor those whom they have slain.  So what's the difference between a martyr and a prophet?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: Either way, it sounds like you end up dead.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: That's the spirit.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: In the mood for some breakfast?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: What's the computer for?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: Nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: Cereal? Wow, where'd you guys get cereal?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: It was down here all along. The pantry's full of food.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: How old is it?  You guys don't know much, huh? I mean, I'd be asking all kinds of questions about all this stuff down here. You guys don't even seem that curious.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK: Do you want the cereal or don't you?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: This must be my reward for good behavior, huh? I guess I earned myself some good will for finally drawing that map for Ana.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: What map?
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: To my balloon.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 JACK:  Did you...
Lost.Season02.Episode16 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode16 GALE: Wow, you guys have some real trust issues, don't you? Guess it makes sense she didn't tell you. I mean, with the two of you fighting all the time. Of course, if I was one of them -- these people that you seem to think are your enemies -- what would I do? Well, there'd be no balloon, so I'd draw a map to a real secluded place like a cave or some underbrush -- good place for a trap -- an ambush. And when your friends got there a bunch of my people would be waiting for them. Then they'd use them to trade for me. I guess it's a good thing I'm not one of them, huh? You guys got any milk?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN:  So, what did I do to deserve this?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: What, can't a fella take his girl out for a picnic lunch just because?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: Fella?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE:  That's right, fella.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: Where are you taking me?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: I'm not telling, so just quit asking.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: Can I be of any help?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: You just read your obituaries and drink your coffee and I'll take care of the everything.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: Don't knock the obits -- the nicest part of the paper. No one ever says anything mean about people once they're dead.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Mmm, and here I am thinking the funnies are the nicest part of the paper.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: John? John, what's your father's name?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: Is it Anthony -- Anthony Cooper?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Yes, that's right.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: He's dead.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK:  Draw it again -- the map to your balloon.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: I was joking. I was making a joke. There's nothing out there besides my balloon. I was just frustrated. It was a stupid thing to say. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: It's too late anyway. She's already long gone, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: So, what's done is done?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: That's right.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Put him back in the armory. 
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Why do you let him talk to you like that?  Hey, wait, I...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Shut up!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: John, I'm sorry. John?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 ANA: Maybe he's wrong. We should search the other side of the cliff.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAYID: We've been searching for 3 hours. This balloon does not exist.  Charlie!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 ANA: Then why did he draw the map?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAYID: You told him you would protect him whether we found this balloon or not. You've given him 2 more days to talk -- to figure how to escape. We're done.  Charlie!!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 CHARLIE:  Over here! This way!  Sayid!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 CHARLIE: He said he buried her, right? His wife?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 ANA: Why isn't it raining here?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Hurley, you seen Ana Lucia?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HURLEY: She took off into the jungle with Charlie and Sayid yesterday.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Yesterday -- they say anything about where they were going?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HURLEY: Well, that would, like, assume that anyone actually tells me anything. Maybe if I were in the loop I could be more helpful.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: There is no loop, Hurley.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 CLAIRE:  Excuse me, Jack. He's been really hot and fussy. Do you mind having a look at him?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Yeah, sure, sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HURLEY:  Loop, dude, loop.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 CLAIRE: So, the fever's completely gone?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Completely.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 CLAIRE: You're not just saying that, right? You seem a bit distracted.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: No, I'm fine. And so is Aaron.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 CLAIRE: Thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LIBBY:  Doctor still in? I was grabbing for mussels in the tide pool -- pissed off a sea urchin.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Well, it doesn't look infected. A little Neosporin wouldn't hurt.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LIBBY: Yeah, right, Neosporin.  I think the current rate of exchange is 10 loads of laundry for a tube.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Right.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOUDSPEAKER VOICE: 20 minutes to lockdown.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOUDSPEAKER VOICE: ... 17 minutes to lockdown.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: What was that? John, what's the matter?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: You sure you want to do this?  We could just go on that picnic, you know.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Soon, I promise.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: Hey, maybe he left you his kidney?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 FATHER CHUCK: For we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will live with the Lord forever.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 FATHER CHUCK: We commit the soul of Anthony Cooper to you, but we shall never be separated. And now we are united with Christ as we go toward him. Amen.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 FATHER CHUCK: Do you wish to say anything, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE:  I forgive you.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOUDSPEAKER VOICE: ... please proceed... protocol... please proceed...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: John? Hey, you out there? What's that noise? John? What's going on? Talk to me.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Will you be quiet!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Tell me what's happening, what the hell is...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Will you shut up!!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOUDSPEAKER VOICE: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Maybe you should get Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: I said, shut up!!!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOUDSPEAKER VOICE: 2, 1.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HURLEY: I bet 4 papayas.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: You can't bet; I just bet. You can either call or raise or lay 'em down, Muttonchops.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: Don't look at me.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK:  Lay 'em down, Hurley. He's got you beat.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HURLEY: Dude, I got a killer hand, here.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: No, you don't.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HURLEY: But you don't even know...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: You've a baby straight. He's got the flush.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: What about me? What do I got?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Hard to say, but you're just playing for the fun of it.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: Well, fun's not bad. You should try it sometime.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK:  Don't call him, Hurley.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER:  Hey, Amarillo Slim -- you think because you watch poker on TV you can tussle with the big boys?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: I've got to head back to the Hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: Hatch ain't going nowhere, Doc. How about you put your mangoes where your mouth is?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: I guess I could play a hand or two.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Hey, what's going on?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Are you still out there? John? John?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: I'm here.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: What were those noises?! What's wrong?! Did something...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Nothing is wrong!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 NADIA: So what's the verdict, Mr. Locke?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: The seismic bolting is all first rate; there's no visible mold, no dry rot. It'll all be in my report, but I think you and your husband got a pretty nice house.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 NADIA: If I had a husband I'm sure he would be happy to hear that.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: If you'll just sign this invoice.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: Hello, son.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: What do you want?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: Look, John, I know what I did to you was wrong.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: You stole my kidney.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: I was dying.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: You could've asked me. You could have just asked me. What do you want from me?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: I killed myself off because there are 2 men out there who were going to beat me to it.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: What'd you do, steal their livers?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: No, I took them for 700,000 dollars -- retirement con. I put the money in a safe deposit box, but these 2 guys may be sitting on the bank to see if I show my face -- which is why I need you to go in there and get it for me.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: You think I'm stupid?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: I want you to take 200 grand of it. It won't make up for what I did to you, but it's the best I can do. I'll be at the Flightline motel -- it's out by the airport -- until tomorrow afternoon. Then I'm gone, money or no money. And, John, if I don't see you again? I'll understand.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: We're locked in.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: These blast doors came down. The whole living area is sealed off. I can't get out.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Did you try to pry...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Yeah, but I couldn't -- maybe, maybe if the 2 of us.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: You want me to help you?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: And if I do help you get these doors up then you're just going to lock me back in here, aren't you?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: That's right.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Then I'm going to need your word, John. I'm going to need your word that you won't let your people do anything to me.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Well, if you're who you say you are then what are you worried about?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Things have happened to them -- things that I have nothing to do with. But they've got no one to blame except for me. So I'm going to need your word that you'll protect me, no matter what.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Who are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: My name is Henry Gale. I'm from Minnesota. And I crashed on this island just like you.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Alright, you have my word.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HURLEY: Dude, you got me.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: I'm out.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: Think you're in my head, Doc?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: You've still got 3 papayas -- call or fold.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: Well, you're in trouble now, Cool Hand. Pocket queens makes me the set. 
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK:  King's wired.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HURLEY: Whoa, dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: But at least I'm not in your head. Well, I guess that's it.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: What do you mean, "it"?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Sawyer, you're busted. I got it all. It wouldn't really be fair for you to go pick more mangoes.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: Oh, I've got a hell of lot more than mangoes. You want to play real stakes, name 'em?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK:  It's a pile of fruit, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: And I want it back.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: Should I go and get a ruler?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER:  Fun time's over, Mongo. Why don't you go hit the buffet?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HURLEY: But, I want to...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: Come on, Hurley. Let's go leave these boys to their sandbox.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: One more hand, Doc. What's it going to take?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: The medicine you stole from the armory, all of it.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Let's go. Harder.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: I'm losing it.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: The tool box. Get the tool box -- that'll hold it.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: You sure?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Get it! Come on, put it under.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: John, John, wait, don't just...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: You have to stop the door. Put something else under the door. Come on, come on.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Stack 'em, stack 'em. You have to stop the pressure. Come on, come on, come on.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Alright, alright, let's get you out. Come on.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Alright, we'll wait 'til somebody comes down. Alright? It's only a matter of time, yeah?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: No we don't have time.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Honey, put on your Sunday best! I'm taking you out to paint...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: John, we have visitors.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: Um, these men say they knew your father.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 BANE: Hi, John, I'm Jimmy Bane.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: I'm sure Helen told you I didn't really know him...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 BANE: She told me. But I'd like to ask you a couple questions if that's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Sure, of course.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 BANE: Have you seen your father since he died, Mr. Locke?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Wh-have-have I...?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 BANE: Well, we were thinking possibly he's not dead, and maybe you know that? I mean, for his son, you didn't look too shook up at his funeral.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: How dare you? If you had any idea what that man did to him -- what that son-of-bitch...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Helen, hey Helen.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: We were there to get past him, to get on with our lives, to let him go. Get out of here.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Helen, hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 BANE: Okay. Okay, just one thing before we go. What's in the bag, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Work papers and stuff. I'm a home inspector.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 BANE: You won't mind if we take a look?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 BANE: Well, there you go. Thanks for the coffee, miss. 
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Helen, I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: Were you lying to those men, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: No, I was scared. I was -- I was scared.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: So, where'd you learn to play cards, Doc?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Phuket.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: What the hell were you doing in Thailand?  What, you don't think I know where Phuket is? Just because I dropped out in 9th grade don't make me an idiot. Far East, huh? I wouldn't have taken you for a world traveler. That where you got the art on your shoulder?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: How about you deal again?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: This time from the top of the deck.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER:  Well, I had to try.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: What does it do?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: We're not exactly sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: And you push it...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Every 108 minutes, yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: How soon does this alarm go off?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Very -- which is why I need you to go up through the grate and into the vents.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Grate's bolted shut. I tried it.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: There's another grate in the pantry. You can get up through there. Take the vent into the dome.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Maybe we should wait.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: We can't wait; it's going to go off any minute. I trusted you, Henry, now you've got to trust me. That button has to be pushed.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Okay, what do I do?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Once you're inside, you'll hear the alarm beeping, and you just have to enter the Numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, and then you press execute. It has to be exactly those numbers in exactly that order. Now do you...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. I got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Can you reach it?!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: I think so.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Be careful!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Henry?!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Henry?!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LIBBY: What's going on?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HURLEY: Jack and Sawyer are finally going to beat each other up.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: 10 mangoes.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: Okay, I'll call you with the aspirin and raise you with a bottle of Amoxicilin.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Do you even know what Amoxicilin is?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: You may have been to Phuket, Doc, but I've been to Tallahassee.  Let's just say something was burning and it wasn't from the sunshine.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: I'm all in.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: Well, that's the move of a man who wants me to lay it down.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: You're not going to lay it down.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: I'm not, huh? Why's that?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Because there's a bunch of people watching us right now and you don't want them to see you lose. Again.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: Well alright, I call. What you got?  Pair a 9s? You pushed in with a pair of 9's?!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: You got me. Let's see 'em.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Guess it was enough, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: Son-of-a-bitch.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: I'll come get the meds later. 
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAWYER: Hey, when I asked you what you wanted for stakes -- why didn't you ask for the guns?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: When I need the guns, I'll get the guns.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Henry, get up, damn it. Henry!  Henry, are you alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Listen to me, you have to get up into the vents and enter the numbers in the computer.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: How long was I...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Please, you have to go right now; we're running out of time!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE:  Okay, yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Be careful!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Henry?!  Henry, can you hear me?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Henry? Henry?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: Yeah, who is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: It's John.  Can I come in?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: Yeah, of course.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: Any problems.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Nope.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: Your date at my funeral -- she got a name?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Helen.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: That's a nice name -- pretty girl, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: I'm, uh, I'm going to ask her to marry me -- tonight, actually.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER:  Well, good for you. Congratulations.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Yeah, thanks.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: Your share -- should buy you a nice honeymoon.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: I didn't do this for the money.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: Then why did you do it?  Well, alright, um -- my plane, I gotta -- I gotta cab waiting. If you don't want the cash, the maid's going to get a hell of a tip. Bye, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: Are you him?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 COOPER: Listen, sweetheart...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN:  How could you? How could you do this to him? We were moving past this.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Helen, wait.  Helen, wait, you don't understand. I was going to tell you everything.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: You lied to me.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: No, please, I can explain.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 HELEN: You looked me right in the eye and you lied to me! You made your choice, John. You need his love more than mine.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: No, my choice is you. I was going to -- I love you.  No, please. Please, Helen. I love you and I want to spend my life with you and, and I can't live without you. Helen, so --  so, will you marry me?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Helen.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Henry! Henry!!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Please say something.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Henry!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Henry? Anybody here?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Is anybody here? Henry!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: You came back.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: What, did you think I was going to leave you here? Come on, can you stand?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: I don't -- I think so.  Thank you, Henry. Thank you for not leaving me.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: You're welcome, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: Hey, hey, Jack. Wait up. You heading up to the Hatch?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: Mind if I join? It's been a while since I had a shower and I was just hoping that...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Actually, the plumbing's busted.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: Busted?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Yeah, water's been running muddy. I guess we've got a cracked pipe but it's going to take some time to find it.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: Oh, well, I guess I wasted a trip, then.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Well, I'll let you know as soon as we get things worked out down there.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: Right.  I'm glad you beat Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: You know what? The Hatch can wait until morning -- if you'd like me to walk you back to the beach.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: Do you see that?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: It's a parachute.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: Wait.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 KATE: It's food.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 CHARLIE: What the bloody hell is that?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK:  What'd you find?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: I've got you, easy, easy.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: What did you do -- what did you do to end it -- to make the doors go up?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: I did what you told me to. I punched in the code and pressed the execute button, but nothing happened other than that clock flipping back. I was climbing back into the vent when the lights went out. 10 seconds later the doors went up. I didn't do anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: You think it was all just random?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Don't look at me; it's your hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK:  Get away from him.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Wait, you don't...
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAYID:  Step back, right now.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: Sayid, it's okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 JACK: I said, "get away"!
Lost.Season02.Episode17 LOCKE: I let him out -- some kind of lockdown or something -- he, he was helping me.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 GALE: Couldn't you find my balloon?
Lost.Season02.Episode17 ANA: Yeah, we found it.
Lost.Season02.Episode17 SAYID: We did find your balloon, Henry Gale, exactly how you described it. We also found the grave you described -- your wife's grave. The grave you said you dug with your own bare hands. It was all there. Your whole story -- your alibi -- it was true. But still I did not believe it to be true. So I dug up that grave and found that there was not a woman inside. There was a man.  A man named Henry Gale.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Isn't this nice?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I kind of prefer breathing.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Come on, you're doing great. You know, exercise is addictive.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Wow, I can -- I can see why.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I guess I need to drop a few pounds.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Don't be so hard on yourself. It's not going to happen overnight. Some people's metabolisms are just a little slower.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: It's not my metabolism. I'm sick.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: What? What's wrong?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Never mind. 
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Hurley, you can trust me.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Okay, but it's bad.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: When we first crashed here, I thought, this isn't all bad -- it's, like, the all mango diet. I wasn't turning any heads or nothing but I did drop a couple belt sizes. Then we found this hatch and it was full of food -- tons of food. I tried giving it all away, but I guess I kind of kept some of it for myself. I wish I could just get rid of it.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Then get rid of it.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: You want to change -- then change.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: How do you feel?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I feel free.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JIN: 뭘 찾았대! 뭘 찾았대!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SUN: They found something. Come on!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 Charlie: Risotto. Nice.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY:  Where did this come from?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JIN:  누가 여기다 떨어뜨렸나봐.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 CHARLIE: Locke said some kind of blast doors trapped him in the Hatch. Maybe it was because of this -- so no one would see who dropped it. Any of you guys see a plane last night?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: Yeah, I saw it, Tattoo. I just decided not to tell.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 REDSHIRT #1: Hey, give those back, man. Those are mine.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 REDSHIRT #2: No, man. I saw them first.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 REDSHIRT #1: No, you saw me put those in my box.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 REDSHIRT #2: No way.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 REDSHIRT #1: Give me my stuff, man!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: Hold on, take it easy. You guys are like locusts. How about a little order here?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 CHARLIE: Shouldn't we let someone a little more trustworthy take care of this?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: Like you, babynapper?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 CHARLIE: No, like Hurley. Why not Hurley? He's done it before, he can do it again.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: No. No way! Not me, no! Not again, no!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Okay, hey, hey, guys, guys, how about no one's in charge, okay? I'm sure everyone can manage to just take what they need.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: Great plan, Moonbeam. And after that we can sing "Kumbaya" and do trust falls.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 CHARLIE:  You don't have to be savages about it.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER:  We can do it anyway you want.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Hey! Hey!!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Uh-oh.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Hey. What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Who were you looking for out there?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: No one.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: When you ran off it sort of seemed like you were looking for someone. I tried to find you.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I kind of -- don't want to talk about it.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Sure, okay. Pretty weird, huh? So the Island won't let you lose weight -- you destroy your stash, then bang -- more food falls from the sky.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: How about that?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: I'm proud of you.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Proud of me for what?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Not freaking out.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: How's the diet coming, Hugo?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: It's okay. I had a salad and some chicken breast for lunch.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: That's great. It gets easier, I promise. So I heard you had a visit with your mom. How did that go?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: It was good.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: You're not still mad at her, then?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Nah. I know she put me in here for a reason.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: What reason was that?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: The accident.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: You want to talk about that today?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Do we have to?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Hugo, you've been in here almost 2 months, now. Don't you think it's time to start getting our hands dirty?  Okay, why don't we talk about the little homework assignment that I gave you?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I was never really good at homework.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: You remember what you were supposed to do -- just make a list of things you like about yourself?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Nobody else did it.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Nobody else -- meaning -- ?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Well, Dave didn't do it. He said it was a stupid idea.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Well, you know, I'm not Dave's doctor, but we have talked about how he could be a very negative influence.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Dave's the most normal person in this place, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: But he doesn't want you to change, does he?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Dude, dude, I'm open, dude!  It's called dribbling, not drooling -- dribbling. Well, shoot it then! Shoot it!  Wait -- oh, high percentage shot, excellent choice.  Do you want in the game, man? Go for it. Something tells me no one will care.  What's the matter with you?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE:  Dude, dude, give up the rock!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Fantastic, give it to the guy who's  not even in the game!!  Hey, it's taco night, dude, let's blow this pop stand.  What?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Brooks said you're, like, negative.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Well, duh. So what, you don't want to hang out with me anymore?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Nah, I don't know, it's just...
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Is that quack getting inside your head, man? Do not let him. You've got much more important things to think about.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Like what?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Like hard or soft shell, baby -- chicken or shrimp -- sour cream or hot sauce.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Yeah, I guess I could eat.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Yeah, I thought so -- noche de tacos, amigo.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JACK: Good. Now, can you do the other one?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: Is it broken?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JACK: Without an x-ray, you're just going to have to do with my best guess.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JACK: Sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 KATE:  How are you holding up?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: Depends on Jack's best guess.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JACK:  There's a small fracture -- probably hairline. This will keep the swelling down until I can get a splint on it.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: How long 'til I can walk on it?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JACK: You're going to have to keep off it a couple of weeks. There's a wheelchair back at camp...
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: No! -- I don't need a wheelchair.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 KATE: We took a pair of crutches from the fuselage when we moved down the beach.  Okay. I'll be back in a while.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: He could have escaped.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JACK: Sorry?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: Henry -- during the lockdown -- I was hurt. He could have escaped.  But he came back to help me, why would he do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JACK: He didn't come back to help you, John. He came back because he thought his story was going to check out.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: He was dead already.  4 months ago I was part of the search party. Henry Gale was hanging out of the basket -- neck broken.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID:  So he was already dead?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID: Then you buried him and left a grave marker?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID:  You really should have checked his wallet before you did that. I assume Henry Gale did not have any paper on which to compose his thoughts, so he had to improvise. There wasn't much space for that.  "Jennifer, well, you were right. Crossing the Pacific isn't easy. I owe you a beer. I'm hiking to one of the beaches to start a signal fire. But if you're reading this I guess I didn't make it. I'm sorry. I love you, Jenny. Always have -- always will. Yours, Henry." So tell me, how did Henry Gale write a note to his wife with a broken neck?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE:  It wasn't me. I didn't kill him. You don't understand.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID: How did you know his wife's name? Did you interrogate him?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: Please, just listen. I'm just a --
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID: How many of you are there?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: If I told you about them -- you have no idea what he'll do.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID: He?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 ANA: You mean their leader -- the guy with the beard.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: Him?! He's no one! Nothing!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID: Where are your people?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: I can't...
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID: How many of you are there?!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: You don't understand!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID:  Understand this --
Lost.Season02.Episode18 ANA: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID: You have 3 seconds to answer my question. How many of you are there? 1 --
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: He'll kill me!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID: I'll kill you.  2...
Lost.Season02.Episode18 ANA: Sayid!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: You can't do this! I am not a bad person!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID: 3.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 ANA: What the hell is wrong with you?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE:  What's going on?! I heard a gun shot!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JACK:  What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAYID: He's a liar!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 ANA:  It's fine, just get him out of here.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: Jack! Jack! Jack!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JACK:  I've got it covered, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE:  Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 ANA: Shut up.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 CHARLIE: Hey, I noticed you were building something. I thought maybe you could use this -- for whatever it is.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 EKO: That's very thoughtful of you, Charlie. Why don't you help me?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 CHARLIE: What are you making?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 EKO:  Hold that end.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 CHARLIE: Is it a Starbucks?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 EKO: Help me carry one of those logs, please.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 CHARLIE: Are you going to tell me?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 EKO: Not right now.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: You're not here!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Hey, wait!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Wait, Dave!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 CHARLIE: Are you okay, Hurley?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Did either of you see a guy run through here -- in a bathrobe, with a coconut?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 CHARLIE: No. Saw a polar bear on roller blades with a mango.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 EKO: I did not see anything, Hurley.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY:  Yeah, me either.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LENNY: 4, 8, 15... 
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Uh, dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Pretty sneaky, Leonard.  You're using those magic numbers of yours as a psyche-out, are you man? Oh, yeah, that's right, you just play dumb. I'm on to your juju, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY:  They're just numbers, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE:  Hey. What the hell is that?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: It's my mid-afternoon snack.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Dude, that's celery. Celery is not a snack. Leonard's got graham crackers, man. You should snag one. He won't notice. What's he going to do -- call you a 23?  4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, hike!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 NURSE: Here, Hugo. Here's your meds.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Thank you, nurse Lazenby.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Dude, you want to get out of here with me? Don't take the horse tranquilizer.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: What do mean, get out of here?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: I mean escape, man. Me and you, A-S-A-P. They're getting to you, dude. We've got to split.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Dr. Brooks says...
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Dr. Brooks does not care about you, man. He's the one prescribing that crap. What the hell is it, anyway?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Clonazepam.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS:  Hugo, something wrong with your meds, there?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: No, me and Dave were just, you know, talking about stuff.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Right, well, sorry to interrupt. Hello there, Dave.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Hello there, Dr. Brooks.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: And how are you today?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Never been saner.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: I've been taking some pictures for the bulletin board. I've got everyone except you 2. Would you guys mind?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Okay. Why don't you two get a little bit closer.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Are you going to make us look at the ducky, too?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS:  Say cheese.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Cheese.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Queso.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Great. Okay, you -- you need a little water with that?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Nope, I'm good.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Okay, well fine. See you later guys, thanks for the photo op.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: The revolution has begun, man. Lay low -- when the time is right we fly.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY:  You've got to twist it to get the frosting. Pulling it will only break the cookie.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: Well, that's what I get for not going to the expert in the first place. What can I do you for, Deepdish?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I'm kind of looking for something.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: Forget it. I'm done trading. I got enough food now to open a chain of mini-marts. Hey, you think Sayid needs a job?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Well, actually, I was sort of hoping you'd do me a favor. Remember when I helped you out with that tree frog -- that you killed?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: Yeah, I remember.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I sort of -- need some medicine.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: What do you need?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: It's called Clonazepam.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: Clonaza -- what? What the hell's that?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: So you can calm down. Or, for when you're seeing things that aren't supposed to be there.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: What stuff you seeing?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I don't know, maybe like a bald guy in a bathrobe.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: You mean like that guy there?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER:  Gotcha.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: What the hell are you doing? Get off of me.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Who the hell do you think you are?!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER:  Let go of me.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SUN: 뭐야?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY:  Pork Rinds! Barbar! Jabba! Stay Puft!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SUN: 어우 안되겠다, 가서 도와줘요.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY:  Mongo! Lardo!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: Let go of me. Get him off me.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SUN: 도와 줘요!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JIN: 이제 그만 해!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: What the hell's the matter with you? Get off me.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: What the hell's the matter with you?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 JIN: 그만 해.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: You're crazy!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I'm not crazy. -- I'm not crazy.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 KATE:  So, he just attacked you, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: Try to contain yourself, Freckles.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 KATE: What? I'm -- I'm worried. You look like you got your ass kicked.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: Don't you got an adventure to get to? I think Timmy fell down a well over that way.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 KATE: Seriously though, why would Hurley of all people...?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: I've got no idea. I didn't do nothing. He just Hulked-out on me.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 KATE: For no reason at all?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 SAWYER: Okay, you walk off and have yourself a nice long giggle. But steer clear -- the man is crazy.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Hurley? Hey, are you okay? What happened with Sawyer?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I don't want to talk about it.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: So, you beat him up?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I guess you know what happened, then.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: I'm on your side, whatever you tell me...
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I don't want to talk, okay!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: That's a lot of peanut butter.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Well, I'm going to need a lot of protein where I'm going.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Where are you going?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Back to the caves. No one lives there anymore, so I won't bother anybody. I'm just going to live alone and be one of those guys -- you know, the crazy guys -- with a big beard and no clothes who's naked and throws doodie at people.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Hurley, you don't have to do this.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Just leave me alone. You can't help me. No one can.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: You're not here. You were in the hospital. You can't be here.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Sorry, dude. I am here.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I like that I have a good relationship with my mom. I like making my grandpa, Tito, laugh. I like chicken.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Well, that last one wasn't about you, Hugo.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I like that I like chicken?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: So, tell me, how did it feel writing that? Was that difficult?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Kind of -- I think I messed up some spelling.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: I notice that you didn't say anything about the way you look. Are you comfortable with your appearance?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: It's not like... I can't really do anything about it, right?  If I, uh -- if I w -- wasn't so fat, they never would have died.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: There were 23 people on that deck. It was built to hold 8. And it would have collapsed whether you went out there or not.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Yeah, but I did walk out there. And it did collapse. I killed them.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: It was an accident.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: That was my fault.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Look, after those people died, you were in a practically catatonic state. You stopped talking, you stopped going out, you stopped sleeping. But you never stopped eating because that's how you punish yourself.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Dave's right about you. You know, you're nothing but a quack.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Dave doesn't want you to lose weight, does he?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: You know, Dave cares about me. He's my friend.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Let me show you something.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: It may upset you. This is the photo I took for the bulletin board.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Dave isn't your friend, Hugo, because Dave doesn't exist.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Psst. Hey, wake up, dude. Finally, you could sleep through a damn NASCAR race, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Wait, you're not -- you're a hallucination.  Ow.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Was that a hallucination?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Maybe I just imagined you slapped me?  Ow! Damn it.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: We can do this all night.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Dr. Brooks showed me a picture from the rec room. My arm was around, like, nothingness.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Uh, Kinko's, Photoshop? What, you think they really blew up the Death Star?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Then stop talking crazy, man. Come on, we're on a clock here.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Hey, you in or you out, dude?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Okay, come on, come on.  Yo, check it out, Marcus didn't finish his lasagna. That is a waste, man. One for the road?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Shhh. Wait for it -- wait.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Tippy-toes, big guy. Vámonos.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Okay, man. You've got the keys, hombre. You took them off Brooks' desk earlier.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE:  Come on, man. Open it, open it.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Oh, oh, oh -- can you taste that? That is freedom, baby. You know what tastes even better than freedom? Cheeseburgers.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE:  Come on, man, chili-fries on me. 
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I don't think I can do this. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Sorry? What, are you kidding me?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: You're not real. You're trying to get me to run away and get cheeseburgers because I want cheeseburgers.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Did you take those pills, man?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: No, man. I'm just not coming. Look, you don't want me to get better. You don't want me to change.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: You don't need to change, man. You are fine. You're great.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: No, I'm not. You just want me to stay fat. You don't want me to get better. You wouldn't care if I ate myself to death.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Do not do this, man. If you don't come with me right now, you will never get out of here.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Bye, Dave.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: You wouldn't happen to have my slipper, would you?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Thank you. Oh, man, you got peanut butter on it. Okay, look, I know you're freaking out right now, and I'm, I'm sorry. But it's going to get a little worse before it gets better.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Worse?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Yeah, kind of. You ready, dude?  You remember that night you closed that window on me?  You remember what you did after that night?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Yeah, I realized you were imaginary.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Mmmmhmmm.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: And that was a breakthrough. And a little while later Brooks let me out, and I went home to live with my mom, and I got my job at Mr. Clucks back. And I got better.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Okay, good, great, yeah -- except see, here's the thing -- uh -- none of that ever happened.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: You're still at Santa Rosa, man. You never left the hospital.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: That's -- not possible.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: It's hard, I know, but I mean -- all this? You, me, this island, that peanut butter -- none of it's real, man. None of it's happening. It's all in your head, my friend. The second you closed that window your brain popped a gasket. You went back into your little coma thing. And that's where you are right this very second. In your own private Idaho, inside Santa Rosa.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: No. I had my mom, my friend Johnny -- I won the lottery.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Whoa, wow, awesome, dude! What numbers did you play? Leonard's numbers, right -- from the hospital? What a coincidence. You, uh, seen them around anywhere else?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: The Hatch?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Bingo! The Hatch -- with the button that you've got to push every 108 minutes or the world ends. Oh, oh, oh, and what's the code for the button? Oh yeah, the Numbers.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: But I got better. I changed.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Changed? What, are you kidding me? Take a look at yourself. You've been on a deserted island for over 2 months and you haven't dropped 10 pounds. How is that even possible, man?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I just destroyed my stash, and I've been exercising. Libby says it won't happen over night.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Oh, right, right, right, Libby -- the mega cute blonde chick who magically appeared from the other side of the Island. Oh, oh, oh, yeah -- and who just happens to have the hots for you. Come on, man, let's take a walk.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: So this is all in my brain?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Every rock, every tree. Every tree frog. Even me. The real me -- the one they told you was imaginary? He went out the window, man. Right now he's probably bouncing from hot chick to hot chick, unlike me, who's really you, who's got more important things to do.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: So I'm making you up?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Well, sort of. I'm part of your subconscious, man. All the people on this island are.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: What part of me are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: I'm the part of you that wants to wake up, man. Follow me.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: This is it, dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: It?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: The big finale. The answer to all your problems. A way for you to wake up, snap out of it.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I don't want to kill myself.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: Who said anything about killing yourself, man? This is going to bring you back to life. The only way for you to bust out is to tell your mind that you don't believe any of this.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: So, if I -- all this will be gone? I'll just wake up?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DAVE: That's right. And when you do wake up, come find me. I'm sure I miss you. See you in another life, Hurley.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Dave!!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: Jack not back yet?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 ANA: Nope. He's telling everyone at the beach that we've got one of them. Something tells me people have a lot of questions about our houseguest.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: I want to talk to him.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 ANA: I don't think that's on today's program.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: Well, all due respect, Ana Lucia, but I don't care what you think.  5 minutes. I earned 5 minutes with him.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: What's your name -- your real name?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: Why don't you just keep calling me Henry? I've gotten used to it.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: Did you get caught on purpose? You and your people have been here for God knows how long, and you got caught in a net...
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: God doesn't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: God doesn't know how long we've been here, John. He can't see this island any better than the rest of the world can. May I ask you a question? What possible reason could I have for putting myself through all this?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: Maybe your people were looking for this place.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: This place? This place is a joke, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: I crawled through your vents and I stood at your computer as the alarm beeped. And you know what happened? The timer went all the way down to zero, and then some funny red pictures flipped up in its place. They looked like hieroglyphics, but I'm no expert. And then things got real interesting. There was a loud clunking and a hum like a magnet -- a big magnet. It was really very frightening. And you know what happened next? Nothing happened, John. Nothing happened at all. Your timer just flipped back to 108. I never entered the numbers. I never pressed the button.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LOCKE: You're lying.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 GALE: No, I'm done lying.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Dave!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY:  Who's Dave?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: How'd you know where I was?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Jin saw you while he was fishing.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Hah! Jin doesn't speak English!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Sun was with him. She translated. Hurley, what is going on?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: No! You're just a part of me that's scared. You don't want me to wake up. Well, guess what? I'm not scared.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Okay, okay, Hurley, you're having some sort of panic attack. I get that. But this isn't like you.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Like me? You don't know me.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: I was starting to.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Yeah, well did you know I'm so fat that I killed 2 people? And that I have an imaginary friend?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Hurley, please, you're going to hurt yourself.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: No, I'm not, because this isn't happening! None of it! I'm just imagining it! This isn't real life!
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Why would you say that?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Because in real life -- no girl like you would ever like me. Remember when I said I knew you from somewhere? Well, maybe it's because I made you up?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: What was the man's name who broke his leg? The day of the crash on the other side of the Island, Eko brought a man with a broken leg to me for help. What was his name?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: I don't know.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: You don't know. You know why? Because it happened to me. His name was Donald, and I buried him. I buried a lot of people, Hurley. So don't tell me that that wasn't real. And don't tell me you made me up. It's insulting.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: When you saw me on the beach this morning was I holding a slipper?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Not that I can remember, no.  Hurley, look at me. I am real. You're real. The way I feel about you -- that's real.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: And that was real.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Maybe you should do it one more time just to be sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Ready to go back?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Do you really think I can, you know, change?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 LIBBY: Yeah, yeah I do.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Why don't you get a little closer together.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Say cheese.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Cheese.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: Great. So, you need some water to go with that?
Lost.Season02.Episode18 HURLEY: Nope. I'm good.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 DR. BROOKS: See you later, guys. Thanks for the photo op.
Lost.Season02.Episode18 NURSE: Here's your pill, Libby.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Cereal goes on the left, Bernard.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: So this isn't bothering you at all?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: What's "this"?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD:  Well, this  this...
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Why would a bag of potato chips bother me?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Aren't you remotely curious as to where all this came from? You're acting like we just got back from the supermarket.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Well, I guess I was raised never to question my blessings.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: I was raised to question piles of food with weird labels that just fall out of the sky, Rose.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Well, honey just because you're having a bad day doesn't mean you have to raise your voice.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Bad day? I had 7 weeks of bad days on the other side of the island just trying to stay alive so I could get back to you. Here -- my God, Rose -- they've built a kitchen on the beach. They've given up.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Given up? On what?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: On getting rescued.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK:  Hey, you going to get that?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK:  When's the last time you went in to see him?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ANA: A couple of hours ago. He was sleeping.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Did he eat?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ANA: No. It's 2 days now. No food. No water. Nothing to say.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: I don't know about you but I'm tired of waiting.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK:  I hear you've lost your appetite.  Okay, don't talk. I was never that good at bedside manner anyway. I'm going to change that dressing on your shoulder. If you try anything, we've got a problem.  So, Henry  -- Henry. I was thinking about something you were saying before we found out who you are. This is going to sting.  Yeah, you were saying that if you were one of them that you'd lead us into a trap, capture our people, force a trade -- us for you. Pretty good idea, Henry. And, since you are one of them, I thought now might be a good time to use it. I'm going out to the line we're not supposed to cross and telling them that we've got you. And if they want you back, it's going to cost them. And when we get Walt back you might just have been worth all the trouble.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Did you say something?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 GALE: They'll never give you Walt.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD:  Don't gun it. You're digging yourself in. Just tap the gas lightly.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE:  With all due respect, I have been driving in snow my whole life. You mind stepping back?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Well, you have to rock it out. You're not going to be able...
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: I'm calling AAA.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Why, so they can send a tow truck? Trust me, I can do this.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Okay, ease on the gas. That's it. You're doing great. Almost. Go, go, go.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Are you okay?!
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Oh, yeah, sure. I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: You know, I would have gotten it out eventually.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Oh, sure. July's right around the corner.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE:  Well, thanks for helping me.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: By the way, I'm Rose.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Oh, uh, Bernard.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Oh, okay, yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Drive safe now, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Yeah, you too.  Uh, um, Bernard!
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Yeah?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Coffee would be nice. Yeah, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: I had to beat back half the group to get these. I saved them for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 HURLEY: No way. I'm on a new diet. Nothing but fish and water; and fish and water.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Hurley, what are you doing, right now?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 HURLEY: Talking to your wife.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Good. Can you get Libby and meet me at the edge of the tree line in 5 minutes? Oh, and if you can get Jin and Sun, Jenkins and that Frogurt guy -- the guy who used to make frozen yogurt.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 HURLEY: Neil?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Yeah, and Craig -- anybody else you can get.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Bernard? What are you up to?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: I got an idea.  Hey, Richard, Craig, Jerome come here.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ANA: I'm not so sure trading people's their thing.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Well, talking to him is getting us nowhere, so -- I think we can get something for him.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ANA: You want me to come with you?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK:  You need to stay here.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ANA:  You need it more than I do. Do yourself a favor, man. Don't go out there alone.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Alright.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 SAWYER: Ah, that's how it's done.  Aw, well look at you. That's like 4 in the last half hour. Let me call the Guinness Book.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: You want help or not? Because I've got better things to do with my time.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 SAWYER:  Oh happy day, here comes Dr. Giggles.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 SAWYER: Hey, yourself.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: I'm going back out into the jungle to talk to our friend with the beard -- see if we can make a trade.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 SAWYER: Ah, the old prisoner exchange. And you're inviting me along because you want a gun, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: I'm not inviting you; I'm inviting Kate. And I've already got a gun, but thanks for offering.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 SAWYER: How the hell did you get a gun?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Does it matter?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: I'll get my things.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Okay, 2 months we've been on this island -- 2 months. And already we have a water trough, and we've got a food pantry. And people are taking showers in your hatch. Have you forgotten that we all crashed on this island? It's like none of you want to go home again.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 CLAIRE: How can you say that? Of course we want to go home.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Well, then why aren't we doing anything about it?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 HURLEY: Dude, we, like, built a raft. But it got blown up.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Okay, so what are we doing now? That pallet of food had a parachute which means a plane dropped it here which means there are other planes that fly over the island. So, we are going to build a sign -- a massive sign along the beach. So that way if a plane flies over or a satellite takes pictures from up there -- we want to make damn sure that they know we're here -- that they know about us.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Maybe we should speak to Jack about this first.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Well, do we have to run everything by Jack? I mean, he's not the president. He's a doctor.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: You're a dentist.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Could I speak to you for just a second? Come here.  Honey, it is just a sign. I don't see what the harm is.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: The harm is you are telling these people about airplanes and satellites coming out of nowhere to save the day.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: I'm just trying to do something. I want to get back to our life.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Well, the only thing you are doing is giving these people false hope.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD:  Excuse me; I have a sign to build.  Alright, I want to get this going right away. We've waited long enough.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 .
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: It's just amazing, isn't it?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD:  Oh, sure, it's beautiful.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: You're not impressed, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: So, what does God have to do to get your attention?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Bernard, what are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Rose, I've been a bachelor for 56 years, and then I met you. And we just fell into this rhythm like we had known each other forever. I always dreamed of finding somebody like you, but I'd given up hope that I ever would.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Bernard...
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: I know, I know. It's crazy. We just met 5 months ago. But 5 months is long enough because I knew after 5 minutes.  Rose, I love you. Will you marry me?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Bernard, I'm dying. I'm sick, and I'm dying.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD:  Would you excuse us for a minute, please? 
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: I've been in remission for the last couple of years. But now it's back and this time it's not going away. My doctor says I have about a year -- maybe a little longer.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD:  You haven't answered my question.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Are you sure?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Oh, I'm sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Yes. Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Boy, you bunk with a guy for 48 days -- now he doesn't call or write.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 EKO: Hello, Bernard.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: What have you boys got going up here?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 EKO: Just working.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Listen, I've got a whole team of folks throwing together a big sign down along the beach. Hopefully, it'll get spotted by a plane or a satellite. We could sure use all the bodies we could get to help put it together.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 EKO: Sorry, I'm busy.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Charlie?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 CHARLIE: Ah, regrets, Bernard, I've only got 2 hands, you know. Good luck, though.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Well, could I at least grab some of these logs? We could use them...
Lost.Season02.Episode19 EKO: We're using them.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: For what, exactly?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 CHARLIE: A church.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: A church?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 EKO: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Everybody on this island is building something. I'm trying to get us saved.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 EKO: People are saved in different ways, Bernard.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: I think I liked you better when you just hit people with your stick. 
Lost.Season02.Episode19 CHARLIE: I like you just the way you are.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE:  I need to talk to him.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ANA: The gun's with Jack. The door stays closed. But if you want to talk to him -- talk to him.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE:  Henry, can you hear me?  It's John, Henry. Henry, did you enter the numbers? Did you push the button, or not? Henry, I need to know. I want you to answer me. Answer me! Answer me, Henry!
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: What happened to everybody? Where's Craig? Where's Frogurt?  Okay, alright, moving on. We're going to put this sign across this entire beach which means the letters have to be really big -- about 40 feet. These black rocks will get maximum contrast with the sand.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 HURLEY: Dude, we're, like, going to need a lot more rocks.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Yes, Hurley, we're going to need a lot more rocks. There's a lava field about a half mile inland that's loaded with them. We're going to haul them out in 2 man teams. So, you guys double up, and I am going to start sketching out the letters in the sand. Let's do this.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 HURLEY: Hey, um, I can sketch the letters.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Everybody's got a job, Hurley. I do my job, you do yours.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JIN: 결국 힘든 일은 우리가 다 하는 거지?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: What? What'd he say?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 HURLEY: I think he's not so crazy about the whole carry the rocks a half mile thing.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Okay, this is going to take time. But if this is the thing that gets us off this place, isn't that worth it?  Rome wasn't built in a day, you know. No, you don't know. Alright, let's get started. Come on.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: We're lost.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: You saying we're lost doesn't make us lost, sweetheart. I know exactly where we are.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Me too. Driving around in circles in the middle of the Outback. That's why I wanted to be on a beach for our honeymoon.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Thank goodness, civilization. Bernard, let's get directions.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Oh, I don't need directions. I told you, honey, we're not lost.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Bernard, what's going on?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD:  I brought you out here because I want you to see this man. His name is Isaac of Uluru. He's helped hundreds of people. Now, I know how it looks, but believe me he's completely legit.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Bernard, you brought me to a faith healer?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: He's the real deal, Rose. When I started telling people about your situation I got 3 separate calls recommending him.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: My situation? This is why you wanted to come to Australia? To bring me to some kind of a kook?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: No, he's not. Rose, I made a 10,000 dollar donation just to get you in to see him. Normally...
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE:  I didn't ask for this! This is -- Bernard, I have made my peace with what is happening to me.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Well, I haven't. I can't just do nothing, Rose. That's not me. That's not who I am. I have to try. Will you try, Rose? For me.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: If you have time to fix your hut you have time to move some rocks. Come on, we could really use your help.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 SAWYER: What, you got union trouble down at the sand factory, Norma Rae?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Come on, Sawyer, I need your help. What do you say?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 SAWYER: I say Pasadena.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Well, I hope you're happy.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: About what?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: This morning I had 15 people willing to work on the sign, now I'm down to 4.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: How is that my fault?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: At the very least I expected your support. You had to go and attack me.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Have you ever stopped to think maybe the reason people are quitting is because you've got yourself a management problem?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: What is the matter with you, Rose? I am just trying to do something.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: That's right. You're always trying to do. Why can't you just let things be?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: If I didn't always have to do something you wouldn't be here.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: I'm flattered.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Yeah, why is that?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Because you chose me to go with you instead of Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: I asked Sayid first but he turned me down. And I only asked you because they don't want you. They grabbed you -- had you at gunpoint. They could have kept you but they didn't. Then again, they didn't really want me, either.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Damaged goods, both of us.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: What's that?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Kate?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: It's a doll. 
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK:  Wait, wait, no. No don't.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: You okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Oh good, so you can hear me? This isn't one of theirs.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: No, it's not sophisticated enough. It must be one of Rousseau's traps, so hopefully she's not far from here.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: It could be a week before she shows up.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: I'm trying to get the gun. I can't get my arm around.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE:  Alright. Sorry. I don't want to shoot you. Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: You got it?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Okay, ready? Got it, got it, got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Oh, alright. Okay, now give me the gun.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Why, what for?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: I'm going to try to shoot the rope.  Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: I'm a better shot than you are.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Oh, really?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Yeah, I told you. I grew up hunting with my dad.  Damn!
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Well, at least they know where we are. Okay, now give me the gun.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Are you going to waste another bullet?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK:  We'll still have 13 more to shoot each other with. Come on.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Fine. You have a better angle than mine anyway.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Oh, that's going to be your excuse when I make the shot?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: When you make the shot.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Nice shot.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: No, no, no, no. You're doing it all wrong. I told you 3 rows -- 3 so they can see it from the air.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JIN:  시키는 대로 하고 있잖아요!
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: 3 rows! How hard is that?!
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JIN: 누굴 바보로 아나? 나도 쓰리 정도는 알아요!
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Do I just have to do everything myself?!
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JIN: 직접 하실래요? 해보시지! 
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: No, no, no. No, Jin. No, wait. Please, I just want to get my wife home. Rose. I want to get Rose home.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JIN: Sorry. 
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: You're in my spot.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE: I can move.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Can you?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE: Oh, that's funny.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: I guess your sense of humor got trapped under that blast door with your leg.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE: I saw your husband walking through the jungle hauling rocks.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: He's building a big sign in the sand so the satellites will see it. That man doesn't know the difference between an errand and a fool's errand.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE: Well, Rose, most of us don't.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: So, what are you doing down here, John? Can't remember the last time I saw you out of that hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE: I'm done with the hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Oh, now you're just frustrated. You'll be out of that splint and running around the island again in no time.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE: And yet, Jack said it would be at least 4 weeks.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: But, honey, you and I both know it's not going to take that long.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 AUSSIE WOMAN: Right this way, Rose. Please, make yourself comfortable. Isaac will be right with you.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ISAAC: You must be Rose. Why don't you have a seat.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: So, um, how does this work? I sit here and you chant, pray, or what?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ISAAC: There are certain places with great energy -- spots on the Earth like the one we're above now. Perhaps this energy is geological -- magnetic. Or perhaps it's something else. And when possible I harness this energy and give it to others. May I?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: What? What, what is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ISAAC: I'm sorry. I can't do anything for you, Rose.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: I didn't expect you to. 
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ISAAC: It's not that you can't be healed. Like I said, there's different energies. This is not the right place for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Where is the right place?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ISAAC: I wish I knew. I'll return your husband's donation.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Don't. I'm going to tell him you fixed me. I'm going to tell him you fixed me.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: What did you mean back there?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: In the net -- you said they were sophisticated, the Others.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Uh, last week when the baby got sick, Claire and I went into the jungle and, uh, found another hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: It's a medical station. There's nothing you can use; it was all cleared out, but I found some lockers. They had clothes inside -- all worn and dirty. And they were on hangers like costumes, you know. And there was a make-up kit, and a fake beard.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: When were you going to tell me this?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: When you decided to let me back in the club.  What, you can keep one of them locked up in the hatch for like a week and say nothing, but then when I...
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: We're here.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Are you sure?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK:  That's where they took a shot at Sawyer. Right over there was where they pushed you out of the jungle with the bag on your head. And right there is where I laid my guns down.  Hey, hey I'm back! You say you're watching us -- you hear me? We've got your man! If you want him back you're going to have to come out here! Come on out!
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Jack!
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: I know you're out there! I know you can hear me!
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Jack, they're not here.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: I'll be right here 'til you talk to me! I'll be right here!
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: I brought you some supper.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Thanks, you can just set it down there.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Where is everybody?  I owe you an apology.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: You don't have anything to be sorry for. It's my own damn fault I'm out here by myself.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: That's not why I'm apologizing. I lied to you. Back in Australia, Isaac -- he didn't heal me. He didn't do anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Of course he did.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Bernard, he didn't heal me. But that doesn't mean I'm not healed.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: When you're sick and you have got something inside you that doesn't belong there you can feel it.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: And after the crash I couldn't feel it anymore. At first I thought it was just shock.
Lost.Season02.Episode19  But it wasn't. It's this place.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: But you said Isaac fixed you.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: I told you that so that you wouldn't spend what time we had left trying to do something.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: Rose, you could just be in remission. How do you know it wasn't Isaac who healed you?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Bernard.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: How do you know that he didn't heal you?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: I know. I know.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE: These yours?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE: You're welcome.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ROSE: Trust me. I know.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: You don't want to be rescued, do you? You think if you leave it'll come back. And if you can't leave, neither can I. We won't ever leave Rose.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 BERNARD: I would offer to take down the sign, but we didn't get very far.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ANA: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE: Hi.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ANA: I pressed your button.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE: It's not my button.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 ANA: Where did you go?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 LOCKE: I just needed to stretch my legs.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: How long are you going to wait, Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: Until I get my voice back. Then I'm going to yell some more.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Maybe they can't hear you.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: They can hear me.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: I'm sorry I kissed you.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 JACK: I'm not.
Lost.Season02.Episode19 KATE: Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 KATE: Michael, Michael. What's wrong with him? Michael. Michael?  Jack, where are you going?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Maybe they just let him go?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 KATE: Let him go? He's alone. They didn't just push him out into the jungle, Jack! He's alone!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Okay, let's go.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 PARTNER:  See ya, Ana Lucia.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CAPTAIN: You look tired.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Yeah, thanks. What?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CAPTAIN: Where were you last night?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Home.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CAPTAIN: All night?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Yeah, cooked myself some dinner, watched some TV.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CAPTAIN: What'd you watch?  Let's go for a drive.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CAPTAIN: Remember Jason McCormack? Found him in a parking lot just after three in the morning. He was dead an hour before anyone saw him. Crime scene pulled a gun from the dumpster -- registration was filed off, no prints, no witnesses. He was executed.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Any idea who did it?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CAPTAIN: Yeah, Ana, you did. This man confesses to shooting you in cold blood, and you refuse to ID him, so we had to cut him loose. A week later he shows up with five bullets in his chest because you shot him in cold blood.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Guess I should get a lawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CAPTAIN: Look, we both know that this is going to be a dead-end investigation. But, Ana, if you did this -- if you did this -- you have to let me help you.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Yeah, thanks, mom; but I don't need your help.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CAPTAIN: You don't want my help; you're going to have to get it from somewhere else. You're a police officer, Ana. If you don't respect me, at least respect that.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA:  Then I quit.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Hey, Henry, what do you say? How long are you going to keep up this hunger strike, Henry? I ever tell you I was a cop? I've been around a lot of killers in my life. You know what surprises me most about them? How much they love to talk. But you're different, Henry. Hmm? Quiet.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: 
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: What was that?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: 
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA:  If you're going to say something; you're going to have to speak up.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: You killed two of us -- good people who were leaving you alone. You're the killer, Ana Lucia.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: I guess he decided to start talking, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Hey, Mike, tequila-tonic.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: Long day, huh?  Good to see you again. You, uh, wanded me at security.  Another one, please.  So, how does one get into wanding?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: One stops being a cop.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: What a coincidence, I just stopped being a doctor.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Why'd you quit?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: I didn't. My son ratted me out for drinking on the job.  Thank you.  Lost my license.  Yeah, I know, it's hilarious.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: No, no, it's just that I don't think parents and their kids should work together -- too many issues.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: I'll drink to that.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: So, where you headed?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: Sydney. Sydney, Australia. You want to come? I'm serious.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Why would I go to Sydney with you?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: Maybe fate has just thrown the two of us together, you know. Two drinks in an airport bar --
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Why would fate do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: Same reason fate does anything -- so that we can help each other out. You do need help, right? Unless you don't. What I'm doing down there could be a little dangerous and I need someone to protect me -- a bodyguard. It's perfect for someone who stopped being a cop.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: I don't even know your name.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: Oh, let's not use real names. I'll tell you what -- why don't you pick a name for me and then I'll pick one for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: You look like a Tom.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: Tom, what an excellent name. And you should be a -- Sarah. Australia.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: I cut myself shaving.  The guy in the hatch tried to kill me.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: You okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: I'm fine; but he won't be.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: Hey, Ana?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: Don't do anything stupid.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: If you've come to apologize, I forgive for hitting me with your crutch. I'm so glad my head didn't break it.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: Now that's a broad question.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: Why'd you try to hurt Ana Lucia, but not me?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: I'm not sure I know what you're getting at, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: I was trapped under that blast door, helpless. You could've crushed my skull, but you didn't do a thing. Why didn't you?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: Because you're one of the good ones, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: What? Good what?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: None of this matters. I'm dead anyway. The doctor's gone to make a trade and we both know he'll come back empty-handed and then I've lost my value. So either Jack comes back here and kills me or my people find out where I'm being held and they do it.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: Why would your own people want to kill you?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: Because the man in charge -- he's a great man, John, a brilliant man -- but he's not a forgiving man. He'll kill me because I failed, John. I failed my mission.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: What mission?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: When that woman caught me in her trap I was on my way here, John. I was coming for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 KATE:  Locke!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Locke, get out here! Locke! Locke!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 KATE: John!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: Hey, I've been knocking those things down for 20 minutes. Get your hands off of my damn mangoes.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: I didn't figure you for the fruit picking type.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: What do you want?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: I need a gun.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: Well, here's an idea -- why not go to your buddy, Jack? He's got himself a gun. Oh, that's right, he's still traipsing around the jungle with Kate.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: If you've got a problem because he's making time with your girlfriend, don't take it out on me, man. How about you just give me a gun?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: Here's another idea -- scram. You heard me, now git.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: Sarah. Sarah, open the damn door.  Good, you're up. It's time -- protection duty. Come on, let's go.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: After four days of drinking and doing nothing -- now, in the middle of the night, you're ready to go?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: That's exactly right. It's time, come on. Fate's calling, Sarah.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: This is it, pull over right here.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: This is what you needed protection for -- the suburbs?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: Stay in the car.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Should I keep the meter running?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN:  I just want to see my daughter.  She's my daughter and I have every right to see her!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LINDSEY: No, you don't have a right! Now get out!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: I pay the mortgage on this house... I want to see my daughter!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: What the hell is wrong with you?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LINDSEY: Don't you ever come back here!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: I was just having a conversation with the lady.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LINDSEY: You need help!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: Dude, nice hole.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAYID: What is it, Hurley?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: Hey, man, remember that radio we made? I'm thinking maybe I could get it to play some music. You know, for Libby.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAYID: Well, it worked only once and then just for a minute. I've tried several times since and only gotten static.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: Here's the thing -- even that would be good -- because then Libby would be like, "it's the thought that counts" -- and I'll score major points. Especially when she sees me holding it over my head.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAYID: And why would you hold a static generating radio over your head?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: They didn't have "Say Anything" in Baghdad? It's awesome. This dude, like, gets his boom box and he holds it over his head outside this chick's window and he plays some Peter Gabriel song for her and bam, the girl's, like, his. I mean, after her dad goes to jail. But then he gets her.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAYID: I think I get the idea.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: You should really check it out sometime. I mean, if we ever, you know, get off this island.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAYID: If you want to do something nice for Libby, there's a beautiful beach three kilometers from here. You could take her there.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: You think she'd like that?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAYID: I took Shannon there once.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Michael. Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE:  So, it worked?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: What are you talking about, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: Your deal -- the trade. If they gave us Michael...
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: They didn't give us anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: So, it was just a coincidence that he came wandering out?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: I was shouting; he heard my voice. What, they just let Michael go hoping we would keep up our end of the bargain? You think they're on the honor system?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 KATE:  Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: Come out, come out whoever you are. I know you're there.  Don't make me come in after you.  Well, well, well, what have we got here? Was little red riding hood going to follow the big bad wolf back to his big old stash-o-guns?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Why don't you give me that one, right there?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: I ain't going to gimme you nothing.  We've been through this, Lucy.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: What you gonna do now, Muchacha?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN:  We need some damn music in here.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Who is she?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: Who is who?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: That woman.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: She is a very long story, Sarah.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: It's Ana Lucia.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: Well, I'm still Tom.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: You're pathetic, that's what you are.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: You bet your sweet ass I am.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA:  Why are you here?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: I'm here because I can't apologize to my son. He tried to help me, so I thanked him by cutting him off. I thanked him by hating him. You came here for the same reason I did, kiddo. You ran away.  My, my, look what fate has delivered up this time. Come on, let's go have a drink or ten and be pathetic together. What do you say?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: No. No.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: It's your call. 
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: Hey, I'm walking here!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Wait, don't. Let's just get the hell out of Sydney. Let's just go. Let's go back.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CHRISTIAN: I can't ever go back. See ya, kiddo.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: Don't you want my phone number?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: You tell anyone about this and I'll kill you. 
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: I guess that takes cuddling off the table.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY:  Hey there. How's it going?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: This isn't what it looks like.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: And, what does it look like?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: It looks like something that... it's not. Aw, man. I'm so busted.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: Hurley, I'm not here to tell you how to act around food.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: Naw, I'm not busted for that. I'm busted for something else. I was packing a picnic because I was kind of hoping that you'd want to go with me. You know, as an 'us' thing. But, it was a surprise.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: Really? That's very sweet.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: So, you want to go?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: Where to?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: Can that part still be a surprise?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Hey, you're back.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: So, the Others -- they didn't show up?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: No. Michael's back, though.  What happened here?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: My fault. I left the tap on in the bathroom sink and Ana wiped out and hit her head on the bathroom counter. And I'm sorry, again.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Yeah, don't worry about it.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 KATE:  Jack? Jack. I think he's waking up.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Hey, Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Hey, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: Wait a minute... how did I get...?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Wait, try to take it easy, okay. You're back in the hatch. We found you out in the jungle last night.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: Oh, my head.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: Welcome back.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: Hey, John. I found them. After I left I hiked North back to where we were . I hiked to the beach -- followed the shore line. A day later I saw one.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: What did he look like?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: He was dirty, worn clothing, no shoes, simple. Just like the rest of them.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Like the rest of them?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: Yeah, his people -- the Others. I followed him back to his camp. They live in tents -- canvas tents and teepees. They eat dried fish. They're worse off than we are.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 KATE: How many of them were there?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: I counted 22.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: And, the boat?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: I didn't see it.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Did you see Walt?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: No. But I know he's there.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: What about everyone else they took? Cindy -- did you see any other kids?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: No, no, no kids, no. But I think they were in the same place as my boy. They have a hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: How do you know that they...
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: There's a set of metal doors leading underground. What else could it be?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: And you think that's where they're keeping the kids?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: They keep it guarded 24/7. Two guards, two guns. And two guns is all I saw. They're barely armed. Most of them are old and half of them are women. I wanted -- I couldn't save him. So I came back to tell you -- tell you that we can take them. As soon as I get my strength back, I will take us back there. And we are going to get my boy back.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: You were right.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: Right about what?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: About Henry -- what you and Sayid did to him when you first found him. You were right. I don't like how you did it, but I shouldn't have gotten in your way.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: Well, you did what you thought was right at the time you thought it, Jack. I just hope that next time you decide to do something you include me. And something tells me that's going to be soon.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: You heard Michael. We can take them.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: Our friend with the beard told us not to cross the line.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: These people are liars, John. Why should we take their word on anything?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: I couldn't agree more. So, now what?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 KATE: Where are you going?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: To get our guns back from Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: We're going to need you to help convince him.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 KATE: Who's going to take care of Michael?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: I'll stay. You guys go ahead.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: You sure?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Give Sawyer my best.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Alright, we'll be back soon.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: Watch your head. Almost there.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: You ever watch the Flintstones?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: Sure, I used to watch it all the time when I was in the hospital -- when I broke my hip.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: Well, did you ever notice how Fred would run by the same thing over and over again?  Third time past this tree.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: Uh, that's a different tree.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: Hurley, it's okay if you're lost.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: Dude, I'm not lost. Will you trust me?  We're right about to walk on the most excellent secret beach on the Island, and -- surprise!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: Uh, Hurley, this is our beach. There's Jin. Hey, I'll tell you what -- why not have the picnic here? Come on, give me the blankets.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: Blankets?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: You don't have any blankets? How about drinks?  Okay, I'll tell you what, I will handle the blankets. You just track down Rose and Bernard. I saw them pull wine from the pallet, okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 HURLEY: Oh, wine. Groovy. Hey, maybe if I get drunk enough I'll remember where I know you from.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY: Yeah, okay. 
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Sawyer, put the book down.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: It's not a book, it's a manuscript. I'm about to be the first and only guy to find out who done it. I think I've got it figured out. Cool your damn jets and walk around the coconut trees; I've got, like, ten pages left.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: Hey!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: You want to figure it out?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: What is your problem, Doc?!
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: It's time to give us the guns back.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: You burn the ending of my book and now you want...
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: Where are they, James?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: You too, Brutus?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 KATE: Just take us there, Sawyer, alright? Quit playing around.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER:  What, did you bring her along for a sympathy vote? She ain't in my head, Doc.  Why don't you two just go play in the jungle, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK:  Take us to the guns, now.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: Ah, that bitch. She stole my damn gun -- Ana Lucia.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: Why would she need a gun?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 SAWYER: Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LOCKE: Jack, I need to tell you something.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Pick it up. Cut yourself loose.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Just do it.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: Why?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: You know why.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: He kept saying you were misunderstood.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: Goodwin. Yes, he told us all about you, Ana -- how he thought you were worthy, and that he could change you. But he was wrong. And it cost him his life.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: He was going to kill me.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: Was he?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Are you done?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: Yes, Ana, I'm done.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 GALE: So, this is it, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Yes, Henry. This is it.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 JACK: I want you to listen to me, okay, because I'm asking you a favor, Crissy. I'm standing in front of you in the same suit that I'm wearing to my father's funeral. And I'm asking you a favor.  In 16 hours I need to land at LAX, and I need that coffin to clear customs because there's going to be a hearse waiting there , and I need that hearse to take me and that coffin to a cemetery. Why? Crissy, why can't I just bring him to a funeral home and make all the arrangements? Why can't I really take my time with it? Because -- because I need it to be done. I need it to be over. I just -- I need to bury my father.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA:  That was an airplane. No, I'm not at work. I'm in Sydney. That's right, Australia. I -- I don't know, I -- I made a mistake, mom. You knew, so I got as far away from you as I could. But now -- I want to come home, mom.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CAPTAIN: So come home.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: I'm on Oceanic flight 815.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 CAPTAIN: I'll be there when you land, mija.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: Where is everybody?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: What you said got them worked up. They went to get all the guns back from Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: Sawyer? Sawyer has all the guns?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Long story.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: At least he didn't get that one.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Yeah. Too bad I can't use it.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: Use it on what?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: We caught one of them -- the Others. He's locked up in there.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: How long has he...?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: Over a week.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: And you're what -- taking care of him?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: He tried to kill me today, so I wanted him dead. I couldn't do it. I couldn't even kill him. I looked at him and he -- I can't do this anymore.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: Then let me do it. They're animals. I've seen these people and they are animals. They took my son -- right out of my hands -- they took my son and -- I'll do it. Give me the gun. I'll kill him. Because that's what they do.  What's the combination?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: 18 right, 1 left, 31 right.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 MICHAEL: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode20 ANA: For what?
Lost.Season02.Episode20 LIBBY:  Michael?!
Lost.Season02.Episode21 ANA:  What are you building?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Hello, Ana.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 ANA: Well, hello yourself. So, are you going to tell me? What is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: I am building a church.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 ANA: Now, why the hell would you want to do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Because I was told to.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 ANA: Told to by who?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: I was just told. I think it was in a dream.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 ANA: A dream like this one?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 ANA: You need to help John.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Yemi?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 YEMI: Hello, brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Forgive me. I should have listened to you. You were right. I didn't want to do it.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 YEMI:  The work being done in this place is important, Eko. It is more important than anything. And it is in danger. You must help John. He has lost his way. You must make him take you to the question mark.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 YEMI: John will not want to show you, so you must make him.  Eko, there are many distractions, brother , but you must move past them. What is done is done. Do you understand?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Yes, Yemi.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 YEMI: And, Eko, bring the axe.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CHARLIE: What's the matter?  You alright, mate?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: I need to find John.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: What were you thinking, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 KATE: Jack, leave him alone.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: No, Jack, don't leave him alone.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: Shut it, Sawyer. If Ana hadn't lifted your gun we wouldn't...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: Well, ain't that swell, Gimpy McCrutch over here covers up that the Artist Formally Known as Henry Gale tried to strangle your little amiga, and suddenly it's on me when she goes vigilante.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: How about you go back to the beach?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 KATE: Hey, enough -- both of you.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: Michael, hey.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MICHAEL: He shot me.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: Who?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MICHAEL: He's gone. He ran out.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK:  Go, I got him.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MICHAEL: I was sleeping and I heard gunshots. I came out of the bedroom and there was this guy. He had a gun and...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: Okay, come on, we've got to get you up.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO:  Let me help you.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 KATE: She's dead.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: Okay, we've got to get her up. We've got to get her to the back room, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Grant us this mercy, oh Lord. We beseech Thee. Amen.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: She's in shock. Alright, we've got to keep pressure on this.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 KATE: Can you do anything? Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: I heard you. Keep pressure on her, okay. 
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MICHAEL: How is she?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: I'm doing what I can. How long ago?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: When did this happen? How long ago did he leave?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MICHAEL: I don't know. 20 minutes, maybe a half hour.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: We can pick up the trail, catch up to him.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: Man's got a head-start, a gun, and he ain't afraid to...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: He shot 3 of our people! One of them is dead, one of them...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: Who's going to take care of Libby while you're off playing Daniel Boone?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: I will go. John, you have tracking experience, yes?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: We will find his trail together.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: You find anything -- anything -- you come right back here and we figure out what we're going to do next, together.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Let's go, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: How long has it been since your last confession?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CALDWELL: Oh, good question. Too many years for me to even remember.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: What do you wish to ask God's forgiveness for? What sins have you committed?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CALDWELL: Let's see. Well, I slept with another woman besides my wife.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Just once, or many times?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CALDWELL: How many is many?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: To receive God's forgiveness you must be penitent for your sins.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CALDWELL: Oh, I also forged ID papers for a guy pretending to be a priest.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Do you have it?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CALDWELL: What'd you do, Padre? Skim from the collection plate? You know, I've got some friends in Los Angeles. I could get you on with them.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Doing what?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CALDWELL: You know, stuff.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MONSIGNOR:  Good morning, Father Tunde.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Good morning, Monsignor. This is Mr. Caldwell. He has been helping me arrange my trip to the United States.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MONSIGNOR: I'm sorry Father, but I've got some bad news. You're going to have to postpone your trip. It appears we have a miracle.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JOYCE: My daughter, she -- she drowned.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: I'm very sorry for your loss.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JOYCE: Oh, no, you don't understand. She came back to life. We were out in the back blocks and Charlotte must have slipped; and she went into the river and she's not much of a swimmer. She was dead and the next day she woke up. Don't you understand? It's a miracle -- a confirmation of faith. Everyone needs to know about it. People need...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Where is your daughter?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JOYCE: At home with my husband.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: What does he think?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JOYCE: The world needs to know about this. We need to tell the Vatican. We need to tell the world-
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MONSIGNOR: I'm sorry; we can't just do that, Mrs. Malkin. The church needs to conduct an investigation before anyone can be told. Father Tunde will start this process, if you'll permit him.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Mrs. Malkin, will you excuse us for a moment, please.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JOYCE: Of course.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Monsignor, with all due respect, I cannot do what you have asked.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MONSIGNOR: Why not?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Because I do not believe what this woman says.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MONSIGNOR: Why do you think I chose you?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Are you seeing something I'm not?  Hey! I haven't seen a single track or piece of sign since we left the Hatch. What the hell are you following?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Where is the question mark?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: The what?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: The question mark, John. Where is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: You know what, you keep chasing after your own shadow; I'm going back.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: I know you do not want to show me, but you must.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: No, I don't have to show you anything.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Then I am sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: You hit me. Why did you...?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Because you were being difficult.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Are you insane?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Ana Lucia, your friend, was just murdered and you...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Ana wants me to help you, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Help me do what?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Find the question mark.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: You don't even know what you're talking about, do you?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: No, but you know what I am talking about, John, and that is all that matters.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE:  Here, you want to find your damn question mark? Here, this is it right here. Here take it. Take it because it's nothing. It's a memory. It's 10 seconds of nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO:  This is your hatch, yes?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: It's not my hatch.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: If the Swan is where we came from then we go that way.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: We shouldn't even be out here. Ana Lucia would still be alive if I just told Jack that Henry attacked her.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Now, she wants us to go here, John, together. She said this in my dream.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Of course, a dream.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Tell me, John, haven't you ever followed a dream?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MCVAY: So, the Vatican's really interested in this one, eh?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: That depends upon what I put in my report. Why don't you just start by telling me what happened that night?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MCVAY: Well, I got a call around 1am -- Ambrose brought this girl in, dead. She'd been in the water 2 hours.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Have you had much experience in this type of death?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MCVAY: Yeah, of course. I'm, I'm an undertaker.  Well, I mean, it's my day job. I mean, I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner. I mean, I did go to medical school.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: And when did you find out that she was -- not dead?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MCVAY: During the autopsy.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: During the autopsy?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MCVAY: It's alright; I didn't expect you to believe me.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MCVAY: I figured you'd want to have a listen for yourself.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MCVAY:  This is a Caucasian female. She's 161 cm, 51.3 kilos. Body prepped and washed by the very lovely Valerie McDervish.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 VALERIE:  Ian, stop it.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MCVAY:  Commencing with the post. This is a clear case of drowning. I'll begin with a thoracic...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MCVAY: Take it. No, please, I don't ever want to listen to that tape again.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: You lost already?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Your map is inexact.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: No kidding.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: These landmarks -- is this a river?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: No, it's a wavy line. I didn't draw it, I just transcribed it. I told you, I don't even know if it is a map.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Let's assume it is.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: What's the axe for?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: I don't know yet.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: You are the one that found this plane, yes?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Yeah.  It was up there.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: And what made it fall?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Boone. Boone made it fall. Then he died. A sacrifice that the Island demanded.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Excuse me?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Nothing. So, what's next?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: We make camp. Get some sleep, and wait for further instruction.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: Where the hell are they?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 KATE: Just calm down. Finding his trail in the dark is not going to be easy. They'll be back.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MICHAEL: She say anything? Libby?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK:  She's still unconscious. The bleeding stopped.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 KATE: That's good, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: No, it's not good.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MICHAEL: And there's nothing you can...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: I can make her comfortable.  But I don't have what I need.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: Why are you looking at me? I gave you all the damn meds 2 days ago...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: The heroin, Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: Give me 20 minutes.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: Kate's going to go with you.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: It doesn't take 2 people to...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: Kate is going with you.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 KATE: What are you talking about? Why would he need me to go with him?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: Jacko here knows his heroin's in my stash with the guns. So, I can either show you where it's at, or let poor Libby suffer. That pretty much it, Doc?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: Let's go, Freckles.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 KATE: I'm curious about something.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: Yeah, what's that?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 KATE: How did Ana Lucia get your gun?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: I don't know, she must've lifted it off me.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 KATE: She pick-pocketed your gun? How'd she do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: Well, if I knew how she did it, she wouldn't be able to do it, now would she?  After you.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 KATE: I thought you were taking me to your stash.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: Do you have to make everything so damned difficult? Just go in.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 KATE: You kept the guns here, all this time, right under you?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 SAWYER: Fooled you, didn't I?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 HURLEY: Hey guys, you seen Libby around?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 YEMI: Eko.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO:  Yemi.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 YEMI:  You'll wake John. Come, follow me.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO:  Yemi.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Yemi! Yemi.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 YEMI: Wake up, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Are you alright, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: You had a dream.  Was there a man? A priest?  The man that you saw was my brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Your brother?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: This is why we needed to come together. This is how we are going to be led, and how we will know where to go next.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: But I don't know where to go.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Did he tell you anything?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: No, he, he...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Nothing? Anything?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: It wasn't even me. It was you. It didn't -- he wanted me to follow him.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Follow him where?  Wait here.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Eko, it was just a dream. It's not safe. Eko!
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JOYCE: Father, I'm afraid it's not a very good time. You'll have to come back later.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Mrs. Malkin, I must speak to your daughter. Yesterday in the church you said that...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JOYCE: I know what I said. It's just that right this minute is not a very good time.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MALKIN: Get back in the house, Joyce. Get her inside.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JOYCE: Richard, please.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MALKIN: Inside, now!
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MALKIN: I know why you're here, friend. But you can save yourself the trouble. What happened here was not a miracle.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: The doctor that treated your daughter seems to feel differently.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MALKIN: Treated her? He tried to cut her open. He's just trying to cover up his own negligence. He tell you the whole story -- how she supposedly drowned? She fell into a mountain river, her body shut down; she went into hypothermia which made her appear dead.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: And why is your wife so convinced otherwise?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MALKIN: Because she's a zealot. All of this -- everything she's doing -- is to spite me.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Why would she spite you?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MALKIN: Because she knows I'm a fraud. Because I make my living as a psychic. You see, that's what I do. I gather intelligence on people and I exploit it. Everyday I meet people looking for a miracle, desperate to find one. But there are none to be had. Not in this world, anyway.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: I will report back to my Monsignor that there was no miracle here. Your daughter is alive. This is all that matters.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Eko, be careful!
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Eko! Eko!
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Eko, what's up there?! You see anything?!
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: I don't see nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: It's salty.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: The earth. It's been salted so that nothing can grow.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Why would anyone wanna salt -- there's nothing here.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: I believe they made a circle -- a target -- so that this place can be seen from up above.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: They? What place?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: The place that this plane fell upon, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: John! Will you help me with this?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Wait.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Eko, may I?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Please, be my guest.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 HURLEY:  We were going to have our first date.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 MICHAEL: Date?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 HURLEY: Yeah, a picnic on the beach. I'm glad you're okay, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: John.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 WICKMAN: Hello, I'm Dr. Mark Wickman, and this is the orientation film for Station 5 of DHARMA Initiative. Station 5, or the Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in DHARMA Initiative projects can be observed and recorded -- not only for posterity, but for the ongoing refinement of the Initiative as a whole. As Karen DeGroot herself has written, "Careful observation in the only key to true and complete awareness." Your tour of duty will last 3 weeks and during this time you and your partner will observe a psychological experiment in progress. Your duty is to observe team members at another station on the Island. These team members are not aware that they are under surveillance, or that they are the subjects of an experiment. Working in 8 hour shifts, you and your partner will record everything you observe in the notebooks we provided. What is the nature of the experiment, you might ask? What do these subjects believe they are accomplishing as they struggle to fulfill their tasks? You, as the observer, don't need to know. All you need to know is the subjects believe their job is of the utmost importance. Remember, everything that occurs, no matter how minute or seemingly unimportant, must be recorded. Each time a notebook is filled with the fruits of your diligent observation, roll it up  containers provided. Then, simply place the container in the pneumatic tube, and presto, it will be transported directly to us. At the end of your 8 hour shift, proceed to the Pala ferry which will take you back to the barracks  prepare for your next shift . On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us here at the DHARMA Initiative, thank you. Namaste and good luck.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Would you like to watch that again?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: No. No, I've seen enough.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: I'm taking this back with us.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Because they may be important.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Important? I'm sorry, weren't you just watching the same thing I was?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Yes, John. And I believe the work you have been doing is more important now than ever.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: What work?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Pushing the button.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: That's not work. That's a joke -- rats in a maze with no cheese.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: It is work, John. We are being tested.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Tested?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: The reason to do it -- push the button -- is not because we are told to do so in a film.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: Oh -- well, then what is the reason, Mr. Eko?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: We do it because we believe we are meant to. Isn't that the reason you pushed it, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LOCKE: I was never meant to do anything! Every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button! You think it's important? You think it's necessary? It's nothing. It's nothing. It's meaningless. And who are you to tell me that it's not?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 AGENT:  That's flight 815, leaving from gate 23.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CHARLOTTE: I had to see you.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Look, your father said I shouldn't...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CHARLOTTE: I know. He doesn't want me talking to you. And I know you probably think I'm crazy, but I have a message for you and I promised to deliver it.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: A message?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CHARLOTTE: He says you were a good priest.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Who says that?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CHARLOTTE: Yemi.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO:  Speaking about my brother is not a joke, so you should be very careful what you say next.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CHARLOTTE: I saw him when I was -- between places. He said that you would come and see me. He said that even though you were pretending, you're a good man.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Who put you up to this? Did your father tell you to do this?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CHARLOTTE: He wants you to know that he will see you soon. He said that even though you don't have faith in yourself, that he has faith in you.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: Why are you doing this to me? What do you want from me? Why are you doing this to me?!
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LIBBY:  Is everything alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 CHARLOTTE: He has faith in you. One day you'll believe me. 
Lost.Season02.Episode21  Announcer: Oceanic Flight 815 is now boarding...
Lost.Season02.Episode21 EKO: This cross was worn by my brother, Yemi. Yemi was a great man, a priest, a man of God. And because I betrayed him he was shot and died. He was placed on a plane which took off from an airstrip in Nigeria half a world from here. Then, the plane that I was on crashed on this island. And somehow, here, I found my brother again. I found him in the same plane that took off from Nigeria. In the same plane that lies above us now -- that has concealed this place. And I took this cross from around Yemi's neck and put it back on mine, just as it was on the day I first took another man's life. So let me ask you -- how can you say this is meaningless? I believe the work being done in the Hatch is more important than anything. If you will not continue to push the button, John, I will.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 HURLEY: Can, can I talk to her?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: Sure. 
Lost.Season02.Episode21 HURLEY:  Hey, it's Hurley. Hugo. I'm sorry I forgot the blankets. I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.  Libby?
Lost.Season02.Episode21 LIBBY: Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode21 JACK: Michael. He's okay. He made it, Libby. It's okay. It's alright.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL:  John, John, I was hoping I could borrow one of these guns.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 LOCKE: Is it supposed to be a secret?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Jack's asleep.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 LOCKE:  More target practice?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Well, you know, just want to stay sharp. 
Lost.Season02.Episode22 LOCKE: You got a date?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: No. Old habits, you know.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 LOCKE: Yes, I do.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Thanks, man. Hey, can I just get a couple of these bullets? I promise I won't...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Damn! I'm sorry...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 LOCKE: Naw, that's alright. I got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Come on. Where are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL:  You okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MONITOR: ok, no time, come soon?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL:  I'm ready. Coming NOW. You said north -- north WHERE?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MONITOR: when they take me out. there's huge rocks with a big HOLE in the middle by the beach. you'll know when you see.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL:  It's gonna be okay. I'm coming.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL:  I'm coming, Walt.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK:  Locke.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: John.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL:  Stay in there. Stay.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Michael, what are you...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Stay in there, Jack!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Hey, whatever's going on...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Look, I'm going after my son. I'm going after my son and nobody is going to stop me, okay. Okay, that is my right. That is a father's right.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Hey. What are you doing out here?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Nothing. Just getting some air.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Come on. We should talk.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: How many?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: Rifles and pistols? 11 total.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: That's it?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: That's it. In case you forgot, they took 5 of 'em right off us.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: How long would it take us to get to their camp?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: We leave now, move fast? Middle of the night tomorrow. Look, they have no idea I know where they are. They won't be expecting us. So we get the guns and we go. Right now. Just the 5 of us.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: No, no, 5 is not enough. You said there's at least 20 of them. They've got our guns and we're not even sure if what you saw was...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Hey, I know what I saw! We take too many people, they'll hear us coming. I'm not taking a damn army across the Island, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Michael, you sure you're in the best place to be making decisions for all of us right now?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: You got a son, Jack?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 HURLEY:  They're dead! Ana Lucia and Libby are dead. I mean, we haven't even buried them yet.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK:  Me and you will take Libby, okay.  Can you?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 KATE: Yeah, of course.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Sawyer, would you?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK:  You should stay here. We'll bury them tonight, then we'll figure out what's next.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL:  Hey, put your hands up. Put 'em up! Don't move.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 PICKETT: Relax buddy. I ain't movin'. Why don't you just put that down...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Shut up!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 PICKETT: You're Walt's old man, aren't you?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 TOM: What are you doing?! We need him.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 TOM: Bag him quick. His friends are right behind us.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: Hello.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: I didn't hear you come in, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: I left my shoes outside. They were muddy.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Did you find him? Henry?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: I hear you're a priest.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: I guess you believe in hell, then.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO:  For a brief time I served in a small parish in England. Every Sunday after Mass, I would see a young boy waiting in the back of the church. And then one day, the boy confessed to me that he had beaten his dog to death with a shovel. He said that the dog had bitten his baby sister on the cheek; and he needed to protect her. And he wanted to know whether he would go to hell for this. I told him that God would understand -- that he would be forgiven, as long as he was sorry. But the boy did not care about forgiveness. He was only afraid that if he did go to hell -- that dog would be there waiting for him.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Hey, are you alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: I was coming back to check on you.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Yeah, man. I had to get out of there. Just -- I have to get my son back.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: We're going to help you do that, Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: But, it's got to be the way I said, man. Just the 5 of us. Otherwise, it won't work. It won't work.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: I promise. We're going to figure that out.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: No, I already have figured it out. It's got to be just the people who already know. You, me, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley. That's it. Anybody else -- look, it puts him in more danger. You don't get to decide this. It's my son. It's my call. And that's the way it has to be.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Then that's the way it'll be.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: Hey. Hey, Aaron. Hey, big guy. Hi. Have you seen Eko?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CLAIRE: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: You know, we're building a church.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CLAIRE: Is there something you want, Charlie?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: Yeah, I found something on the pallet I thought you might need.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CLAIRE: Vaccine?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: I don't know what we need a vaccine for, but I figured if anyone should have it, you and the baby should.  It's alright. It's a pneumatic injector. You just put into your leg  and it goes right in. Quite painless, really.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CLAIRE: You seem to know a lot about it.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: I tried it. I wanted to make sure it was safe before giving it to you and the baby.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CLAIRE: Well, how do you feel? I mean, did it do anything? What did it, what did it do?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: I feel fine. Anyway, it says you're supposed to give yourself a shot every 9 days. Alright? So, there's enough here for you and the baby for a while. That's it. I'll put it -- I'll put it... .
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CLAIRE: Thank you.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: Welcome.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CLAIRE: I should really feed him.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: Yeah. Hey, Claire, did you think that maybe you and I could...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CLAIRE:  Oh my God! Michael's back.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SUN: 여보, 여기도. ...Michael?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JIN: 야! 너무 반갑다, 그 동안 얼마나 걱정했는데! 괜찮아? Okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah. It's good to see you, too.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SUN:  Are you alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Yeah, I am. It's just -- I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SUN: 어머나! 어떻게 된 거야? Who?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Ana Lucia and Libby.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JIN: 아니, 어떻게...?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SUN: What happened to them?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: They were murdered.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 TOM: Hey there, Michael.  Not going to hold that against you. Fair's fair. I took your boy. But don't do that again, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Where is he you son-of-a-bitch?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 PICKETT:  Hey, look at what I found? She was following her friend about a half a click behind us.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 TOM:  You make one sound you'll never see your boy again.  Gag him. Get ready with the torches. I'm going to talk to her people.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 LOCKE: I think we'd better head back.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Just find the trail, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 LOCKE: I've lost the trail.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: You don't just lose a trail! You just don't want to find him.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 LOCKE: Yeah, that's right, Jack. I've been running through the jungle, toward the sounds of gunfire, because I don't care about Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: You know what happens if we just turn around and go back? We're never going to see him again. And that's going to be on us -- on you, and on me.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 TOM: You're exactly right, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Who are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: He's the son-of-a-bitch that shot me on the raft. 
Lost.Season02.Episode22 TOM: Why don't you point the gun down?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 ALEX: It's okay. He's just delivering a message. He has to scare your friends to do it.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK:  I don't believe you.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 TOM: You don't believe what?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: I think there's more of us than there are of you.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 TOM: That's an interesting theory.  Light 'em up!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 TOM: Give me your weapons, turn around, go home.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 TOM: I hoped it wouldn't come to this.  Bring her out, Alex!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 PICKETT: Go on.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 ALEX: You.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 PICKETT: Come on, Alex.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 ALEX: Please?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 PICKETT:  Let's go. Up. 
Lost.Season02.Episode22 ALEX: Is Claire okay? Did she have the baby? Is it okay? Is it a boy or a girl?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 TOM: Like I said -- curiosity. 
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER:  You and me ain't done, Zeke.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 TOM: His friends are going home.  Divvy 'em up.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 ALEX:  Sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: What do you say, Doc?  Here I was thinking the Irish drink when somebody dies. 
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: I'm not Irish.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: Neither am I. So what happened out there in the jungle?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Exactly what he said happened -- he found their camp...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: I ain't talking about Mike. You and Freckles -- before you found him you all were gone all night.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: We were caught in a net.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: It means we got caught in a net.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: Is that what they're calling it these days?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: Is it true -- Henry's gone?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: Who's going after him?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Locke and Eko went out in the middle of the night, but...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: But we haven't seen either of them since.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID:  Those are the guns, aren't they? What are you doing with them?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: What do you think we're doing? It's time to finish this.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: When do we leave?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: In the morning.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: You're not coming, Sayid.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: Excuse me?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Michael wants to keep it small. Me, Kate, Hurley, and him.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: Yeah, well, him says even though Pippy Longstocking and the damn Grape Ape are ideal candidates for the Dirty Dozen -- I'm just going to say we might just want to bring the Red Beret.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: It's Michael's call. He knows where we're going.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: It is not his call, Jack. It's ours.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER:  Welcome aboard.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: So, you wake up in the middle of the night; you grab your Jesus stick; you race off into the jungle. You don't call; you don't write?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: I'm sorry. I had work to do.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: Right, yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: Charlie, would you do me a favor? I was hoping you could bring my things from the beach here.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: What for? You moving in here? Fancy yourself a little bachelor pad?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: Yes. I'm moving in here.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: Well, what about the church? You said we were supposed to be building it together, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: I am supposed to do something different now.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: What am I supposed to do?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: Bring me my things.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE:  Bring your own things.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: Charlie, please.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: You better leg it, mate. Clock's ticking.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: Got some good news for you. Captain Arab's in too. Cavalry rides at sunrise.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: You told Sayid?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: Yeah, I told Sayid.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: You shouldn't have done that!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: Oh, well I'm sorry. I just figure if we're going to war, we'd want the one guy who's actually been in a war. That a problem?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: No, it's not a problem.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER:  Alright then.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 PICKETT: Get up.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Get off of me!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MR. FRIENDLY: You got a problem, Michael?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: You march me day and night without any rest. Yeah, my problem is I'm tired.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MR. FRIENDLY: Well, I'd offer to knock you out and carry you, but we're here.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MR. FRIENDLY: Put him right over here.  Tell her we're here.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 PICKETT: I can't promise this won't hurt. 
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Ow, damn it!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 PICKETT: Relax, just taking some blood.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Taking some blood for what? Who are you people? Where's my son?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 PICKETT: That's it; all done. See you in the funny pages. 
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: Hello, Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Where's my son?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: My name is Ms. Klugh. I was hoping you might help me answer some questions. About Walt.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Where is he?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: Is he your biological son?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: Are you his father?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Yes, I'm his...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: How old was he when he started speaking?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: I, he...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: Did he have any illnesses growing up? Headaches? Fainting spells?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: What? No! I don't -- I wasn't there. He was half way around the world. Why are you asking me all these questions?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: Did Walt ever appear in a place he wasn't supposed to be? You say he was half way around the world -- did you see him?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: I want my son! You bring him to me right now! I want to see my boy!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: For someone who wants his son back so badly, you don't seem to know much about him, Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Hey, you're not coming.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: Welcome back, Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Look, I know Sawyer told you, alright. But, it's not going to work. You're not coming.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: And why is it that I'm not coming?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Because you're going after the guy that escaped. And I'm going after my son.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: Are you implying I'd let a desire for revenge compromise Walt's safety?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: I'm implying that I decide who stays and who goes; and you stay. I know you want to help, right? But I've got to do this my way.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: Of course. Good luck, Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: Bloody hell.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 CHARLIE: Are you kidding me? Did someone put you up to this?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: You were supposed to come right back. You were out in the jungle all night. What happened?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: We were unable to find Henry's trail.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Yeah, I got that. Where's Locke?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: I do not know.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: We're burying Ana Lucia and Libby at sunset.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 EKO: Thank you. I will mourn them in my own way.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: Who's going to talk?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: The funeral. Who's going to talk?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: I'm sure Hurley will want to say something about Libby.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: I never even knew her last name. Ana Lucia.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: It's Cortez.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: Cortez, there you go. I screwed her.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: That's how she got my gun. Ana, she jumped me.  We got caught in a net.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Why are you telling me this, Sawyer?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAWYER: Because you're about the closest thing I've got to a friend, Doc. And because she's gone. Well, at least now we get to kill to somebody.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Jack fill you in on the plan?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 KATE: What plan?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: We're leaving first thing tomorrow -- back across the Island to their camp.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 KATE: Okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL:  What about you, man? You coming with us?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 HURLEY: Why would I want to go?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Because they killed her!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 KATE: Michael, come on.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: What do you say, Hugo?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 HURLEY: I'm sorry about Walt, dude. But I'm not coming.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: You're sorry...!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 KATE: Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: Dinner time.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: When are you going to do it?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: When am I going to do what?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Kill me. I've seen where you live. I know how to get here. You have been asking me asking me questions I don't know the answer to for a week. I don't even think my son is alive.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: He is alive, Michael. He's standing outside right now.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: What, do you think I'm stupid?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: There's been a development since you came here, Michael. One of our people was captured by yours.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: So, go get him back.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: We can't do that. But you can. And if you do, we'll let you and Walt go free.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: I want to see my son.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: Michael...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: I want to see him! If he is out there you bring him in! You bring him in here right now!!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH:  Pickett!  You have 3 minutes.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Walt.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 WALT: Dad.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Let him go! Let him go! Get your hands off him, right now!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 WALT: Dad, don't.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Are you okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 WALT: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: I just -- did they hurt you?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 WALT: They make me take tests.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: They make you what?!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: We're not going to talk about that.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 WALT: How's Vincent?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Vincent, he's great. He's great. He misses you. Hey don't, don't, don't be scared, man. Don't be scared. It's going to be over real soon, okay? I'm going to get you out of here, okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 WALT: They're not who they say they are. They're pretending.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: Walt! You want me to put you in the room again?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Pretending? Pretending what?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: That's it. We're done.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: No, wait. Hey wait, wait, wait. Come here, Walt. Wait, come here, Walt.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 WALT: Dad, don't leave me. Help me, please! Don't leave me!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: I won't, man. I'm going to take -- I'm going to get you out of here. I promise you, I will get you out of here.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 WALT: Dad! Dad!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Let him go! Walt wait! Let go of him!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 WALT: I love you!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Walt, I'm going to get you out of here!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 WALT: I love you!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Walt, I love you too, Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 WALT: Let me go! Let me go!
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: I'm going to get you out of here.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: After you release our man, I'm going to need you to do something else.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Whatever you want.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: I'm writing 4 names down -- 4 of your friends. We need you to bring them here. You have to bring only these 4 people, Michael. Just them. If you don't bring all the people on the list, you'll never see Walt again.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL:  Okay, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: Do you understand, Michael?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL:  Yes. What do I tell them.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: Doesn't matter. Make up a story. They'll be angry enough to believe whatever you say.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Who's James Ford?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: You know him as Sawyer. You know the rest of them?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Yeah. I know them. If I do all this -- if I do what you say...
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MS. KLUGH: You get your son back. You both go free.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 MICHAEL: Then I want the boat.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: When the plane crashed I was on my way to Los Angeles to bury my dad.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: I'm sorry to hear that.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Yeah. It seems like such a long time ago now. I was going to go right from the airport to the cemetery but I had no idea what I was going to say. Here we are again.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: I think Michael has been compromised.  Let's keep walking, Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: What do you mean "compromised"?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: His actions are not those of a man who is telling the truth.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Why would he lie to us?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: Because I believe a father would do anything for his son. Because I believe Michael may have freed Henry. And because I believe he is leading you into a trap.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: You believe a lot, Sayid.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: I also believe that Henry was one of them.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Alright, let's go talk to him.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: No, he must continue to believe he's in control.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Why the hell would we want to do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: So we can create an advantage.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: How?
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SAYID: I don't know yet. But we have one more night to figure that out.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 JACK: Ana Lucia Cortez was -- before we crashed she was a police officer. I don't think it was easy for her being here. But I think she did the best she could. She was a woman of few words, and I'm going to follow her example. Rest in peace, Ana.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 HURLEY: Libby was -- she was -- she -- Libby was a psychologist, or psychiatrist -- one of those. Either way, she probably helped a lot of people. She helped me. She was my friend. It's not fair that this happened to her. It's not.  I'm going with you. Goodbye, Libby.
Lost.Season02.Episode22 SUN: Boat. Boat!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Are we rescued?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 REDSHIRT: Saved?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: Perhaps it's them.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: You see anything?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Maybe it's a trap?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: What do you mean a trap?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: You hear that? 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 VOICE:  Damn it.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: You. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: Okay, okay, just wait one second, okay. I'll be right back.  Everybody needs to know what's going on, Jack. There's a boat...
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: Just tell them Desmond's back until I find out the rest, okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: So, before you ran off, I guess you just forgot to mention that you still have a sailboat. Why'd you come back?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND:  Do you think I did it on purpose? I was sailing for two and half weeks, bearing due West and making 9 knots. I should have been in Fiji in less than a week. But the first piece of land I saw wasn't Fiji, was it? No. No, it was here—this, this island. And you know why? Because this is it. This is all there is left. This ocean and this place here. We are stuck in a bloody snow globe! There's no outside world! There's no escape! So, just go away, huh. Let me drink.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Are you still pushing it?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: Yeah, we're still pushing it.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MASTER SERGEANT: Set of keys; one pocket watch, gold plated; one photograph (the same picture Desmond had in the Hatch); one book, Our Mutual Friend. Why didn't you bring that inside?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: To avoid temptation, brother. I've read everything Mr. Charles Dickens has ever written - every wonderful word. Every book except this one. I'm saving it so it will be the last thing I ever read before I die.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MASTER SERGEANT: Nice idea, as long as you know when you're going to die.  Lance Corporal Desmond David Hume your sentence is hereby complete and you are now and forever dishonorably discharged from the Royal Scotts Regiment of Her Majesty's Armed Forces. Long live the queen. Enjoy your sodding book.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 WIDMORE: You want a ride?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Not with you.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 WIDMORE: Get in the car.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Did you bring me a present?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 WIDMORE: Actually, two presents. One of these boxes contains your past, Hume. The other, your future. Go ahead, open it.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: You're a bastard, you know that?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 WIDMORE: The fact that she never received your sentiments is good for her. Good, because as far as she's concerned you've forsaken her. And that's the way it's going to stay.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Is it now?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 WIDMORE: Penelope's moved on, Hume. She's getting married.  This is for your new life—away from my daughter. The conditions are simple—no contact, no calls, no posts. You just run away, Desmond.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: And what makes you think I would just run away?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 WIDMORE: Because you're a coward.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: On the way to the funeral I told you that Michael had been compromised by the Others, and then you asked me how we might take advantage of that. I believe fate has given us our answer—the boat.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: The boat?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: This camp Michael is leading you to across the Island—that is where they will set their trap. While Michael leads you by land, I can approach far more quickly by sea. And I can go ashore undetected.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: Go ashore and do what?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: Scout them—their numbers and positions, their weapons. Then I'll go to the nearest beach and start a signal fire with these . They burn with a dark, black smoke. You and your team will come to meet me at the signal and we will go in together.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: We're not even sure if Michael's been turned by them.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: He has been turned.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: I'll have to tell Kate, and Hurley and Sawyer what we're doing.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: No. Michael cannot sense we know he is lying. All we have is the element of surprise, Jack. Right now it's only your responsibility to keep it secret.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: Black smoke, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: This time they will know that we are coming.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: Hello, John. Where have you been?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: I've been thinking.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: About what?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: That in a minute that computer's going to start beeping, and when it does you're going to let it go. You're going to let it run down to zero, past zero. And you're not going to push the button.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: But I am going to push the button. Why wouldn't I?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Because you don't want to be a slave.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: I am a slave to nothing.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: You're a slave to that , just like I was. So I'm going to tell you again—don't push it.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: Do not tell me what I can do.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: You cannot push that button.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: No, it's not real. We're only puppets—puppets on strings. As long as we push it, we'll never be free.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO:  Well, you're free now, John. Do not come back.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: No way. I'm not even going to kill someone.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: Ain't that the point?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: I thought the point was to get Walt back?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: What's the matter?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: All that stuff we found in the medical station—costumes, make-up, fake beards—what if these people just want us to think they're hillbillies?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: Listen, I was there. I saw them. They are hillbillies. They live in huts; they eat fish; they're probably more scared than we are. And they have no idea we're on our way.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: Alright, enough jibber-jabber, let's roll.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: I need your boat.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I wouldn't waste your time. There's nothing out there, pal.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: I'm not going out there. I need to get to the North shore of the Island, and quickly.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Going to see the hostiles, are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: You know what, ignorance is bliss. The boat's all yours, brother, for all the good it'll do you.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: I don't know how to sail.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Then I suggest you find someone who does.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Just give me which ever one has the most caffeine in it, brother.  Damn, um, I'm sorry. I've just arrived and I spent all my American money on a taxi.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY:  I've got it.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: That's not necessary.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY: It's just 4 bucks.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I don't suppose you have 42,000 more of those do you?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY: Depends on what it's for.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I was joking.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY: No you weren't.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY: So, a sailing race around the world?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I have 8 months to get into the best shape of my life. I'll tell you what, miss, I'm going to win.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY: And what do you get if you do?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What really matters is who I win it for. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY:  Charles Widmore.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: He tried to buy me off. And when I didn't take his money, he took away the only thing in the world that I ever truly cared about.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY: Who is she?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: His daughter. I was unsuitable on several levels.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY: And what's the 42 grand for?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: It's a wee bit complicated. As of yet, I don't actually have a boat.  Sorry, did I say something wrong?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY: I have a boat. It was my husband's but he got sick. He wanted to sail the Mediterranean—he never—he passed away about a month ago.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY: I want you to have it.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I can't take your boat, miss.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY: But you have to. He'd want you to.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What was your husband's name?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY: David.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: And what did he name his boat?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LIBBY: Elizabeth. He named it after me.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Then I thank you, Elizabeth. And I shall win this race for love.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JIN: 뭐라는 거야?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SUN:  Would you excuse us, please?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: I'll be at the shore.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SUN: 당신이 배로 사이드를 섬 반대쪽으로 데려다 주기를 원해요. 마이클을 도와주기 위해서야. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JIN: 안 돼. 이제 당신을 두고 갈 수 없어. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SUN: 날 두고 당신 혼자 가라는 얘기가 아니에요. 나도 같이 갈 거에요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: Don't even think about it. It's a trap—a net. Rousseau's got them all over the Island.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: How the hell would you know that?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: I tripped one with Jack. We ended up—never mind.  What?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: When the Doc told me you all got caught in a net I thought he meant, uh—something else.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: Since when did you and Jack start talking about me?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: Did that bird just say my name?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: Yeah, it did. Right before it crapped gold.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: Sorry, man. I guess I forgot to load that one. Want to give me the mag?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: John.  What happened to your face?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Nothing, I'm fine.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Hey, uh, if you're feeling a little sorry for yourself you may want to have a drink with your mate from the Hatch. I hear he's a little despondent, as well.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Oh, that's right; you weren't there for the dramatic arrival at the funeral. I think he's pushed your button too many times, if you ask me.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Desmond?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Yeah, Desmond. I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: I'm sorry if what I said was confusing, but I asked Jin to come.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SUN: You need someone to translate. And you need at least two people who know how to sail.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: Desmond managed by himself.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SUN: And look where he ended up.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND:  You're wasting your time, sister. I shot myself with that stuff every 9 days for 3 years.  He's lovely. Is the father here on the Island?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CLAIRE: No. Nope, he's been gone a long time. Sort of walked off the moment he got a bit scared by the situation.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Well, maybe he knew he'd be a lousy dad—thought he was doing what was best for you.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CLAIRE: He was doing what was best for him.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: How did you find me?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 PENELOPE: The landlord at your flat told me you ran here everyday.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: How did you find me?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 PENELOPE: I have a lot of money, Desmond. With enough money and determination you can find anyone. Did you read your beloved book—the one you were saving?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Not yet.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 PENELOPE: I thought you might have read it while you were away.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I was in prison, not away.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 PENELOPE: Why didn't you write to me?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: When are you getting married, Pen?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 PENELOPE: We haven't set a date yet.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I'll be back in a year.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 PENELOPE: What if you were back, right now?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I'm going to win this race, Pen—his race. And in a year, I'll be back.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 PENELOPE: Desmond, what are you running from?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I have to get my honor back, and that's what I'm running to.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: So what did one snowman say to other snowman?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Smells like carrots.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Hello, Desmond.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Hello yourself, box man.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE:  Do you mind?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Oh, I insist. So you managed to fix the computer, then, did you?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: World's still here, ain't it?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I'm not so sure about that, brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Refresh my memory, Desmond. How long did you say that you were down there in the Hatch?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: 3 years.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Desmond, what if I told you that for all that—all those years that you and all the men before you were down there pushing that button—what if I told you that it was all for nothing?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I'd ask you how the hell did you know something like that?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: I found another hatch—another station on the Island. They called it the Pearl, and I saw a film there—an orientation film. And it said that everything that was happening in our hatch wasn't real—that it was a test—a psychological experiment.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: You're lying.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: You want to take a walk? I'll make the popcorn.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: You're so sure it's not real, then just stop pushing the button!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Well, I have. Except, unfortunately, someone else decided to start. So you're going to sober up. We're going to get a good night's sleep. Tomorrow we're going to find out what happens if that button doesn't get pushed.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: DHARMA nutri-bar?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: No thanks; I'm not hungry.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: You serious?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: Hey, you alright?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: Yeah, just getting some more firewood. Not feeling too hot.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: You shouldn't be out here alone. I'll give you a hand.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: Hey, thanks for coming out here—risking your neck for my boy.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: Live together, die alone, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JIN: 내가 오지 말라고 했잖아. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SUN: 뱃멀미 하는 거 아니에요. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JIN: 알아. 보여줄 게 있어. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: I don't know what is more disquieting—the fact that the rest of the statue is missing, or that it has 4 toes?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO:  John!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE:  Neat trick.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO:  John! John! Can you hear me? Open up.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Are you sure about this, brother?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: I'm more sure about this than anything in my entire life.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO:  Don't do this! John!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Alright then, box man. We wait.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Are you him?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: What did one snowman say to the other?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What are you talking about? Who are you?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: I'm Inman. Kelvin Inman.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What, what happened to my boat?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: I found you washed up on the beach. There was no boat.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What was all that about, then?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Just saving the world.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MARVIN CANDLE: Not long after the experiments began, however, there was an incident. And since that time the following protocol has been observed: every 108 minutes the button must be pushed. From the moment the alarm sounds you will have 4 minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN:  How many times are you going to watch that thing?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Why are there missing parts?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Radzinsky made some edits.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Who's Radzinsky?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: He was my partner.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: And what happened to him?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Just make sure you put that back behind Turn of the Screw when you're done with it.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Why do you wear that suit?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: So I don't get infected out there.  Give yourself a shot of this every 9 days. You were out there a while before I found you. Hope it's not too late.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: John!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Who is he, box man—the man out there pounding on the door?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: His name is Mr. Eko.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Why does Mr. Eko carry around a stick covered in scripture?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Because he's a priest.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: Open the door, please. John! Can you hear me? Open up.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: We locked out a priest?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: Charlie, do you know how they got the Hatch door open?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: No, but if you hum it, I could probably play it.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: How did they open it—the door that says "quarantine"?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: They blew it up, why?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: Charlie, I need your help.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Oh, now I'm back in your good graces, Father?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: Charlie, John has locked me out of the Hatch. And I believe he is doing this because he is going to stop pushing that button. And, Charlie, I am absolutely certain that if he is successful, in 90 minutes everyone on this island will die.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Alright, I'm in. I'm in.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: Thank you. Come, come quickly.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: So, these Others, you think they're left over from the DHARMA folk?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: I don't know, man.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: My theory, they're aliens. That's why they use the fake beards—their heads are made of pathetic.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: Prosthetic, dude.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: You can't even spell and now you're correcting me? What do you think, Freckles?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: Just keep moving, we're being followed.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE:  Just keep smiling. There's at least two of them across the river. In about 5 seconds I'm going to turn the tables on them. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: Wait a second.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: You in?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: He's getting away!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: He's dead. We have to find the other one.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: No!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: I'm going. Sawyer.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: I said no!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: Are you crazy?! We let him go they'll know we're coming! He'll...
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: It doesn't matter if we catch him now!  They've already been warned.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: What do you mean "warned"?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: Why don't you tell them, Michael?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: I don't know what you're talking about.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: Stop lying! Tell them.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: Tell them what?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK:  I know what you're doing, Michael! Now tell them the truth! Tell them!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: It was the only way. They gave me a list.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: What list?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: It had your names on it. I had to bring all 4 of you back, or they said I'd never see my son again!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: Who are they?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: It's like I said—they live in a camp with huts. I swear, that's it.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: You let Henry go?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: Did you kill them? Ana Lucia and Libby? Did you?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: I had to, man. I, God, I couldn't find any other way. And Libby was a mistake. I, I didn't have time to think.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: But if you did have time—you still would have killed her, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: I'm sorry. You understand—I am sorry. I'm sorry. I—my son!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: I'm going back.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: No, Hurley. Hurley, you can't!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: We're all going to get killed and you knew it! You let us come anyway.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: It's too late to go back now, Hurley. We already caught them following us once. If they don't believe that we trust Michael, they'll kill us all! I'm sorry that I didn't say anything. But you have to know that I would never bring you out here if I didn't have a plan.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER: What plan?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JIN: Sayid! Here.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAYID: That's the rock Michael described. We're here.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: Hurry, please.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Hurley showed me. It's around here somewhere. It's definitely around, uh...
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: We're running out of time, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Here it is! Told you. Careful. Careful. Dynamite is very unstable. You don't want to end up like Dr. Arzt.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Careful. Eko, hey, Eko. Listen, what if we hurt them? Or blow up the computer?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: You can leave now, Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: John, it's Charlie. Let's work this thing out, John. John! Eko is very upset, John. Just open this door and we can talk about it. John, you should know Eko is going to blow open the blast door.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Blow it open with what?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: With dynamite from the old ship in the jungle.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: It would take an atom bomb, brother. Tell him not to bother.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: You're sure it'll hold?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Aye, I'm sure.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Maybe you should do it?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Come on, Des, you've seen me do it a hundred times.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: How do you even remember where you left off from?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Slowly, Des. Very, very slowly. You should have seen Radzinsky do this. He had a photographic memory. I mean, this whole baby was his idea.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Yeah, right, Radzinsky. Radzinsky figured out how to fake a lockdown. Radzinsky created this great invisible map. More and more tales about your former partner. Yet for some reason, you never want to tell me what bloody well happened to him.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: See that brown stain, there? That's Radzinsky. He put a shotgun in his mouth when I was asleep. The bitch of it was, I only had a 108 minutes to bury the poor bastard.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Well, if you don't want me to go crazy, next time let me go out.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Well, you want to go out there with the quarantine and the hostiles?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I haven't been outside for 2 bloody years! Yes, I want to go! I was in the army for God's sake!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Oh, right, Her Majesty's Army, correct? Tell me, Desmond, why'd you leave that nice old lady's army? Oh, I remember now. You got kicked out because you couldn't follow orders.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Why did you leave your army, Kelvin, huh?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Because men followed my orders. Ah, but then thank God I joined the DHARMA Initiative. Namaste, thank you, and good luck. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Please, Kelvin. Let me go out, huh? Just once.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Sorry, Des. You stay here. You push the button. That's an order.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: John! Seriously, you're about to be detonated.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE:  Hey, what if John's right. What if it's just some colossal joke? You know, it's just some old computer connected to nothing? Maybe it's just a bunch of wires?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: Is that a joke?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: I'll see myself out.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: John, this is your last time to end this. Open the door, and I will forgive you.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Forgive me for what?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Hey, hey, Eko. Wait. Just wait a second. I don't think it's a good idea, Eko.  We're in a very confined area.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Oh, bollocks.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Kelvin! Hey, Kelvin.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What is this?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: This is the only other way out, partner.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Failsafe. Turn this key and this all goes away.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What's behind that wall, Kelvin? Huh? What was the incident?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Electromagnetism, geologically unique. The incident—there was a leak. So now the charge builds up and every time we push the button it discharges it before it gets too big.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Why make us do it—push the button? If we, if we can just...
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN:  Here's the real question, Desmundo—do you have the courage to take your finger out of the dam and blow the whole thing up, instead?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I think your friends just blew themselves up, brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: They're not my friends.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I can't hear anything. Maybe we should open it.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: No, no; it's a trick.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: A trick? They could be hurt! Is your doctor around?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Our doctor is God knows where. And he sure as hell doesn't care about anything happening down here.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Can I ask you a question, brother?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Absolutely.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Is the reason you're letting that clock there run all the way down to the very last tick—is it because you need to look down the barrel of a gun to find out what you really believe, John?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: I looked down the barrel of the gun and I believed. I thought it was my destiny to get into this place. And someone died—a kid. Because he was stupid enough to believe that I knew what I was talking about. And the night that he died for nothing, I was sitting right up there, all alone, beating my hand bloody against that stupid door—screaming to the heavens asking what I should do. And then a light went on. I thought it was a sign. But it wasn't a sign. Probably just you going to the bathroom.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: Jack.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: What are they?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: It's handwritten. It's all filled, the whole book. They're journal entries.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE:  0400: S.R. moves ping-pong table again. 0415: Takes a shower. What is this?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER:  Hey, Doc, what did you say Sayid's signal's going to be when the coast is clear to hit that beach party?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: That means he found them, right?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: That's miles from here.  Where were you taking us?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: Sayid said that he'd light the signal so that we could meet him at the shore. Why aren't we going to the beach?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: We are headed to the beach.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: We're nowhere near the beach!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: Look, I had to.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: What?!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE: Sawyer!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 JACK: Run!!! Go, go!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: Wait!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Tell me about this other hatch you found—this Pearl.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: What do you want to know?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Details.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: The Pearl is a psychological station full of TV monitors. And two men sat in viewing chairs and filled notebooks with observations on what happens in here. And then they put the notebooks in pneumatic tubes and send them back to their headquarters so they could evaluate us—as an experiment.  What?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What if you've got it backwards?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Backwards?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What if the experiment wasn't on the two men in here, but on the two men in there? I want to see that tape, John.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: No, you can't. There's no way to see it down here.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Well, was there anything else in that station? Was there a computer?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: So what did it do?!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Nothing! It didn't do anything. It printed out numbers. Lots and lots of numbers.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What printout, where is it?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Here, reading material for the next 19 minutes. Knock yourself out.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: You've been shaving everyday for the last 3 years. You need to live a little, let go.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I'm never going to let go, brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN:  Oh, that's the spirit. Bye, Des.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Goodbye?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Yeah, goodbye. See you in a couple hours.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN:  Well, gosh, I didn't think you had the stones to come after me. I was a spook for 10 years, Des. I know when I'm being followed.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What are you doing with my boat?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: I'm fixing it.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: You were leaving?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Well, I mean, not yet. It's still about a week away. You wrecked it pretty good, Des. What do you think? Want to come with me?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Come where?! What about the button?!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Screw the button, man. Who knows if it's even real?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: That's not what you said when you were going on and on about dams and electromagnetics and failsafes!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Well, I was drunk.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Why did you lie to me?!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: I lied to you because I needed a sucker to save the world after I left!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: You crazy old bastard! You stole my life!!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 INMAN: Oh, come on.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: What else did you lie to me about?! What else? Tell me?!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: How could you do this to me?! Get up.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Oh my God. Oh my God.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: When did you come here?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: The Island—when did you come here? How long ago?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: 60-65 days.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: The date—what was the date?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: September 22nd.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: It was September 22nd.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I think I crashed your plane.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 SAWYER:  Son-of-bitch...
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MR. FRIENDLY: Everybody just calm down.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 KATE:  It's fake. I know that your beard is fake.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MR. FRIENDLY: Sorry, missy, I didn't get you.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MS. KLUGH: She says she's knows your beard's fake, Tom.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MR. FRIENDLY:  Well, thanks for pointing that out, Kate. I can't tell you how much this thing itches. And thanks for telling them my name, Bea.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 GALE: Hello again.  Where's your beard?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MR. FRIENDLY: I think they know.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 GALE:  Alright, let's take care of business, shall we?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Eko? Eko! It's Charlie. Wake up.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: We need to push the button.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: No, we don't!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: Do you not hear me, brother? I crashed your bloody plane?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: How did you manage to do that?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: On that day, those numbers turned to hieroglyphics. And when the last one came down this whole place started to shake! And that screen? That screen filled up with "system failure,"  System Failure! And I know what they are. 92204—September the 22nd, 2004, the day your planed crashed! It's real! It's all bloody real!! Now, push the damn button!!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: I know what I saw! It's a lie; it's not real! None of it is real!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: You don't want to push the button? Then I will.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: No!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: You killed us. You killed us all.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: No. I just saved us all.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Hey, Eko, wake up.  Hey, can I get some help? Can you help me?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I'm trying, brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 PENELOPE: Dearest Des, I am writing this letter to you as you leave for prison. And I've hidden in the one place you would turn to in a moment of great desperation. I know you go away with the weight of what happened on your shoulders. And I know the only person who can ever take it off is you. Please don't give up, Des. Because all we really need to survive is one person who truly loves us. And you have her. I will wait for you. Always. I love you, Pen.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: It's all gone. It's all gone!!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE:  I've done everything you wanted me to do? Why did you do this?! Why?!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: 3 days before you came down here, before we met, I heard a banging on the Hatch door, shouting. But it was you, John, wasn't it? You said there isn't any purpose—there's no such thing as fate. But you saved my life, brother, so that I could save yours.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: No, no, no, none of this is real! Nothing is going to happen. We're going to be okay.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I've got to go. And you've got to get as far away from here as possible.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Go where?! Stop!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I'm going to blow the dam, John.  I'm sorry for whatever happened that made you stop believing. But it's all real. Now I've got to go and make it all go away.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: Wait, Desmond.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND: I'll see you in another life, brother.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Eko! Eko! Wake up! Can you move? Okay, come on.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Eko, on your feet.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: Charlie.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: No.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 EKO: John!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 LOCKE: I was wrong.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 PENELOPE: All we really need to survive is one person who truly loves us. And you have her. I will wait for you. Always. I love you.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 DESMOND:  I love you, Penny.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 BERNARD: Charlie, are you okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: It's hard to tell exactly. But, my ears, you know?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 BERNARD: Where's Locke—Eko?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: They're not back yet?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 GALE: I'm not happy about the arrangement that was made with you Michael, but we got more than we bargained for when Walt joined us, so I suppose this is what's best. And you let me go, set me free—you lived up to your word. We live up to our word, too. Do you know how to drive a boat?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: Yeah, I can drive a boat.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 GALE: Good, then you're going to take this boat and follow a compass bearing of 325, and if you do that exactly, you and your son will find rescue.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: That's it? I follow the bearing and me and my son get rescued?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 GALE: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: How do you know I won't tell people about where I was?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 GALE: Maybe you will, maybe you won't. But it won't matter. Once you leave, you'll never be able to get back here. And my hunch is you won't say a word to anybody because if you do, people will find out what you did to get your son back.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: My friends—I was promised you wouldn't hurt them.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 GALE: A deal's a deal.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: Who are you people?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 GALE: We're the good guys, Michael. Alright, she's all yours.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: What? What, am I stupid? Where's my son?!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 GALE: Walt's inside.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 GALE: Bon voyage, Michael.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: Walt!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 WALT: Dad! Dad!
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: Come here, come here . You okay?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 WALT: Yeah.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MICHAEL: You sure? Okay, I've got you now. It's going to be okay now. We're going home, Walt. We are going home.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MS. KLUGH: Hugo, you can go back to your camp.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MS. KLUGH: Go back. Your job is to tell the rest of your people they can never come here.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 HURLEY: But what about my friends?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 GALE: Your friends are coming home with us.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MS. KLUGH: Go.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CLAIRE: What happened out there, Charlie?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: You want to hear the part about me nearly being killed by the flaming fireball—or the flying fork?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CLAIRE: I want you to be serious.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Nothing happened.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CLAIRE: Well, something happened. I mean that noise, and the sky turned that weird violet color.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Did it?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 CHARLIE: Ow, ow.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MAN #1: Quem quebrou isso, hein?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MAN #2: Não se preocupe. Tá quebrado. Destruí sua defesa. Essa será sua última vez que verá "o" torre. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MAN #1: Parte do plano, meu amigo. Tudo parte do plano. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MAN #2: Ah, então seu plano deve ser perder. Agora, por favor. 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MAN #2: O quê? 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MAN #1: Há quanto tempo tá fazendo isto? 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MAN #1: É isso, não é? A gente não percebeu de novo. Eles vão matar a gente! 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MAN #2: Fica quieto! Nós não o perdemos! 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MAN #1: Fala! Fala de novo que não é um alarme falso. Fala, fala de novo. Fala que eu... 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MAN #2: Cala a boca e chama ajuda!! 
Lost.Season02.Episode23 PENELOPE: Hello.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MAN #1: Ms. Widmore?
Lost.Season02.Episode23 PENELOPE: Yes.
Lost.Season02.Episode23 MAN #1: It's us. I think we found it.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: I burnt my hand -- and my muffins.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 AMELIA: Still hasn't fixed your plumbing yet?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 WORKER GUY:  It's a work in progress.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 ADAM: It's not even literature. It's popcorn.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 AMELIA: And why isn't it literature, Adam? I'm dying to know.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 ADAM: There's no metaphor. It's by-the-numbers religious hocum-pocum.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 AMELIA: No metaphor?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 ADAM: It's science-fiction -- now I know why Ben isn't here.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Excuse me?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 ADAM: I know the host picks the book; but seriously, Julie, he wouldn't read this in the damn bathroom.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Well, Adam, I am the host and I do pick the book. And this is my favorite book. So I am absolutely thrilled that you can't stand it. Silly me for sinking so low as to select something that Ben wouldn't like. Here I am thinking that free will still actually exists on--
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: The doorway -- get into the doorway.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: Goodwin, did you see where the tail landed?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GOODWIN: Yeah, probably in the water.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: You run and you can make that shore line in an hour. Ethan, get up there to that fuselage. There may actually be survivors; and you're one of them. A passenger -- in shock -- come up with an adequate story if they ask. Stay quiet if they don't. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in 3 days. Go.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: So I guess I'm out of the book club.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK:  Kate! Kate, can you hear me?! Kate!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 TOM: Rise and shine, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KATE: Where am I?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 TOM: You don't really think I'm going to answer that, do you?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KATE: Where are Sawyer and Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 TOM: I'll tell you what, why don't you just take a nice hot shower -- wake yourself up -- wash the day off you and start fresh. There's a nice clean towel, soap, shampoo...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KATE:  I'm not showering in front of you.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 TOM:  Kate, you're not my type.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER: Hey.  Where are we? Who the hell are you? Oh, you ain't gonna talk to me? What -- you got more important things to do?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KARL: I wouldn't do that.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER: If I want your advice -- I'll ask for it.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER: Son-of-a-bitch!!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KARL: Told you.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 UNKNOWN VOICE: Stop that.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Hi, Jack. I'm Juliet.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Hi, I'm Jack Shephard. I'm here...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SARAH:  Where's your lawyer?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK:  You look pretty.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SARAH: Where's your lawyer?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: I fired him. Sarah, I'm sorry for, for pushing us to this place. I know that I...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SARAH: Excuse me; I'm sorry.  Yeah, um, no not yet. He just got here.  I'll call you when I get home.  Jack, I'm going to say this as simply as I can...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: What's his name?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SARAH: Jack, stop it.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: I'm not going to stop it. I'm going to keep asking you that until you tell me.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SARAH: No, I don't ask you what you do in your...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Just tell me what his name is! I want to know who he is. Look, you can have everything -- the cars, the house -- I don't care. I just -- I just want to know the name of the man that is with my wife.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET:  Jack, can you hear me in there?  Is that a yes?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Where are my friends?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Come down from the table first.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: You want me to come down -- come in here and get me down.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: If you want to talk, I'm happy to...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Tell me where my friends are!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: I will -- if you let go of the chain.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: You think I'm stupid?!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: I don't think you're stupid, Jack. I think you're stubborn.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KATE:  Hey! Where are my clothes?!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 TOM:  Come on, Kate. He's waiting.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: Sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to put those on, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KATE: And if I don't?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: Then you don't get any coffee.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: A little tighter.  Please.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KATE: What did you do with Sawyer and Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: Now why Sawyer?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KATE: Why Sawyer what?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: He's the first one you asked about. "What did you do with Sawyer and Jack?"
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KATE: You don't know me.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: Of course I don't.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KATE: I want my clothes back.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: We burned them.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KATE: Why did you bring me here? Why did you make me put on this dress? Why are you feeding me breakfast?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: I brought you here so you'd look out at the water and feel comforted -- comforted that your friends were looking out at the same ocean. I gave you the dress so that you'd feel like a lady. And I wanted you to eat your food with a real live fork and feel civilized. I did all those things so that you'd have something nice to hold on to. Because, Kate, the next two weeks are going to be very unpleasant.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Yeah, hi. Uh, I met a woman on the train. Sarah. And she dropped her cell phone and I don't even know her last name. But your number was in her phone so I was just wondering... I'm sorry, forget it.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Just give me a minute, Dad.  I asked you to give me a minute here.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN:  What's this? Why are you dialing all the numbers on Sarah's cell phone?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK:  Because one of them is him.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN: You've got to stop this, Jack. It's over.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Not until I know his name -- where he works, where he lives, when they first kissed. I want to know what it is about him.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Why is Sarah calling you, dad?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN: I think it's time that you let this go.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Why is she calling you?!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN: Because she was afraid -- for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK:  I want to know exactly why the hell she was calling...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN: She could see that you were slipping -- you were losing your grip.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: My grip is not the problem here!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN: Which is exactly what's happening here! Jack, I think I know a little something about being obsessive.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: No, being a drunk is not obsessive.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN:  Let it go, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK:  What? If you're trying to talk to me, I can't hear you.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: I know you're hungry. I brought this for you. This is how it will work. You sit there across from the door, back against the wall. I open the door and leave the tray. Can I trust you to do that, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: I don't want your food.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Well, it's a delicious sandwich...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: I want you to tell the guy who's trying to talk to me through that intercom that he can give it up.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Maybe you're hungrier than you think. That intercom hasn't worked in years.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK:  What's that for -- the button -- what's it for?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: It's for emergencies.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Who's watching me?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Are you going to sit against the wall so I can open the door?  It's just off the frying pan.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: You can have it.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: What do you do, Jack? What's your profession?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: I'm a repo man. You know, when people don't pay their bills I go in for the bank and I collect their possessions. I'm a people person so I really love it.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Are you married?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: No. I never saw the point. What about you? What's your job, besides making sandwiches?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Oh, I didn't make it. I just put the toothpicks in. When your plane crashed, where were you flying from?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Sydney.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: What were you doing there?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: I was bringing my father home.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Why would you go all the way to Australia just to...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Because he was dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK:  Yeah, I'm sure you are. Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: You can trust me, Jack. I'm not going to hurt you.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: What the hell is going on here?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KARL: Hey. Hey, how long would it take to get to your camp?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER: What, you talking to me now, Chachi?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KARL: From where they got you, how long a walk was it? A day, two days? And what are the people like from your plane?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER: Oh, they're just awesome.  Last one of you boys came for a visit got tortured by our Iraqi. He tortured me, too. But hell, he don't know any better.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER: Hey, how'd you get out of there?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KARL:  Run that way.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER: Hold on!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KARL: You run that way!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 TOM: Say it. Say it, Karl.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KARL: I'm sorry. Sorry, I involved you in my break out attempt.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: The drugs we gave you when we brought you here have a pretty serious side-effect -- dehydration. Your head is probably sore, your throat is raw. If you don't eat or drink something soon you're going to start hallucinating.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: So, you're a doctor, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: No, I'm a repo woman. No strings attached. You don't have to answer any questions. You don't have to do anything but sit with your back up against the far wall. Let me open that door, put the plate down and leave. I know it feels like you're giving up, like you're losing, if you do anything that I ask you to. But you're not. You need to eat. What do you say?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Thank you, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK:  Let's take out the epidural catheter and get him started on a PCA.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 NURSE: You sure he's ready to self-administer his pain meds?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 NURSE: Dr. Shephard...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN: Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Give me your cell phone.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN: What? What?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: I want to see it. Now.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN: Look where you are, Jack. I mean, just look around you, please.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Give me the phone.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN: This is not the place for this.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 MODERATOR: You must be Jack. Why don't you grab a chair and join us?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: You know me?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 MODERATOR: Yes, your father's told us all about you.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Yeah, what's he told you about me? What did you tell them about me, dad? That your son never really had it -- not like the old man. I didn't have the will to make it work? My life, my job, my marriage. What did you tell them about my marriage, dad?!! You want to know how he manages his marriage? A bottle of scotch every night before dinner.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 MODERATOR: Your father has been sober 50 days now. We're very proud of that.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK:  Wow, dad, I wonder what helped you turn that corner? Do you think maybe it was a new lady friend? Do you think maybe that's what...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN: I will not let you you talk to me...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: I will not let you sleep with my wife.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 CHRISTIAN: Oh, Jack. Jack, I'm your father. Jack, please just let it go.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Which way out?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Don't do this, Jack. Don't. Don't.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Open the door.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: No. I can't. I can't, Jack. I do that -- we die. I'm not. I'm not.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Open the door!!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: I can't! I swear I can't!!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE:  She's telling the truth, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: I swear to god, I will kill her.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: Okay. Have her open the door and she dies anyway. We all do.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Jack, over here!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: The button!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: The yellow button, the button!!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER:  Oh, come on. Unbelievable.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 TOM:  Keep moving.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 TOM: Stick your arms out through the bars; I'll take off your cuffs. They scratched you up pretty bad, didn't they? I'll bring you some anti-septic later.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER: How about you bring me an ottoman? While you're at it I could use a blow dry.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 TOM: Hey, you got yourself a fish biscuit. How'd you do that?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER: I figured out your complicated gizmos, that's how.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 TOM:  Only took the bears 2 hours.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER:  How many of them were there?  You okay, Freckles?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KATE:  Yeah. You?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER: Just swell. I requested that cage, but whatever. Nice dress.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 KATE: They made me wear it.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SAWYER: You hungry?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: It's an aquarium.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Excuse me?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: This thing's for what -- sharks?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Dolphins, too.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: We're underwater, aren't we?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Is this one of their stations -- the DHARMA Initiative?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: They called it the Hydra.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: So you people are just whatever's leftover of them.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Well, that was a long time ago. It doesn't matter who we were. It only matters who we are. We know exactly who you are, Jack Shephard.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: You don't know anything about me.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: We know that you're a spinal surgeon based out of St. Sebastian's Hospital in Los Angeles. I know that you went to Columbia and that you graduated med school a year faster than anyone else. I know that you were married only once and that you contested the divorce. I know your father died in Sydney. I know this because I have a copy of his autopsy report.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: How did you get...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: We got it.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK:  What is that?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: This, Jack, is your life.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Do you -- is it just about me or is it about my family, too -- my friends.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: It's pretty much about everything.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Do you know about my -- about my ex-wife.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Sarah. Yes, Jack, we know all about her. What would you like to find out?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GUARD:  Shephard, someone posted your bail.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: How'd you, uh...
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SARAH: Your dad told me you were here. I called you a cab. So, um, goodbye. 
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK:  Sarah!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SARAH: What?!
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Is that him? 
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SARAH: What difference does it make?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: It just does.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SARAH: It's not going to change anything.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Look, I want to know! I need to know who he is.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 SARAH: It doesn't matter who he is. It just matters who you're not. Jack, your father -- he called me to help you. He was so drunk I could hardly understand him. Look at the bright side. Now you have something to fix.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Jack. Jack. What would you like to find out?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JACK: Is she -- is she happy?
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Yes, Jack, she's very happy. Now, I'd like to bring you some food and water. But this time I need to know that you'll behave. Can I trust you, Jack? Put your back against the wall, please.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 GALE: Good work, Juliet.
Lost.Season03.Episode01 JULIET: Thank you, Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 이거 네가 그랬어? 선화야. 이 발레리나 네가 깨뜨린 거니? 그럼 누가 깨뜨렸어?  Did you do this? Sun -- did you break the ballerina?  Then who did?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 YOUNG SUN: 일하는 아줌마. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 네 말 대로 아줌마가 그랬다면 당장 조치를 취해야겠지. 내 말 알아듣겠니?   선, 누가 깨뜨렸지? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 YOUNG SUN: 일하는 아줌마가 그랬어요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK:  알았다. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN:  문 열어봐. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN:  괜찮아요, 그냥 입덧하는 거예요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 진수씨! 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 우리 가야해. 지금 당장! 사이드한테 얘기해.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: My husband says it's time to leave.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 그들은 오지 않을거야.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: He doesn't think Jack and the others are coming. It's been over a day since we lit the fire. They should be here by now.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: Jack knows we're out here. He's counting on our signal. Perhaps he's not able to see the smoke. If he's North of us, the mountains would block his view.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 우리가 보내는 신호를 보지 못한 것 같아요.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: We need to sail forward along the coast, clear the mountains, and start another signal fire.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 돛을 해변쪽으로 돌려서 다시 한 번 신호를 보내쟤요.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: No!
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: I told Jack I would light a fire. I'm not abandoning him.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 사이드 말은 우리가... 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 사이드?   사이드가 임신했어? 정신차려! 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: My husband thinks we have to do as he says because he's the only one who knows how to sail. But he's wrong. I can help you sail the boat.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JULIET: Are you feeling any better? I made the soup myself, but I won't take it the wrong way if you don't like it.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: You never made soup for me.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 COLLEEN: Am I interrupting something?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JULIET: Would it really matter if you were?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 COLLEEN: We have a situation -- Ryan radioed in -- the Iraqi found the decoy village.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: Good, it's what we wanted.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 COLLEEN: Ryan followed him back to the shore and they have a sailboat.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: How?!
Lost.Season03.Episode02 COLLEEN: I have no idea.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JULIET: So they have a boat -- sailing in circles will keep them busy.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 COLLEEN: They could find us.  Ben?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: I'm thinking. How quickly can you put together a team?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 COLLEEN: Within the hour.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: Then don't waste time talking to us.  Hey Colleen, I want that boat.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE: Nice alarm clock.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: I've woken up to worse.  Want half a fish biscuit?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: What's this?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: Lunch -- we're going to need you to keep up your strength.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: Is that right?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 COLLEEN: Danny, wait!
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: Hold up.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 COLLEEN:  They have a boat. (There's more whispering that's inaudible.)
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: Okay, be careful out there.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: What are you looking at?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN:  돛에가서 손 좀 보고 올게. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 진수씨, 당신 말을 듣지 않은 거 미안해요. 사이드가 보는 앞에서. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 그러니까 내 말을 처음부터 들었어야지. 당신은 그러면... 왜 왔어? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 당신이랑 떨어져 있기 싫어서 왔을 뿐이예요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JAE: What's wrong?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: What's wrong is I'm married.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JAE: Right. That.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 재혁 씨, 안 되요. 안 되겠어요. 미안해요. ]
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JAE: 선화 씨, 잠시만요. ]
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 재혁 씨, 너무 아름다워요. 전 이거 받을 수 없어요. 남편이 어디서 났냐고 물으면... 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JAE:  I don't want to share you anymore. Your English is excellent now. You can go to America.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JAE: Does anyone know you're...
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: No!
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JAE: 너네 뭐지? 내가 누군줄...  What are you doing here? Get out of my--
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JAE:  회장님, 제가 뭐라 말씀... 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 옷 입어. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: Alright, here's the jig -- see these rocks, here? That's where you two come in.  You're going to chop them loose.  And you're going to haul them out of here.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE: You expect me to work in this dress?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: Well, it's up to you? You can take it off if you want.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER:  How dare you?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: Now, if you need anything -- you raise your hand. You get 10 minutes for lunch.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER:  I got a question, boss.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: No questions.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: She got to ask a question.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: If you try to run off, you will be shocked.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: Shot?! We don't even get a warning?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: Shocked. I said, shocked. If you talk to each other you're going to be shocked. If you touch each other, you're going to be shocked. If you're slacking, you're going to get shocked. Matter of fact, if you do anything at all that pisses me off, you're going to get shocked. Okay? Let's get to work.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE: I'm not doing anything until I see Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: Now, that was a quarter charge. You got any more questions?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: As soon as you're able to walk -- the wheelbarrow's right over there.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 부르셨습니까, 회장님? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 들어오게. 앉지. 문제가 생겼네.  We have a problem.]
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 이 놈한테 내 것을 도둑 맞았어. 자네가 이 문제를 해결해주길 바라네. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 뭘 도둑맞으셨는데요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 그건 중요치 않아. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 알겠습니다. 다시는 그러지 못하게 전하겠습니다, 회장님.  I'll deliver a message.]
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 그 정도로는 부족해! 아예 없애버려!
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 그렇게 할 수 없습니다. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 할 수 없다니 무슨 소리야? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 회장님, 이건 제가 할 일이 아닌 것 같은데요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 자넨 내가 시키는 대로만 하면 돼! 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 그러면 더 이상 회장님 밑에서 일할 수가 없습니다. 그만두겠습니다. ]
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 누구 맘대로 그만둬! 이 놈이 날 망신시켰어! 자네는 내 딸과 결혼했지? 그러니까, 자네는 내 아들이나 다름없네. 내 망신이 바로 자네의 망신 아닌가? 난 자네가 나서서 우리 가족의 명예를 되찾아 주길 바라네. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 진수 씨, 여기 올라와 봐요.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: Why should there be a dock all the way out here?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: Others.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: The dock's decaying. It's overgrown. It looks like it hasn't been used in quite some time. Whoever built it -- they're not here now.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 누가 만든지 모르겠지만, 한동안 사용하지 않았대요.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: Let's bring the boat in. We'll tie it to the dock and build a fire on the beach. The visibility's excellent. Jack will be able to see us for miles around.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: Safe?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: Yes, Jin. Of course it's safe.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: Hey! Get back to work.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: Whatever you say, boss.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 ALEX: Hey, careful. Don't let them see you talking to me. Are they keeping you in the cages?  Did you see another guy in there with you -- about my age, named Karl?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE:  No. Just Sawyer and me.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 ALEX: You're not even supposed to be in that cage.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE: What are you talking about? Who are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 ALEX: Where'd you get that dress?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE: They gave it to me.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 ALEX: It's mine. You can keep it. It looks better on you anyway.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE: Wait.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: Are you having fun yet, Freckles?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE: Quit staring at my ass.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: Give me something else to stare at.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 PICKETT: Hey! Shut up!
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: Yes sir, boss.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID:  Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: What else can I do?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: Help your husband. We need as much wood as we can find.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN:  We're building quite a large fire.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: We have to make sure Jack will see the smoke.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: Why are you lying to me, Sayid?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: And what would you know about lying, Sun?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: You're putting our lives in danger. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: I'm fairly certain our friends have been captured. There are tracks all over the dock. They're fresh -- as recent as yesterday.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: You said this dock was abandoned.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: That would be part of the lying you mentioned.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: You're not building this fire for our people; you're building it for the Others.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: I suspect that when they see the smoke they'll send a scout party to investigate. By then it will be night. When they arrive, I'll ambush them. I'll take two of them hostage, and I'll kill the rest.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: Two?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: One to make the other cooperate.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: What do you need me to do?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to lie to Jin for another 20 minutes.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: Because once the fire is lit it will be too late to go back.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 이제 와요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 오늘 어땠어? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 그냥 그랬어요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 아버님이 오늘 이상한 말씀 하시던데? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 뭐요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 난생 처음으로 나를 아들이라고 부르셨어. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 갑자기 왜요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 아버님만의 상술이시지. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 그래서 당신 그 일 할 거예요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 해야 돼. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 당신이 그럴 필요 없어요. 하지 마요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 당신 생각처럼 그게 그렇게 쉽다고 생각해? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 우리 아무도 없는 곳으로 가서 처음부터 다시 시작해요. 우리 둘만 가서... 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 다시 시작? 우리가 도망가면 당신 아버지가... 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 아빠가 찾을 수 없는 곳으로 가면 되잖아요. 나도 당신이 그런 일 하는 거 너무 싫어. 당신도... 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 나도 너무 싫지만 이게 다 당신을 위해서야! 다 당신과 결혼한 대가겠지.  
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 나도 당신이랑 결혼해서 치른 대가가 있는 거 몰라요?   진수씨, 어디가요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 일하러 가. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: Gun.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: I don't think I understand.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 자기야. 나도 여기서 무슨 일이 일어나는지 다 알아. 이건 잭을 위한 신호가 아니고, 그놈들을 유인해서 죽이려고 하는 거지?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID:  What is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: He knows what we're doing. He knows it's a trap.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 서로 영어로 하면 모르는 줄 알지? 당신이 생각하는 것보다 나 잘 알아들을 수 있어.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: He says he understands English better than I think he does.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 나 다 알아.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: He knows I betrayed him.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: Gun.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID:  Can you handle one of these? It's an automat...
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 보트에 가서 기다려. 어서 가.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID:  I think you'd be safer on the boat.  Sun, if by chance they get past us -- there's another gun. It's inside the blue tarp beneath the galley counter.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: If they get past you, that means my husband is dead. And I won't care anymore.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: As I said, the gun is inside the tarp.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER:  Back off!
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JULIET: James!
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JULIET: Put the gun down. Right now.  Put the gun down.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JAE: 잠시만요! 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN:  내가 누군 줄 알아? 응? 내가 왜 여기 왔는지 알아? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JAE: 정말 미안합니다. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 내가 왜 왔는지 알면 뭘 할지도 알겠군. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JAE: 미안합니다. 미안합니다.  
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 넌 한국을 떠나. 내 말 알아듣겠지? 여길 떠나서 다시 돌아오지 마. 이름도 바꾸고 다시 새 인생을 살아. 만약 여기 왔다는 소리가 들리면 그 땐 넌 끝이야! 알았어? 이제 너는 이 세상 사람이 아니다. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID: I don't think they're coming.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: I want you to let me off this boat.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 COLLEEN: I can't do that.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: Why not?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 COLLEEN: It's not my decision to make.  Do you realize there are 5 of my friends up there?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: Lower your voice.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 COLLEEN: Okay. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: Stop; or I'll shoot.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 COLLEEN: No you won't, Sun. I know you, Sun-Hwa Kwon; and I know you're not a killer. But despite what you may think, I'm not the enemy. We are not the enemy. But if you shoot me, that's exactly what we'll become. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: Stop! I will -- I'll shoot you.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 네가 여기 있으면 안되겠다. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 아버지, 여긴 웬일이세요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 이 젊은이 아버지와는 사업 관계로 아는 사이다. 아마 베란다에서 뛰어내렸다지? 얼마나 치욕스러웠으면. 이제 그만 이제 남편이 있는 너의 집으로 돌아가. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SUN: 아버지. 진수씨한테 얘기하실 거예요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 MR. PAIK: 이제와서 무슨 소용이 있다고. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 당신이 없으면 내가 어떻게 살지 몰라.   당신하고 우리 아이. 
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAYID:  I'm sorry I dragged you into this. And please communicate to your husband that next time I will listen to him. We should go. We have a long walk ahead of us.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JIN: 가자.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE: Are you okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: Never better.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE: What the hell were you thinking?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: I couldn't help myself -- you just looked so damn cute swinging that pickaxe. Chain gang looks good on you, Freckles.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE:  Sawyer.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: Two of those guards got some real fight in them. The rest of them, I'm not so much worried about. That heavy-set guy -- he packs a hell of a punch. The shaggy-haired kid's got some kind of martial arts training, but I think I could take him if I had to. Oh, FYI -- those zapper things got a safety on them.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE:  Did you see the look on their faces when you got a hold of that rifle?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: I'm guessing most of these boys have never seen any real action. But that blond who had a gun pointed at you? She would have shot you -- no problem.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE: Why'd she call you James?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: Because that's my name. I noticed something else, too. You taste like strawberries.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 KATE: You taste like fish biscuits. So what do we do now?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: Well, Shortcake, now we wait for these bastards to make a mistake.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 SAWYER: Sooner or later, they're going to let their guard down. And when they do, we're going to be there to put them in their place.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: Hello, Jack.  You know what's crazy, Jack? A week ago, you and I were in exactly the opposite situation. I was the one locked up and you were the one coming in for visits. And I know that you were angry that I lied to you about who I was; but, hell, do you blame me? I mean, let's face it, if I had told you I was one of those people that you and your friends have been calling Others all this time it would have been right back to Sayid and his -- fists. Wouldn't it?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JACK: What do you want from me?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: I want for you to change your at--perspective. And, the first step in doing that would be for me to be decent enough to introduce myself honestly, so --  Hi, my name is Benjamin Linus and I've lived on this island all my life.  You're not going to shake?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: Bring it in, please.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JACK: Where are Kate and Sawyer?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: They're fine; and they're close. That's all I'm able to tell you right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JACK: You can tell me anything you want.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: Fair enough. It's all I want to tell you. I'm going to make this really simple, Jack. If you cooperate; we send you home.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JACK: Cooperate with what?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: When the time is right, I'll tell you...
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JACK: You tell me now.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: Patience, Jack. Patience.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JACK: Home -- is that where you sent Walt and Michael?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JACK:  If you could leave this island why would you still be here?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: Yes, Jack, why would we be here?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JACK: You're lying. You're stuck here just like we are. You don't have any...
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: Your flight crashed on September 22nd, 2004. Today is November 29th. That means you've been on our island for 69 days. Yes, we do have contact with the outside world, Jack. That's how we know that during those 69 days your fellow Americans re-elected George W. Bush; Christopher Reeve has passed away; the Boston Red Sox won the World Series.  What?
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JACK: If you wanted me to believe this, you probably should have picked somebody else besides the Red Sox.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: No, they were down 3 games to none against the Yankees in the league championship, and then they won 8 straight.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 JACK:  Sure. Sure, of course they did.
Lost.Season03.Episode02 BEN: That's home, Jack. Right there, on the other side of that glass. And if you listen to me -- if you trust me -- if you do what I tell you when the time comes -- I'll take you there. I will take you home.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CLAIRE: When did John get back? And what's he doing? Where's he been? Where's everyone else? Don't you think you should go find out?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: So you're gone for a whole day after a massive hatch detonation -- you don't call, you don't write?  Sorry, am I interrupting something?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: What, you can't speak John? You're mute?  I am sorry about that. So where are Eko and Desmond? Are they off being mute and building structures, as well?  I know; you can't speak.  You need to speak? To me? What do you want to--?  Sand? You need to speak to the sand?  Trees? Yeah, I've heard they're wonderful conversationalists.  Hey! I don't understand! Who do you need to speak to?  Church? Sky?  Island?  Island? You need to speak to the island?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: I need your help? Since when do you need my help?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: I need you to stand guard? Oh yeah, so you can talk to the island. Dangerous. Well, amusing as the mute game invariably is, you are aware, John, that I detest you, aren't you? You do remember repeatedly punching me in the face and accusing me of using heroin when I was not.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: What the sodding hell is a sweat lodge?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Where you headed?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Eureka.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I can get you as far as Bridgeville. Come on, hop in. Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: My name's John.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Eddie.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Hi, Eddie.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Nasty day to be hitching.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: That's for sure.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: You don't mind my asking -- what's in Eureka?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: I heard there was some work there cutting timber.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Oh, is that what you do?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: That might be what I do. I don't know. All I know is I had to get out of where I came from. Mom's dead. Dad's a drunk.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Hey look at that, the rain is passing.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: What, did you rob a bank?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE:  Afraid so.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 SHERIFF: Can I see license and registration, please?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Was I speeding, officer?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 SHERIFF: Tail light's out. Can you both please step out of the vehicle?  What you got back here?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Guns and groceries.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Now, the transactions logs and the paperwork for all of them is in the red notebook right there in that duffel.  So are we free to go?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 SHERIFF: I could still take you in for picking up a hitchhiker.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: That's my uncle. I called him. He picked me up.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 SHERIFF: Get out of here. 
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: So what is with all the guns, uncle?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: What's that? You're not taking drugs are you, John? I only ask because of the strict zero tolerance policy you've enacted, and I wouldn't want you to have to start punching yourself in the face.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 ].
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Yeah, I know, I get it. You're going to go in your little magic hut and I'm going to stand out here in case you devolve into a monkey.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Don't come in -- okay. Okay, I get it.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 BOONE: Hi, John. It's good to see you again.  What's that, John?  Oh, you're sorry. That's okay. I was the sacrifice the island demanded.  Don't worry; you'll speak when you have something worth saying. I'm here to help you find your way again. So you can bring the family back together. Come on, I want to show you something.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 BOONE:  John, you're going to need that.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 BOONE: John, someone in this airport is in serious danger. You are the only one who can save them.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 BOONE: Not them, they'll be fine -- for a while.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 BOONE: I think Sayid's got it.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 BOONE: Not Hurley.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 BOONE: Forget it. He's helping himself.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 BOONE: There's nothing you can do for them. Not yet. First you have to clean up your own mess.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 BOONE: Come up here, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 BOONE: Clean it up, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 BOONE: They've got him. You don't have much time.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: John! What happened? Are you alright?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I'm going to save Mr. Eko's life.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Eko's cross.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: He was dragged this way.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Dragged? By what?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: By a polar bear.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Sawyer killed the polar bear.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: He killed a polar bear.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: What's that, John? Blood?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I'm going to go on alone, Charlie. You go back to Claire.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Well, I'll take my chances.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: You don't want to go with me, Charlie. Bad things happen to people who hang around with me.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE:  Hey, Bobby.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE:  What's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: That, Eddie, is our sweat lodge.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: A what?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Anybody who wants can go in there, light a fire, get it nice and hot -- meditate.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Then what?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: And then you're supposed to figure out what to do with your life -- you know, what direction to take -- go on in there and figure out if you're a farmer or a hunter.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: So, which are you, John?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Hey, Mike, Jan, this is Eddie. He's looking for some logging work, but I convinced him to come home and have some supper with us first.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: Nice to meet you, Eddie.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Nice to meet you.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 JAN: Any friend of John's is a friend of ours.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: John's a very special guy.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 JAN: Grab a spot.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE:  So, you like Geronimo Jackson, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Uh, yeah, yeah, they're alright. It's one of my dad's old shirts.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: Your dad has excellent taste.  Listen up, people. John brought a guest to supper. So everyone, this is Eddie . Eddie, this is everyone.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Nice to meet you.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: John, you want to say some grace?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Yeah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for the food and the friends. And thanks for the rain today so that Adam will stop grumbling about the drought . And for me, thank you for helping me stop being so angry. And for helping me find a real family -- because they're a hell of a lot better than the one I used to have. So, let's eat. Amen.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 JAN: Amen, let's dig in.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE:  Thank you. Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Is that the hatch?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: What's left of it.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Looks like it imploded.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: What's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: It's an active kill -- meaning that whatever was eating this is going to be back for more.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: If you want to say polar bear you can just say it.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE:  Alright, polar bear.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Run!
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: Dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: They kept Jack, Kate and Sawyer. And they sent me back to tell everyone else that we can't ever go over there. Oh, and that dude we had in the hatch, Henry -- he was there. He's, like, their leader.  So, what do we do?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Do what they told you. Go back to the camp and tell the others.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: You're not going to do anything?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I am doing something. Go back to the beach, Hugo.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: Wait, where are you guys going?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: The island told Locke he has to save Eko.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: Save him from what?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Well, apparently, a bear's got him. It's just made an active kill. You may want to hustle.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: Bear? What bear?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: What's that? More fur?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: This way.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: You know, when I used to get high, I'd watch nature programs on the Beeb. Polar bears are meant to be quite clever. Very clever. They're like the Einsteins of the bear community.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: She likes you, man.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: She does not.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Oh, yeah, she does.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: She does not.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Yeah, she does.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: She's, like, half my age, man. You'd be better off with her.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Uh-uh, no. Lizzy's too granola for me. What she really wants is a daddy -- like everyone else here. You should take advantage of that.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: That's not really funny, Eddie.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: It was a joke. It was a joke. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: How come you never talk about your dad, John?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Nothing worth talking about.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: What's going on in that greenhouse over there? Maybe they need a hand with that fertilizer?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: No, no, no, no. They're okay. They're okay. Come on, we've got orchard duty.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: What's the big secret, John?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: The greenhouse -- what have you guys got in there? What are you hiding? Because every time I go near it, you and just about everyone else acts all weird.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Look, you're a guest here. These things take time.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: I've been here for 6 weeks.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Eddie, nothing's--
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: I'm not blind, man. Did you forget you had a duffel bag full of guns when you brought me here?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Mike and Jan welcomed you here with open arms. They feed you. They give you a place to stay.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: And Mike and Jan fold their hands every night before chow and talk about how we're family. But your family's got too many secrets. Now, I see the fertilizer going into that greenhouse. I know what's going on, and I want in.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: In on what?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Whatever you guys are trying to blow up.  What's so funny?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I'll talk to Mike and Jan.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: You really think Eko's in there? Let's hurry up and do this, maybe the bear's out finishing his lunch.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: You're not going in there, Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I'm going to do this alone.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: You don't get to tell me what I can't do. If I want to go in there, I'll go in there.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Why do you want to go in there?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: I don't need a reason!
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Then go back.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: You go back. You don't have a good reason to go in there either.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I'm going in there because I'm supposed to go in there.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: If it all goes to plan, we probably won't even see the bear, will we?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: And hopefully, he won't smell us. 
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Hairspray? Now, I hate to be the one to point this out to you...
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE:  It's not for me.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: Bear? Is that you? Who's there?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 DESMOND: You alone, brother?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: Uh, yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: Whoa! Dude! I'm not alone.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 DESMOND: Beach camp's right over there. Can you get me some clothes?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: What happened to yours?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 DESMOND: I woke up in the jungle like this.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: So, like, the hatch blew off your underwear?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 DESMOND:  Fine, you want to discuss this in great detail right now?! Let's do it.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: No, no, that's okay. I've got something in here.  How do you feel about tie-dye?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Hey Kim! Hey, Mike and Jan in?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 KIM: Yeah, they were looking for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Good, good. Good timing then, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 KIM:  Go on in.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: Got all the cash?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 JAN: In the bag.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: What bag?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 JAN: The one with the money in it!
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: What about the bank records?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 JAN: Leave them.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: Shouldn't we sort out what they can trace?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 JAN: There is no time, Mike.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE:  What's going on?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 JAN: What does it look like?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I don't...
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: You screwed up, John. You blew it, big-time.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE:  What are you -- what? What are you doing? Are you leaving? Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 JAN:  That is why, you idiot!
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: John, your friend's a cop.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: Do you know how much jail time we'd get for this much weed?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 JAN: Nice picture, huh? Got him fresh out of the academy.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: No -- that -- he was hitchhiking. He told me he was going to Eureka. How could he possibly--?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 JAN: He was waiting for you, John! He has been here for 6 weeks gathering evidence because you brought him here.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Mike, that's impossible.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: He played you for a sucker. Now it's over.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: No, wait. No, wait, wait. Stop! We don't know what he's told them. He hasn't even been in here yet. If he's still gathering evidence and trying to make a case then it's not too late.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 JAN: Not too late for what?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: To protect us. To protect all of us. It's not too late to fix this. I can fix this.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 MIKE: How are you going to do that, John? Huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Eko!
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EKO: John.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Is he okay? Is he alive? Is he alright?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: He's alive.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Turn him over. Turn him over.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Charlie, we've got to get out of here.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Okay, let's get him up.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: So, when you say "turn the key" you mean like key, key?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 DESMOND: It was a failsafe key.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: That seems kind of convenient.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 DESMOND: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: I'm just saying, if you had this magic key the whole time why didn't you, like, use it?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 DESMOND: I didn't know what would happen.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: So what did happen?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 DESMOND: The failsafe key must have detonated the electromagnetic anomaly -- made the hatch implode.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: You didn't implode.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 DESMOND: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: You're not going to, like, turn into the Hulk, or something.  So is that what made the blender noise? And the sky turn purple?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 DESMOND: I'm afraid I missed that, brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: Right, you were failsafing. Well, FYI, the whole island vibrated. And Kate and Jack and Sawyer saw it, too, right before they got bags pulled over their heads.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 DESMOND: Don't worry. Locke's going to go after them. He said so in his speech.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: What? What speech? All he said was he was going to go save Eko and kill bears.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 DESMOND: Right. Right, of course. I'm sorry. I'm just a bit shook up.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I burned that bear pretty good. I don't think he's going to be coming after us.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Now that we've survived this suicide mission are you going to tell me what you saw?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: What I saw?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: In the spirit tent.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I saw Boone.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Boone? What did he have to say for himself?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: He told me I had to clean up my own mess.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Well, dead as he may be, I agree with Boone. If you kept pushing that button like Eko told you to...
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: We wouldn't have had to save him in the first place. Yeah, Charlie, that's what cleaning up your own mess means.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Spoken like someone who's had a few too many messes to clean.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: No deer, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Nope.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: You talk to Mike and Jan yet?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Yeah, I sure did.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: What did they say?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: They said that I should bring you by the greenhouse tonight after supper and that they would explain everything.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Cool, that's great.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: What, did you see something?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: John?  What are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Did you know it would be me?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: In the truck? Did you know it would be me driving? Did they choose me?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: They? John, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I didn't load that one. So how about you just answer the question, Eddie?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Yeah, they chose you, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Because you hadn't been here long, didn't have a criminal record, and psyche profiles said you would be amenable for coercion.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Amenable for coercion?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: Hey! Lower the gun, John. Okay? This isn't personal.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: What's not personal?!
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Stop. Stop.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: I'm sorry, John, but you're not going to shoot me. You're not a murderer. You're a good man. You're a farmer.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Nope. Not a farmer. I was a hunter. I'm a hunter.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EDDIE: I'm going to walk away now, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Hey, John? You hear something?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: It sounds like a stream.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Let's put him down -- maybe get some water in him.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: I'll go. You stay here. 
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE:  I'm sorry. Sorry I ever doubted you. Sorry I gave up on my faith in the island. I messed up. Now our people are captured -- if I'd just listened to you -- if I'd just let you keep pushing the button. I could have gone with them, protected them. I could have saved them.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EKO: You can still protect them. You can still save them.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I don't even know where they are.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 EKO: You will find them. After all, you are a hunter, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Did you say something?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: He's awake. Eko?  Eko?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Maybe we should just get him back, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: You alright?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: Yeah, just keep walking.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE:  Hey!
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CLAIRE: John? Charlie?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 PAULO: What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: We got him.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY:  Is he alive?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 NIKKI: We need Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE:  Take him in.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: Jack's not coming back. They've got him.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CLAIRE: What? What are you talking about, Hurley?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 NIKKI: Jack's gone? I don't understand. Okay, when were you planning on telling us this, Hurley?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 PAULO: What do you mean "they"? Who's "they"?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: They are the Others. And, yes, they've taken Jack, and Kate and Sawyer.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 PAULO: How? What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CLAIRE: What about Sun and Jin and Sayid? Are they okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 LOCKE: I don't know. I'm going to find our friends.  I don't know how yet, but I will. We're going to find them. All of them. And then we're going to bring them home. But first things first, we've got to look out for Mr. Eko. So, Paulo and Nikki, bring towels and water. Claire, we've got to clean him up so bring all the first aid supplies. 
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE:  Not a bad speech.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: Whoa.
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE: Whoa, what?
Lost.Season03.Episode03 HURLEY: I just got hit with, you know, deja vu. 
Lost.Season03.Episode03 CHARLIE:  Okay. Well, when that wears off can you get bandages from the kitchen?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 DESMOND: You've, um, you've got a problem with your roof.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CLAIRE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 DESMOND: Look, maybe you should move down the beach, just for tonight. That way I can fix it -- make some improvements.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CLAIRE: That's really nice of you to offer, but, um, Aaron just feel asleep so I should just...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 DESMOND: No, it'll be worth it. I promise.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CHARLIE:  Whatcha doing, brother?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 DESMOND: I was just offering to fix this roof here.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CHARLIE: Fine. If there's a problem I'll fix it. I'm quite handy. I was building a church before Eko exploded.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 DESMOND: Right, well, just trying to help, huh.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CLAIRE: Thanks.  What was all that about?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CHARLIE: I don't know. We're going to have to get that guy another button to push.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: How are you doing today, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK:  Great.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: You seem frustrated.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: Am I going to keep watching cartoons or are you going to tell me why I'm here?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: I hope you like blueberry. If not, I can...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: Should I talk to Benjamin?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: Should I talk to Benjamin? Because I'm starting to think that you're just the person who brings me my food.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: You can talk to him all you want. But he won't tell you anything.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: You work for him?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: No, I don't work for him.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: He's in charge?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Well, it doesn't work that way over here, Jack. We make decisions together.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: Really? Because when I was holding that broken plate at your neck he seemed happy to just let you die. I mean, it felt like he made that decision on his own.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: You don't know what you're talking about. I don't answer to him.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Juliet, I need you.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Can it wait?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: The sub is back. We have a situation, so come with me now.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT: Time for work.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Sound a little stuffy there, Chinatown. You need to blow your nose?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT: Just give me an excuse.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: I thought I just did. What do I got to do -- talk about your mother?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 VOICE: Danny, are you there?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT: Yeah?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 VOICE: 
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT: Hold on.  Okay, go.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 VOICE: 
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT: What? Where are they?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 TOM: She's hurt bad, Juliet.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Keep her steady.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT: She's going to be fine, right? She's going to be okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE:  What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: We happened.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Been on this rock long enough to realize they ain't in the business of shooting each other. We did it. Our team.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE:  You smiling?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Damn right I'm smiling. 'Cause we just got our ticket outta here.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: What are you doing?  Whenever you're ready to fill me in.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Shush up, I'm thinking.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: You know that chick they brought in on the stretcher -- that's broken nose man's girl.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: They call him Pickett.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Well, Pickett is distracted at the moment.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: So?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Watch and learn, little lady.  There's juice pumping into this box from somewhere. Next time someone comes to pull me out, I'm going to wait until they step in my little swimming hole, then I grab 'em. Zap! They fall back from the shock -- I snag the keys. Bet the bears never thought of that.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: You're both going to get electrocuted.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Yeah, but I felt the jolt. I can take it. The other guy -- he ain't going to be ready for it. What, you think I'm crazy?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: No, I'm actually impressed.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Well, wipe the stars out of eyes, sweetheart -- 'cause we're going to do this.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: So, what about Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What about him? We don't even know if he's here. Hell, we don't even know if he's alive. We gotta take care of us. It's every man for himself, Freckles.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 GUARD: Alright, Ford. That's enough.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PRISON TOUGH: The problem is I was following your hands, not your eyes.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: The problem is you old and dumb.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Who's the punching bag?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PRISON TOUGH: Just got here -- name's Munson. Rumor has it he ripped off the government for 10 mil, but they never found the money.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: I'll be damned.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PRISON TOUGH: If your buddy the warden didn't keep breaking up the fights, Munson would be a dead man.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: That son of a bitch.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: You get little mints on your pillow at night, too?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 MUNSON: Sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: You're here, what, a week? And you're on tote bag duty? I've been here 9 months; I'm still pushing trash.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 MUNSON: What does that mean?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: You think the warden's breaking up those fights because you're cute, Costanza? He's making a play for that 10 mil. First step -- butter you up, give you a plum job. Step two -- warden will reach out to your wife -- use her against you. Textbook con.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 MUNSON: And you're telling me this out of the kindness of your...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Advice is free, Murgatroyd. Last 9 months that warden's made my life a living hell. He gets that 10 mil you ain't got? I might just have to kill myself.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 WARDEN HARRIS: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Well, howdy, warden.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 WARDEN HARRIS: He bothering you, Munson?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: So what brings you to the sewing shop, Boss?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 WARDEN HARRIS: Don't think I can't extend your stay, Ford. All it takes is one call. One call.  How about you get that trash?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER:  Oh, yeah, the big kahuna.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Lunch already?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: What do you weigh?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: What do you weigh?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER:  180, give or take.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN:  How old are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: 32.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Don't lie.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER:  35.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN:  Good.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER:  Sayonora, sucker.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What did you do?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: We turned it off.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Sawyer!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Hey!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 TOM: 2 days since the sky turned purple. We've been blind. Our comms are all down -- I can't get them back up again. And in case you forgot, Colleen's in critical...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Juliet's taking care of her.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Where am I? What the hell are you doing to me? Let me up!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Jason.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Let me up!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JASON: Bite down on this please.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: You bite down on it.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: It's for the pain.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What?!! Wait! Let me up! No!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: God, I hate needles.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: No! What are you doing?!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JASON: No, you have to go through the sternum -- the sternum, like in the movie.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 MATTHEW: I know. I know.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: No!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 MATTHEW: 1, 2...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 DESMOND: Don't mind me, brother. I'm just going to take one of your clubs. Hurley said it would be alright.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PAULO: Hurley, huh? Does this mean you're off to save the day?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 DESMOND: So, uh, I can take one of these?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PAULO: Take the five iron; I never use it. That way when you die in the jungle, doing whatever you're doing, I don't have to go looking for it.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 DESMOND: Thanks, mate.  You know, you might want to square your shoulders a bit more.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PAULO: You play golf?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 DESMOND: I'm Scottish. Cheers. 
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What the hell?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Shhh.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN:  Hey. Hey, come on. Hey, move. Let's move. Hey, come on, come on, come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN:  Come on, come on, come on, come on. Let's move it. Let's move it. Let's move it. Hippity-hop. Hippity-hop. Hippity-hop.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Come on, what are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Let's move it. Let's move it. Let's move it. Let's move it.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What's your problem?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Come on, come on, come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Did you just kill that bunny?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: You know what a pacemaker is?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: They stick them in the tickers of people who've had by-pass work whose hearts need just a little jump -- a kickstart. The rabbit had a small pacemaker set to deliver its kickstart should it get too excited, or anxious, or frightened -- or should it try to escape.  Assuming you were telling the truth about your age and weight your resting heart rate should be about 70 beats per minute. Your active heart rate, however, that would be about 140 -- which is the point at which your pacemaker will cause your heart to explode. Which is how I know that you're going to start behaving now. The watch monitors your pulse. If you get within 15 beats of your danger zone it'll start to beep. If and when it beeps, you're going to want to relax yourself. Do some deep breathing, some yoga.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: If you want me dead, why don't you just shoot me and get it over with?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Because we're not killers, James. Oh, and one other thing -- Kate...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: You touch her, I swear...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: You tell her what we did, what we put in you -- that we're watching you -- you tell her any of these things -- we'll put one in her, too.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Sawyer? Sawyer, are you okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 TOM:  That's so you can clean yourselves up. And Kate, if any of that doesn't fit, just give me a holler, okay? 
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: What happened? What did they do to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Nothing, they just asked me questions. It ain't important.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Talk to me. What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Look, I told you. Nothing happened. So quit asking.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Turn around.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: What's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: It's just my watch. It's busted.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: When did you get a watch?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Look, I don't tell you everything! Just leave me alone, damn it. Put some clothes on.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CASSIDY: Hello, Sawyer.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: It's James Ford. And I know you know that because you got it right when you pressed charges.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CASSIDY: You're mad at me?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Well, look where I am.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CASSIDY: What did you want me to do? You conned me.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Something you want?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CASSIDY: Yeah. Yeah, there is.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Come on, I got license plates to make.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What's this?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CASSIDY: This is your daughter.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What do you want?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CASSIDY: Well, first I wanted you to know.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Then what? You think I'm going to take one look at this picture and turn into Father Knows Best?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CASSIDY: We're living in this little place in Albuquerque. It's near the University...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Why are you telling me this?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CASSIDY: I just thought you could write her a letter. Her name's Clementine.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What the hell am I going to write, "Dear Goo-goo, Ga-ga?" She's a baby. She ain't mine.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 CASSIDY: Sawyer, she is...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: I ain't got no daughter.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: I've been checking out my cage and I think if I climb to the top I can squeeze through those bars. They're spaced farther apart up there.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Don't bother.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: I'm talking about being smart. I think we should chill out here a while -- get the lay of the land.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 VOICE: Under control...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 ANOTHER VOICE: Yeah?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 VOICE:  ... it was a mistake bringing those two here.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: What did you do to Sawyer?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: I heard him yelling. You've got blood on your clothes.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Jack. Jack!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: What did you do to him?!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: It's not his blood.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: Then whose blood is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: It's the blood of a woman who's dying. Jack, I, I need your help.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: It's Jack. Jack!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Doc!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Jack!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Doc! Doc!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Jack!  Jack!!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Have you lost your mind? You bring him here?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: He's a doctor. He can help.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Well, this is not why...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Do you want her to die?  Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Gunshot wound to the abdomen.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Those aren't hers. Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT: What's he doing in here?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Danny, he's here to help.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT: Tell him who did this. He ought to know that.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Danny.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: I need him out of here.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Danny, get out.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 TOM: Come on, Danny. Let's go.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Go.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT: No way; she's my wife.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 TOM: Danny, they got it. 
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: I got the bullet out, but she's still bleeding.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: Right upper quadrant; it's swelling badly.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: No, I padded it.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: I need you to clamp under the liver so I can get a look back there.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET:  I'm not a surgeon.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: I know. But I need you to do this.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET:  Here.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: She's got a retro-hepatic caval bleed. It's behind the liver, that's why you missed it. I need lap pads -- as many as you got. Alright, another one.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: The crash cart, now. Juliet, I need paddles.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: It's broken. We've had... Jack, we haven't had anything happen before. We didn't -- we have -- I don't...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: Time of death ... she's gone.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT: They did this! They did this!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 TOM: Danny, wait. Danny, wait, no.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, Hoss. Take it easy.  Take it easy!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT:  Shut up!!  Do you love this guy?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT:  I said do you love him?!!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Stop!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT:  Do you love him?! Do you love him?!!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Leave him alone!!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT:  Do you love him?!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: What are you doing? Stop!!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT: Do  you  love  him !
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Yes! I love him!! I love him!! Please. 
Lost.Season03.Episode04 PICKETT:  Lock him up!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 MUNSON: I need to talk to you.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Sorry, I'm busy.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 MUNSON: It's important. Please.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 MUNSON: You were right. I loved her. I thought she -- I really thought she...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: 10 mil's a lot of greenbacks, Killer -- tends to change things. That's why you never get attached -- because once you care, that's when they can come at you.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 MUNSON: What did your's want? I saw you the other day with a woman. What did she want?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Something I ain't got. That all? You had yourself a good cry? You mind if I go back and see if George gets his farm?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 MUNSON: I need you to move it. The money.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: The money you didn't steal?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 MUNSON: We both know I did. Lila's hired a PI. She's going to find it. Do this for me. You have to.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: No. It's too dangerous. I'll be a walking target.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 MUNSON: If you don't help me the warden will get it all. He'll win. Please. Please.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Are you okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Dandy. Guy hits like a girl. No offense.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Why did he do that?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Hell if I know. These people ever make any sense to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What are you doing? What are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: What does it look like?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Hang on a second, Freckles.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: I told you, the time ain't right.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: You're the one that said we had to go.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Well, that was before...
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Before what?! I don't know what they did to you. But I know you're scared enough to lie about it. And that scares me more than anything that they have done to us before.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Wait.  Wait! What are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: I'm getting you out of here.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Don't.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: I'm not leaving you, Sawyer. I can get it open.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: No. You're already out. You've got to go. You've got to leave me!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Run!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: What did they do to you?!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Will you go!!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: What is that thing?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Run. Just go. It's every man for himself.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Why didn't you fight back?! Tell me the truth for once in your life!
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: If you really love me -- go.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: I only said that so he'd stop hitting you. 
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Run. Hurry!  What the hell are you doing? Kate?! Damn it, Freckles, go. Every man for himself.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 KATE: Live together, die alone.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 TOM: You know Danny wants to kill him.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Danny can wait.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 TOM: Should I bring Shephard back?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: No, I want him to sit with her for a while longer.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: I'm, I'm sorry they -- they, uh, had to put handcuffs on you. Um, I'm a fertility doctor. I'm not used to death.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: What was her name?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Cole; it was short for Colleen. I shouldn't have, uh -- I should have come to get you sooner.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: It wouldn't have mattered. There wasn't any more that you could have done. She was -- she was dead before you put her on the table.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: Are you just saying that to make me feel better?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: I don't care about making you feel better.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JULIET: I'm going to take you back now. Um, I'm sorry for bringing you here.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 JACK: Who's x-rays are those? Outside? Those are spinal x-rays. They belong to a man about 40 years old. And whoever he is, he has a very large tumor on his L-4 vertebrae. And I just happen to be a spinal surgeon. So, you tell me, Juliet, who am I here to save?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 HURLEY: Is that -- art?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 DESMOND: Nope. Just an experiment.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 HURLEY: Okay. You want some fruit salad?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 DESMOND: Thanks, I'm not hungry.  You might want to wait a minute.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 HURLEY: Why's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Good morning. Let's go for a walk.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 WARDEN HARRIS: I have to be honest, Ford. When they first brought you here, I thought you were nothing more than a dumb hick. Now I know better. You're a dumb hick that knows how to steal.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Can we just get this over with?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 WARDEN HARRIS: Yeah, let's. You remember Agent Freedman from the Treasury Department?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 AGENT FREEDMAN: So, what have you got?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: 10 million's in a red Bronco parked in a Stor-Quik facility in Sawgrass, right off 441, unit 23C. That's where your money is.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 WARDEN HARRIS: As agreed, the last 6 years of your sentence have been commuted.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 AGENT FREEDMAN: As soon as the truck is recovered and the funds confirmed, your commission will be processed. Now, how would you like that?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Set up a new account. It don't matter what bank, just make it in Albuquerque.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 AGENT FREEDMAN: Okay.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Put it in the name of Clementine Phillips.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 AGENT FREEDMAN: Okay, Clementine Phillips.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: And I want it so there's no way she can ever find out who the money's from.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 WARDEN HARRIS: Who's Clementine Phillips?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: We done?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 WARDEN HARRIS: Congratulations, Ford, you just lied and cheated your way out of prison. You're a free man.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Not much further, James -- just at the top of the next rise.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What's up there?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Something I want you to see.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: That little place you always wanted, George?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What, don't you read? It's from Of Mice and Men. You'd like it -- puppies get killed.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: Bring me up here to kill me? Make that thing you put inside of me blow up my damn heart?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: Your heart's not going to blow up, James. The only thing we put inside you was doubt. Oh, the watch is a heart rate monitor, but nothing more.  Look. We gave him a sedative, not a pacemaker.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: How do I know that's the same bunny? That you didn't just paint an 8 on another one?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: You don't.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: You son-of-a-bitch.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: The rabbit wasn't the thing I wanted to show you.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What the--?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: You ever been to Alcatraz -- take the tour? Right now you're standing on a small island roughly twice the size of Alcatraz. And that over there -- that's your island -- the one you've come to know and love. I just wanted you to know there's nowhere to run.
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: You did all this just to -- just to keep me in a damn cage?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: We did all this because the only way to gain a con man's respect is to con him. And you're pretty good, Sawyer. We're a lot better. Funny thing is, us telling you about the pacemaker wasn't what kept you in line. It was when I threatened her. You work so hard to make her think you don't care -- that you don't need her, but, "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody. It don't make no difference who the guy is, long as he's with you. I tell you, I tell you a guy gets too lonely and he gets sick."
Lost.Season03.Episode04 SAWYER: What the hell are you talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode04 BEN: It's from Of Mice and Men. Don't you read? Come on, let's get you back to your cage.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Here, eat. It's okay, Yemi.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 NUN: Eko?!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 NUN: Alright Eko. Go.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 NUN: Did you hear me? Go! Confess that you have stolen.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Yemi was hungry.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 NUN: That is not an excuse. You have sinned, Eko! Hunger does not matter. Now go. Ask God for forgiveness.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 NUN: Confess!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID: How long has he been like this?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 HURLEY: Couple of days now.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID: Eko. Can you hear me? What happened to him?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: Before or after we saved him from the polar bear cave?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 HURLEY: Come on. Locke will want to know you guys are back.  Stay alive dude, ok?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 YEMI: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: I have come to give my confession.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 YEMI: Hello, Eko.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO:  Hello, brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: I have some merchandise that I need to get out of the country.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 YEMI: You mean drugs.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: You will make us priests and we will fly the drugs out ourselves.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 YEMI: My signature does not make you a priest, Eko. You could never be a priest.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 YEMI: No! Stop! No more! No more!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Yemi! Yemi! No! No! No! Help me get to the plane.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SOLDIER: Father? Are you okay, Father?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 YEMI: Eko! Eko, wake up!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 YEMI: It is time to confess. To be judged, Brother. I will be waiting. You know where to find me.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 HURLEY: You guys smell smoke?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID: Get him clear!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: Eko! Help!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: Pick him up!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 HURLEY: Eko. Eko, come on!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: Pick him up!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 HURLEY: We gotta get you outta here!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: Cover him up. Cover him with this!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 HURLEY: Come on, Eko.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: Careful...careful!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 HURLEY: It's hot, Eko! Careful!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: Lay him down... lay him down.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: You're ok. You're alright.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO:  My... brother. My... brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: You're alright. It's ok.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: My... brother. Yemi.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: It's alright. I'll be back.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Yemi...
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Charlie! Is everyone ok?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: Yeah! We're good.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Where's Eko?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: Hurley and I pulled him out... over...
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: He was right there! Eko? Eko?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: Good evening, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Good evening, Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: I was hoping you might join me for a walk.  What?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Well, you say that like...you're not going to just throw a bag over my head and drag me out of here if I say no.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: Then don't say no. Why don't you put this on.  I'll wait outside.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Does it hurt?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: Sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Your neck, does it hurt? Any numbness in your fingers and toes, like pins and needles when your foot falls asleep, but permanent?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: Why are you asking me these questions, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Because, Ben, you have a tumor on your spine. An aggressive tumor... that... is going to kill you. I don't know when those x-rays were taken that I saw, but unless they were very recent... you're not going to be taking walks much longer.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: I have no idea what you're talking about.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Ok. My mistake then.  I'm ready whenever you are.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: Stay here.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN:  As we prepare to send Colleen on her way, I'd like to take a moment...
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: I hate funerals.  He let you out?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Gave me a new shirt, too.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: Bye, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN:  Why did you show him my x-rays?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: I didn't tell him they were yours. But I guess you did.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: I think I know how to find Jack, Kate and Sawyer.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID: Can I ask why he's being included in the conversation?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 DESMOND: Is that supposed to hurt my feelings?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Tell him what you told me.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 DESMOND: The computer in the hatch wasn't only for pushing the button. I'm pretty sure... it could be used to communicate with other stations.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID: This is fascinating. But you just told me the hatch exploded.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: One of them did.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID: You want to try and communicate with the others.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Yup.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 HURLEY: No luck, dudes. We looked everywhere. Eko's gone.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: There's no trail.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 HURLEY: Not that we, like, know what a trail looks like.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: When you pulled him out of the tent, did he say anything?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: Nothing coherent. Just mumbling 'My brother, my brother.'
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Sayid, pack your gear. We're going to that computer.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 CHARLIE: Wait! What about Eko?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: We'll catch up to him. We're all going to the same place.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SOLDIER: You're home, father.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA: Father?  Oh! I was looking for Father Yemi.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Father Yemi is...is gone. He was called away quite suddenly. An emergency at the refugee camp... down South.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA: I am Amina. I work at the clinic. This is my son Daniel. He is the altar boy here. Are you taking his place?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA: Will Father Yemi still go to London?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: London?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA: He was leaving at the end of the week. He was going to continue his studies.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: I will take his place there, too.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 MAN: No! Don't! Please! No!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 DANIEL:  Shhhhhh. Confess.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Hey everybody. We're heading out to the Pearl station. There's a computer there that might help us find our people. Anybody want to come along?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 HURLEY: What do you mean 'Anybody want to come along?'
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: I mean, if you'd like to join us, it's a free island.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 HURLEY: Yeah, see, Jack would go and do stuff alone. Or he'd take Sayid or Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Yeah, well. I'm not Jack. The more the merrier.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 NIKKI: I'll go.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Great!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 PAULO: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Anybody else want to come, meet us at the tree line in 10 minutes. Bring water.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 PAULO:  You're not serious.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 NIKKI: What? You always whine about not being included. Now's our chance.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 DESMOND: Would you mind if I asked you a question, Brother?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Shoot.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 DESMOND: Are we off to poke at a computer, or are we going after your man Eko?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Two birds, one stone. Eko's heading for the plane that crashed on top of the entrance to the Pearl station.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 DESMOND: Well, that's quite a coincidence.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Don't mistake coincidence for fate.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 DANIEL: You're not supposed to do that. That's holy water.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: I'm washing away my sins.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 DANIEL: Father Yemi wouldn't...
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: I am not Father Yemi.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Wait there!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EMEKA: ... where is Father Yemi?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Who wants to know?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EMEKA: Perhaps you did not hear me. I said, where is Father Yemi?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA: The shipment is late! I just got off the telephone. He assured me it would arrive on Friday.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: What shipment?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EMEKA: You should explain our arrangement to the new priest.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA: We receive shipments of vaccines from the Red Cross. We are allowed to keep 20 percent. The rest we give to Emeka and his men.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EMEKA: In exchange for protection. So you see Father, everybody is happy! Huh? Hmmm? Everybody's happy. Everybody benefits! So, I hope you will continue to honor our arrangement.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: I am not afraid of you.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EMEKA: I'll be back for the vaccine on Friday, Father. You don't want more lives on your conscience.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Hello, Eko!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: You want to guess what's for lunch?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: I'm not... I'm not big on mysteries.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: Of course you're not.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK:  You people have cheeseburgers?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: You have no idea what I went through to make this for you. I killed the cow, processed the meat, baked the bun. And the fries... try rendering animal fat.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: No ketchup?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: I'd like to talk to him.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: Ok. So talk to him.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: Alone. Please.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: I'm fine with her being here.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: And I'm thrilled that you're fine, Jack, but it's private. Doctor-patient confidentiality.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: Sure. Of course.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Mind if I eat?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: We had such a wonderful plan to break you, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Break me?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: Wear you down till you were convinced we weren't your enemies. Get you to trust us. And then of course we'd lead you to believe that you were choosing to do... whatever we asked you to do. All of this of course assumed that you would get... invested.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Invested in what?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: Has it not occurred to you that Juliet bears a striking resemblance to your ex-wife?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Why are you telling me this?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: I'm telling you this, Jack, because my wonderful plan... got shot to sunshine when you saw my damned x-rays and figured out I was dying.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: All of this... you brought me here to operate on you. You... you want me to save your life?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: No, I want you to want to save my life. But we're beyond that now, so... all I can ask is that you think about it.  Do you believe in God, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Do you?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 BEN: Two days after I found out I had a fatal tumor on my spine, a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky. And if that's not proof of God, I don't know what is.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Hey! Are you sure you are all right? We can stop for a bit and catch our breath.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: I'm fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: You're heading for the plane wreckage aren't you? Charlie heard you call out for your brother before you left the camp. Is that what you're doing out here, looking for Yemi?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Do not speak my brother's name again!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: What are you so afraid of, Eko?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA:  You need to come back in two days.  Father! What can I do for you?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Yes, is that... the vaccine that you spoke of? How often do the shipments come?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA: Every six months, if we are lucky. What makes you so interested in our shipments of vaccine, Father?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: You agreed to give most of it to the militia?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA: The vaccines fetch a high price in the black markets. Whatever you are thinking, do not cross these men. Before father Yemi, we got nothing. We owe whatever vaccines we have to his work. You remind me of him, you know. You're a good man, too.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 WARLORD: I hear you have some vaccine to sell.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: I do. But it has to be done by Sunday. I'm leaving the country.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 WARLORD: No problem.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE:  The hatch is over here by the plane. Why don't you take everybody down.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID: And you?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: I'll be there in a minute.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 PAULO:  What's Eko looking for?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 NIKKI: His brother's body is in that plane.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: So, what exactly did you see back there? I saw it once, you know.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: And what did you see?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: I saw a very bright light. It was beautiful.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: That is not what I saw.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: My brother's gone!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: You set the plane on fire. Yemi's body could have burned... or, not to mention animals... or...
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: So, you don't want to come down there with us?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: No. I will wait here.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Well...oh, I forgot, I found this when I was looking for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EMEKA: Hello, Father. I hear you have a shipment of vaccine for sale.  If you thought you could do this without me knowing... you don't know who I am.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EMEKA: You know, you're lucky Father, I'm a superstitious man. I don't relish taking the life of a holy man. That is why today, I'm only going to cut off your hands.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EMEKA: No! Don't! Please! No! No!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: You do not know who I am!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 Narration: I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund, and this is the Orientation Film for Station 5 of the DHARMA Initiative. Station 5, or, The Pearl, is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in DHARMA Initiative projects can be observed and recorded.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE:  Well?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID: The wiring is only one-way. It's a closed system. A dead end.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 NIKKI: Hey, guys? What are these other TVs for?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 NIKKI: All these TVs... this guy says that there's 6 stations. Uh, here, check it out.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 Narration: ...is a monitoring station where the activities of participants in DHARMA Initiative projects can be observed and recorded.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 NIKKI: Projects. More than one. So, maybe some of these TVs are connected to the other hatches.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Well, I'm suddenly feeling very stupid.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID: Perhaps I could patch in one of the other feeds. See if we can get another picture.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 PAULO: Ahhhh. The uh, toilet still works.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID: Anything yet?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE:  Nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID:  What about now?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID: John?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Yeah, we got something.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 NIKKI:  Wow! What is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: That's a good question.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 PAULO: Hmmm. Those are computers! Great! That's what you're looking for. Now we can get out of here.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: I guess he'll be expecting us.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: You don't trust me anymore?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: I trust you just fine. Just thought I'd put a movie in.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK:  You know what, I'm going to pass on the movie.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: You'll like this one Jack. It's "To Kill A Mockingbird". It's a classic.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Juliet, I don't want to watch a movie right now!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: I'll turn the sound down then.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: I felt like I should apologize. Say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for bringing you here. And for everything that's been done to you. And your friends. You have to know we were desperate. It was only so that we could save his life.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: Ben. He's a great man.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: I know you find that hard to believe but... he is.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: You probably feel like you don't have a choice. But you do, Jack. Free will is all we've really got, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: Anyway, just wanted to put in my two cents.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: I told you before, you can trust me. I want you to trust me, now, when I tell you that doing the surgery is absolutely the right thing for you to do.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: It's the right thing because he deserves to live.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Turn the movie off.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: Jack...
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JACK: Turn it off! Now.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: Alright. It's off.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 JULIET: Think about what I said. Please.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 DANIEL: Where are you going?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: London.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 DANIEL: Are you a bad man?  My mom says you're a bad man.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Only God knows.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: I see you have your vaccine.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA: Do you expect me to be grateful? I know what you are planning to do.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Those men! I helped--
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA: Those men will be replaced by other men.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: What are they doing? What is the meaning of this?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA: They are boarding up the church. We can no longer use it.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: This is Yemi's church. You have no right to do this!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 AMINA: It is no longer sacred! And one day you'll be judged for what you did! If I were you, I would start making my peace now. I would go to London and begin to repent. Because you owe God for every life you've taken. And you truly believe this is Yemi's? You owe him one church.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Yemi!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Wait! Yemi!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Yemi! You say you want to hear my confession! Why? Why now, eh? Show yourself! Where are you! Where!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 YEMI: Are you ready, Eko?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Yes. I am ready, Yemi.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: I ask for no forgiveness, Father. For I have not sinned. I have only done what I needed to do to survive.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: A small boy once asked me if I was a bad man. If I could answer him now, I would tell him that... when I was a young boy, I killed a man to save my brother's life. I am not sorry for this. I am proud of this.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: I did not ask for the life that I was given. But it was given, nonetheless. And with it... I did my best.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 YEMI:  You speak to me as if I were your brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Who are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO:  Who are you!? Who are you!?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Who are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. The Lord is my shepherd...
Lost.Season03.Episode05 EKO: Oh!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: Eko!
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE:  Ohh...Eko. It's ok. It's ok.
Lost.Season03.Episode05 SAYID: What did he say, John?
Lost.Season03.Episode05 LOCKE: He said, 'We're next.'
Lost.Season03.Episode06 MAN: Police, open the door.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE:  Um. Everything's alright in here.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 MAN: Ma'am, we have reason to believe that someone extremely dangerous is in the motel.  We're conducting a room-to-room search.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE:  I'm alone, officer.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 MAN: The person could be holding you at gunpoint, forcing you to say that. Please open the door.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I don't think I should.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 MAN: Then you have three seconds before I break this door down. One... two...
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Hey. Wanna get it on?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE:  Hell yeah! 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: Hey yourself.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: Throwin' rocks.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Thought you had to pull the lever.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: I know how to get a damn fish biscuit.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Get me one.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: Psh. What, you trying to keep me feeling productive?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: You took these blood tests, made all the notations?  How old are the x-rays?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: A week.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK:  The tumor on your spine is borderline inoperable. And at the rate it's growing, that borderline goes away in about one week.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN:  Oh.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: The OR we were in, is that fully equipped?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Anesthesia? Sterile?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: You needed to be in surgery yesterday.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: Alright, then. Whatever you need, it's yours. I'm ready.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK:  No, I think you misunderstood me. I didn't say I was gonna do it. I just wanted you to understand how you're gonna die.  You think I believe you people? You think I trust you? That I'm just going to do the surgery, and HOPE that you let me go?!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: Jack!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK:  No, don't!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: Well, Jack. I'm very disappointed in your decision.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Well, Ben. At least you won't have to be disappointed for very long.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: You shouldn't have come here.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Yeah, you're right. I've made a huge mistake, and I'm just full of regret right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE:  Seriously. It's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: It's bad luck to see the bride in her dress before the wedding. You, my friend, are naked.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Have you tried it on?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I had to hold my breath to get the claspy things to clasp. So, I'm waiting for the very last minute.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Well, it's about twelve hours, right? Might wanna get clasping.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Hey. I know its... it's been fast. But this is right. I know it's real. And I love you, Monica.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I love you too, Kevin.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Time for work. 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: What about him? 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: He's got the day off.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Well, if he's not working, neither am I.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Oh, you're not, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: Go, Freckles. Man wants to give me a day off? Let him give me a day off.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: No Sawyer, we're a team. You break the rocks, I haul 'em.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT:  Alright. Fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT:  Lord knows I wouldn't want to break up the team.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 NIKKI: What happened to him?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 LOCKE: Must have been an animal. Maybe one of the bears.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 NIKKI: Are we gonna carry him back?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 LOCKE: No. We're gonna bury him here.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 DESMOND: Are we?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 LOCKE: The people back in camp... there's just been a few too many funerals lately. Nobody needs to see him like this. I'll slip back to the beach and get a couple of shovels.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAYID: I'll come with you.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 LOCKE: No I'll be back in an hour.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAYID:  It's not safe to go alone, John!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 LOCKE: I appreciate your concern.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAYID: So, what killed Eko?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 LOCKE:  Folks back at the beach call it "the Monster". I don't really have a name for it. You don't believe in monsters?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAYID: I believe in what I can see. But obviously you have. So, why don't you tell me what you think it is?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 LOCKE: Might be what brought us here.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAYID: So, you think that this Monster decided that Eko was meant to die?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 LOCKE: I believe that Eko died for a reason. I just don't know what it is yet.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAYID: That's why you lied? We're not headed back to the camp, are we, John?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 LOCKE: Sure we are. Just need to take a little detour first. 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT:  Where is she?! Someone's on the grid. I want him on the ground , her, too .  If he moves, you shoot him!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT:  Yeah, they're here. The doctor get out again?  You sure? Well, does he know? How the hell did she get over here?!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 ALEX:  Come on! Get up! Go!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Alex! Alex!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: What the hell do you think you're doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 ALEX: What, you gonna shoot me?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: You know you're not supposed to be here. So let's just calm down...
Lost.Season03.Episode06 ALEX: What did you do to him, Danny?! Where is he?! I wanna talk to Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Sure, that sounds like a great idea. So why don't we just lower our little sling-
Lost.Season03.Episode06 ALEX:  WHERE IS HE?! Tell me!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 ALEX: Get off of me!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Get her out of here. Get her OUT of here!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 ALEX: Let me go!  Listen, whatever they say, don't believe them! They're gonna kill your boyfriend just like they killed mine!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: I don't understand. It's supposed to be two weeks.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: Our schedule's been moved up.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: That's an order?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: It's coming from him.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: It's stupid.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: It's not my call. It's the way it is, Danny.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Alright.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET:  I would like you to put this on, and come with me. Please. 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: You think I'm going to put a hood over my head because you said please?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: No Kate. I think you're going to put a hood over your head because the man standing behind me, the one who's burning a hole in my back?  That man is going to kill Sawyer. But if you put this on, and you come with me, there's something you can do for us that will save his life.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Come in?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SUZANNE: Oh, sweetheart. You're beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE:  How is it out there?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SUZANNE: There are a lot of excited policemen.  Don't worry, I've asked them not to shoot their guns in there when you say "I do."
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: You know, mother-in-laws aren't supposed to be so nice.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SUZANNE: Monica, I have something for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Suzanne, you shouldn't have.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SUZANNE: My mother gave that to me on my wedding day. She told me one day I'd give it to my daughter. But, since I have four boys... here.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: It's perfect. 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PRIEST: You know, Kevin's been coming to the church here since he's been about yea high. When I first met you Monica, I was struck by your honesty and devotion to Kevin.  When I asked him what he loved most about you, he said "What you see, is what you get." That being said, you've got the rings, vowed your vows, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET:  Step.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: I'll give you two some privacy. 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK:  Hey. You Ok?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Yeah. You?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Yeah, I'm great.  Where are they keeping you?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Outside. In a cage.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Sawyer?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: He's in a cage, too. They're making us work.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Work? On what?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I dunno what it is, but it's big. We're hauling rocks, and...
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Hey. Did they hurt you?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Kate, hey. Hey. It's gonna be alright.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Jack. You have to do it. This thing that they told you, this operation.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: She said that if you do it that...
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: What did they do to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Jack...
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: What did they do to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Nothing!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: How did they get you to ask me?! What did they offer you?!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE:  Jack, please! Nothing!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Then what are you doing here?!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: They're gonna kill Sawyer!  I'm sorry!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I'm so sorry! But she said that if you do it, and you do it soon, they'll let us go!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: And you believe them?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I have to.  Jack? Please...
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: We're done here.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Jack!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK:  Hey! We're done in here!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE:  Jack! I'm sorry! 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: Get her out of there.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE:  Jack! Jack! Please!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Hey, you.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN:  Hey! What's for dinner, gorgeous?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: It's taco night.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: You're making tacos?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE:  Yes, and you'd better like em.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Or what?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Or no dessert. I'm leaving now, I'll be home soon.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Love you.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I love you, too.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 MARSHAL: Agent Mars.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: It's me.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 MARSHAL: Well, I'm glad. I realized this morning that it was the Feast of the Assumption and I was feeling bad. How many holy days have come and gone since you last called? I thought you and I were friends?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I don't want to run anymore.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 MARSHAL: What's his name?  Does he know who you are?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Edward, please. I know you don't want to spend the rest of your life chasing me. Please, I love this guy. Just let me go.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 MARSHAL: I'll tell you what.  If you can really stay put? Really settle down? Then I'll stop chasing you.  But you and I both know that's not gonna happen.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: Sawyer. You really care about him, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Where is he?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: I'm sorry you weren't able to help us, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: Danny...
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: Danny! 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Right. Sorry, Jules.  You got anything you wanna say to your girl? You best say it tonight.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: And how was your day, honey?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 LOCKE: When the hatch exploded, your prayer stick fell out of a tree right on top of me. So, Sayid and I came out to get it, because it didn't seem right to bury you without it. I'd like to think you died for a reason, Mr. Eko. I just hope that it's not too long before we find out what the heck it might be.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 LOCKE: Rest in peace, Mr. Eko. Thank you for helping me find my...
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I saw Jack. They brought me in to see him. They want him to do surgery on Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: Who the hell is Ben?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Henry. The guy who brought us in. He's sick. And they say that if he does it, they're gonna let us all go.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: And you and me are what, bait?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Something like that.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: At least the doc ain't dumb enough to do it.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I told him he had to.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: Why the hell would you do something so stupid?!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: To save your life!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: My life don't need saving!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: You want to die?! Because that's what's going to happen! Pickett is just waiting for his chance! I've seen him look at you!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: Dammit, Freckles, stay put.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: And you know what he's going to do! So don't pretend like you don't care!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: Get down, Freckles, we've already been through this.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Shut up, James.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: You don't want Jack to save your life? Then you're gonna save your own. We're getting out of here now. 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: Stop it, dammit, Kate!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Go! Get out of here, run!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: You're out of your cage. Why don't you run, Kate?! Because me? I ain't running, 'cause there ain't no place to go.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER:  We ain't on our island. We're on another island, like Alcatraz, couple miles off shore. So unless you're a mermaid, or you got a boat, there ain't no point.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE:  When were you planning on telling me this?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER:  Never.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Why not?! Why wouldn't you?!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: 'Cause I wanted you to believe we had a damn chance.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: What was that for?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I don't know.  I don't know.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Very nice.  OK, now it's your turn. Look under your placemat.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: What did you do?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Just look.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: What is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: You know that honeymoon I've been promising you for 6 months? You are holding in your hand two tickets to Costa Rica. You got your passport ready, baby?  Hey. What's wrong?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Nothing. I just love you so much.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: C'mere. 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: Lemme ask you something, Freckles. When Blockhead was beating on me, and you said "I love you." That was just... to get him to stop, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: I love you, too.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Who is this? Hello? Hello!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 FEMALE VOICE: Try... the door.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: If it helps, I was surprised, too.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: If I were a betting man, I would have picked her and you.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Shut up.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: Well. I suppose this would be the proverbial nail in my coffin, wouldn't it.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK:  Tomorrow.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: Sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Tomorrow morning. First thing. And everything I mentioned before. The instruments. The anesthesia. And someone who can hold a damn clamp.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: Yes. Of course.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: I'll get it out, your tumor. And I'll keep you alive. But I need your word. I need what you promised me before. I need to get the hell off this island.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: Done.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Whatcha workin' on?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Just finishing some IRs, and that fugitive recovery in Tampa. Being a cop is just endless paperwork.  Thank you, sweetie.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: What if I told you I was a fugitive?  What if I told you I was on the run for blowing up my father, and it was only a matter of time before you found out?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: This isn't funny.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE:  It's not a joke. I almost had a baby, Kevin. Me, a baby! I can't do this! Taco night?! I don't do taco night!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Ok, calm down, Monica...
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: My name's not Monica!  I love you. But I can't stay. 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Whoah, hey...
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Kev...
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Something's wrong with me.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I drugged you.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: You what?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I had to. Otherwise they will think you knew. People are going to be asking a lot of questions and I didn't want you to lose your job.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KEVIN: Wait... 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: No, Ke--
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: This is going to be a very tricky procedure. If I tell you to do something, I need you to do it then and there, no questions asked.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: You may find this very hard to believe, but I've always been very good at just following orders.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Is that a yes?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Good. Let's go.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: Do you get nervous? Before you do surgery?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: I used to. Not anymore, no.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: Whatever happens, everything will be very different, won't it?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: No doubt about it.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: Juliet. Did Alex ask about me?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: No. We took her home last night. I don't know where she is now.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: Well, see you on the other side.  I'm ready.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: I need you to count down from twenty.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 BEN: 20, 19... 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Scalpel.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Let's go. 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JASON: Ben's just gone into surgery.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Ben just put his life in the hands of one of them! Shephard wasn't even on Jacob's list.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Sawyer.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Well, well, well. Look who got out of her cage. You shoulda run when you had the chance. Let's go, James.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Don't, please! You don't have to do this. 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: He's coming with me, and there's nothing you can do about it! Step away!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Hand me another hemostat.  Swab again. 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: What happened? Is he Ok?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 IVAN: His blood pressure's dropping. Should he be bleeding like that?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Nope, no, he shouldn't.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK:  Back away from the table.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JULIET: Jack...
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Back away from the table! Now!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Can you hear me in there?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 TOM: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Good. I just made a small incision in Ben's kidney sac. Now, if I don't stitch that back up in the next hour, he's dead. Now get in here, and bring that walkie-talkie!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Step away!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: You let go, or I do her too!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Let go!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Don't you let go! Don't you think about it, Sawyer, you fight! No! Sawyer, NO!!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: No, NO!! Sawyer, PLEASE! You get your hands off of him!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Get on your knees! 
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Please!! I'll do anything you want!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: I want you to watch!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: Close your eyes, Freckles.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Stand up!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 SAWYER: Close your eyes!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: NO! NO! NO!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: This is for Colleen. You son-of-a-bitch!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 TOM:  Danny, you there? Pick it up. Pick it up, Danny. Pick it up, dammit!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: I'm here, WHAT?!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 TOM: Are you anywhere near the cages?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Yeah, you could say that.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 TOM: Give your walkie to Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: Now why the hell would I do that?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 TOM:  Because if you don't, the doctor's gonna let Ben die!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT: What are you talkin' about? What's that beeping?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 TOM: Just hand her the damn walkie, Danny!  Do it. Just do it now!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 PICKETT:  Let go of her.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Jack? Jack!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Kate? You have about an hour headstart before they come after you.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Where are you? Where are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: You remember what I told you on the beach? The day of the crash. You remember what story I told you when you were stitching me up?  DO YOU REMEMBER IT?!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE:  YES! Yes, I remember!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: When you get safe, you radio me, and you tell that story.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Jack, please.
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: If I don't get a call from you in the next hour, I'm going to know something went wrong, and  HE DIES!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I can't leave without you!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Yes, you are. Go!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: Jack! I can't!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Go, now!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 KATE: I can't!
Lost.Season03.Episode06 JACK: Kate, dammit, RUN!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ETHAN: Hello.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 RACHEL:  Oh, I fell asleep.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: With candles burning -- it's real safe.  We don't have to keep doing this, you know.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 RACHEL: Are you saying that because you don't think it's going to work? Or, because you're afraid he'll find out?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Lift up your shirt.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  Okay.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 RACHEL: Some doctor you are.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: I'm not doing this as your doctor. I'm doing it as your sister.  I don't like you being here alone. Come stay with me.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 RACHEL: I like living on the beach.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: This is Miami, Rachel -- everything's on the beach.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK:  You have about an hour's head start before they come after you. Take a walkie, take Sawyer. Go.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Wait, where are you? Where are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Kate, listen to me, just listen to me. Do you remember what I told you on the beach? Do you remember what story I told you when you were stitching me up? Do you remember it?!!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Yes, yes, I remember!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: When you get safe, you radio me and you tell me that story.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Jack, please.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: If I don't get a call from you in the next hour I'm going to know something went wrong and he dies!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: I can't leave without you!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Yes you are. Go.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Jack, I can't!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Go! Now!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: No, I can't!!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK:  Kate, damn it, run!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: Juliet, stop the bleeding and stitch him up.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: She's not a surgeon; she can't fix this.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: He's right.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Sawyer, let's go! Sawyer!!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM:  Then what the hell do you suggest we do?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  Go get Danny, then find Austen and Ford and bring them back.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK:  No, you do that and Ben dies.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Go.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: You think I'm lying?! You think this is a bluff?! I will let him die!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: No, Jack, you won't.  Go, get them back. If you have to, kill them.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  Hello.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 DIANA: Dr. Burke?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 DIANA: This is Diana from Mittelos Bioscience. I'm calling to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Two o'clock, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 DIANA: Two o'clock. Dr. Alpert asked me to tell you that he's very much looking forward to meeting you.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Me too. Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 DIANA: Goodbye.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: These are the main labs... (unintelligible) ...this little baby here took most of last year's grant. You don't really want to talk about that now do you? 
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: Hello, Juliet.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Hey. Hey, Ed.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: Why exactly are you here?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Uh, I, um -- today's lab work -- I got home and I realized I inverted some numbers.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: And it couldn't wait until the morning?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 WOMAN: Uh, Edmund?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: Oh, I'm sorry. How rude of me. Juliet, this is Sherry. Sherry, this is Juliet, my ex-wife. Juliet's leaving.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: I am. 
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: Jules? Could you please turn off the lights?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: You haven't thought this through, Jack. Your plan's not going to work.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Yeah? Why's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Your friends aren't going to make it back to your side of the island because we're not on that island. We're on a smaller island two miles offshore.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: Afraid so.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: So why don't we see if we can come up with some kind of peaceful resolution?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: A peaceful resolution?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: That's right.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Is that what you call asking me to kill Ben while on the operating table? Make it look like an accident?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  That's ridiculous.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: She wants Ben to die. She said if I did it that she would protect me!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Tom! He's lying! I don't know what you're trying to do, Jack, but...
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: ENOUGH! Juliet, get out.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Tom, he's lying!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: You said you can't stitch him up -- then you don't need to be in here. Go Julie.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Don't let him fool you. He'll never let a patient just die.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT: Hey! Hey, can anybody hear me?!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 IVAN: What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT: Open the cage.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 IVAN: Where's--?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT: Just open the damn cage!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE:  That's our island?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: What, you didn't believe me when I told you before?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: We need a boat.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Yeah, a couple of towels and buffet lunch.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: We'll just keep following the beach. There's got to be one around here somewhere. How else would they get back and forth?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Why don't you stop and ask for directions?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE:  Jack, are you there?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Are you okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: I'm fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Tell him I said hi -- get to the point!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Jack, we need a boat. We need some way to get off this island.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK:  You heard her. How do they get off this island?!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: What's he doing?!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Kate? Kate?!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Kate?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: This way.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT:  Jason, you alright?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT:  Over there! Over there!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Come on, get inside. Get inside, go.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT: Come on. Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet. Shh, shh. What? Where'd they go?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 IVAN: That way.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Nice to meet you, Sheena.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: Is it true?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Is what true?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: What you said -- did Juliet really ask you to kill him?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Yeah, and in about 40 minutes she's going to get her wish.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 BEN:  Hey, that's not helping anything. Now, could somebody please get Juliet?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SHERRY: Juliet, Edmund wants to see you in his office.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  Do you work here?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SHERRY: I'm the new research assistant.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Of course you are.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: I want in.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: In on what?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: I know what you're doing, Juliet.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  I'm not really sure what...
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: I read your notes. I know what you took from the lab. The only thing I don't know is who's your guinea pig.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Ed, I've been doing my research in my own lab, on my own time. I don't really see how--
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: It's your sister, isn't it?  Look, Jules, there's two ways this plays out. One is your research is potentially genius. And the other -- it raises some very serious ethical questions. Maybe even criminal concerns. But if you collaborate with me, based on my reputation, all this is viewed as cutting edge science. And we will win prizes and drink champagne. And do a lot of good for people.  Why don't I give you some time to think about it?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: Juliet, Ben's awake.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: How?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: Shephard says he's a spinal surgeon, not an anesthesiologist. Ben's asking for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: This a hobby of yours, Underdog -- digging holes?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Yep. That and basket weaving. Want one?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Happen to have a tunnel to the mainland?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: No, but I've got a boat.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Can we use it?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Yeah, but we've got to hurry.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Hold on a second, sister. You just happen to find us in the woods? You just happen to have a boat, and you're going to let us use it, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: There's something we need to do first.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Oh, gee.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: My boyfriend is being held prisoner. If you help me rescue him, I promise you I'll get you back to the other island.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Your boyfriend -- his name happen to be Karl?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX:  Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Aw, sheee, come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: I stopped the surgery.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 BEN: I know. I've been able to hear you for a few minutes now. It's very clever of you. I should have seen it coming.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Are you in pain? I can...
Lost.Season03.Episode07 BEN: No, but thanks all the same.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 BEN: I'd like to speak to Juliet alone, please, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: No. No, I'm sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 BEN: Please, I'm asking you one gentleman to another. It won't hurt you to give me three minutes, will it? Knowing I have only 27 left?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK:  If you touch him, if you try...
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: I won't.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: You've got three minutes.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: I'm Tom, by the way.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: They've got history.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: I would like you to go back in there, put Ben under, and finish the surgery.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: And why would I want to do that?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Because I'm going to go help your friends escape.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: Thank you for taking the time to let us make our pitch, Dr. Burke. Mittelos Bioscience is based in Oregon. We're just outside of Portland.  Uh, these shots might seem a little cheese-ball, but our people really are this happy. Now why? Because we're privately funded. Privately funded means freedom.  We organize trips every week in and around the Portland area which is just awesome for hiking and biking and river running.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Look, when you -- your company -- reached out to me I was flattered. But I don't really know why you would want me.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: Is it true that you successfully impregnated a male field mouse?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  He didn't carry to term.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: Mind if I ask you something?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Sure.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT:  What do you see?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Well, that's a human womb, obviously. Judging from the decomposition of the endometrium I would say that the woman was somewhere in her seventies.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: Well, actually, she's 26.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: What happened to her?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: What if I told you that you could have complete freedom and money to find out? We think you're special, Dr. Burke. And we want you to lead a team of highly trained people because we think you're just that good.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: I can't.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: Why can't you?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: My ex-husband wouldn't let me. I...
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: He wouldn't want you to have this opportunity?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  No, he doesn't want me to have anything. He would never give the okay. It's...
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: Maybe we could reach out to him on your behalf?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Don't bother.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: There must be something that he would respond to.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: If he were hit by a bus. How about that? That would work.  How totally inappropriate.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: No, no, no.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: No, I, uh -- I'm sorry, but I've wasted your time.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: Dr. Burke, please -- no, you don't...
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  No, I'm sorry. Whatever you think I am, I'm not. I'm not a leader, Mr. Alpert. I'm a mess.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Oh, hell.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Karl's got to be in there.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: What, you mean you ain't sure?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: It's the only place I haven't looked.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: You know the guard?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Yeah, his name's Aldo.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Aldo? Okay, Lollipop, you want to tell me how we're going to get by him with one gun and no bullets?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: I've got an idea.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Of course you do.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Open the door!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALDO: Alex? What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: They must have gotten out of their cages. I caught them in the jungle. Now open up, Aldo!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALDO: Whoa! Whoa! Just stop! Alex, you're not supposed to be here. If your dad finds out, he's going to kill me.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: My dad was the one who told me to bring them here -- to you. Look, maybe you should call him. I'm sure he's got nothing better to do.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALDO:  Danny, I need Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALDO: Listen, I've got Alex here. She's got Austen and Ford with her.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT: Damn it, whatever she says, don't believe it. Hold them right there. I'm on my way.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Don't get mad at me just because you were dumb enough to fall for the old Wookiee prisoner gag.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Where's Karl?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALDO: I have no idea what you're talking about.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Shoot him in the knee.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE:  Give me the damn rifle. We don't have time for this. I'll do it.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALDO: Whoa! Whoa! Okay, alright! He's at the end of the hall, room 23. Keys are in my back pocket.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Damn good con, Freckles. I almost believed you were going to shoot that boy.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: It wasn't a con.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Here it is!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER:  Give it to me.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE:  Help! Help!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX:  It's okay; we're here to help.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Is he okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Look, we got your boyfriend back. Now, where's your damn boat?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT: Idiot! Where are they?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALDO: I don't know. Alex is with them.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  Danny! We're letting them go.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT: Letting them go?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Ben gave the order.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT: Ben's in surgery. I was just there.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: He woke up.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT: Oh, he woke up, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Shephard won't finish the surgery unless he knows his friends are off the island. Do you want Ben to die?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 PICKETT: I know Ben would rather die than let them go.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 RACHEL: Hey. How was the interview?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: It's not for me.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 RACHEL: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: It's fine. We're too far away, anyway. It's Portland.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 RACHEL: Jule, you didn't say no because of me.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Well, why would I want to go all the way to Portland for research that doesn't even work?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 RACHEL:  Because it does work.  I'm pregnant. I'm pre -- I'm pregnant.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 RACHEL:  Look, look. I took a blood test, too. I didn't want to tell you until I was sure.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: It worked.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 RACHEL: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 RACHEL: My whole life all I ever wanted was to have a baby. And now because of you I can. Oh, God. Now I just need to get healthy. Now I just need to get healthy so I can see the little bugger get into an Ivy League school, you know.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: You will. Of course you will. You will.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 RACHEL: Now you can tell that bastard ex-husband of yours what he can do with his ethics.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: Because you're insufferable. And you're mean. Well, you asked me for the truth, Mom, and that's the truth.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Ed!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: Let me call you later, okay? Okay, bye. Hello, Jules. What's up?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: She's pregnant.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: Excuse me?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: It worked. Rachel's pregnant.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: Ju -- Julia, that's -- wow. I need, uh -- I need to see your labs. We'll have to verify the data if we're going to...
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: No! I'm not interested in publishing, Ed. It's my sister.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 EDMUND: Fine, then, if you're not interested why are you concerned--?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: You okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: Yeah, I just don't like blood too much.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK:  Well, then you probably won't want to be looking at that.  So, if you really can get off the island why didn't you just take him to a facility? Why all this?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: Because ever since the sky turned purple, we've been...
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: What the hell happened?!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: I just nicked an artery.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: Isn't that what you already did?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK:  Yeah, well, that was on purpose.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: Can you fix it?!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Damn it!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: You got him?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: I got him.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Nice ride.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE:  Karl, we've got to go now, okay? Can you stand?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Help me.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE:  Okay, can you stand?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER:  So, you're the boss's daughter, huh? I never saw that coming.  Let's go, Cheech; we're going for a little ride.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Careful.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: Alright, alright, easy. I'm going to put you in the boat, alright?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Wait, wait. You'll be okay.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KARL:  Danny.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: No, Sawyer.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KARL: Danny!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE:  No!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  Danny!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: What happened? Is he...?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: I can't see.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: I can't see. There's too much blood. Alright, get over here.  Tom, he's going to die if you don't get over here right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Go. Get out of here.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER: You heard the lady.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX:  Let's go.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Not you, Alex. You're staying.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: We both know your father. The only way he'll let Karl live is if you're here when he wakes up. I'm sorry, Alex.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KARL: Hey, Alex.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KARL: I missed you.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALEX: I know. I missed you, too. You have to go away now; but I'll see you real soon.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KARL: I love you.  I have to go sleep now.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  Wait.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Easy. Okay, easy.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: Wait. Wait!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Hold it steady, damn it. Hold it steady.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE:  Jack, are you there?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK:  Alright, hold that up to me. The walkie, hold it up to me.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: What about the surgery?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Just do it!!  Yeah, I'm here, Kate. You okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Yeah, I -- we've got a boat. They're letting us go.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Who's letting you go?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: The blond woman.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: So you're safe -- you and Sawyer?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Yes, yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Tell me.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Tell you?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: The first day on the beach -- the day of the crash -- the story that I told you. If you're safe, tell me.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 TOM: You think this is the best time, doctor?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Shut up!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE:  You were doing surgery on a girl and you messed up. You made a mistake. You tore something on her back and all the nerves came loose. And you said you were so afraid. And you said the fear was so real. And you didn't know what to do, so you counted to five. And then you weren't afraid anymore. And then it was just gone. And you fixed her. You saved her.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: I need you to make me a promise, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Promise me that you'll never come back here for me. Don't come back, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Jack, where are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK:  Turn it off. 
Lost.Season03.Episode07 KATE: Jack! Jack, please, where are you? 
Lost.Season03.Episode07 SAWYER:  The trades are coming. We've got to go. Let's go.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 MORGUE EMPLOYEE: We have some paperwork we need you to sign; but take your time. There's no rush.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Thank you. 
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Were you able to remove the tumor?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Yeah. You'll want to do a biopsy -- see if it's malignant. So what now? I just go back to my cell?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Until they figure out what to do with you.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: "They."  What did he say?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: Ben. What did he say that made you want to save his life?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: It doesn't really matter what he said.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: It matters to me. After everything that I have been put through, you owe me an answer. I want to know what he said.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ETHAN:  Tissue?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET:  Thank you. Thanks.  Have we met?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT:  Hello, Dr. Burke.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Mr. Alpert?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: I'm so sorry for your loss.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: I saw what happened on the news and your office said you were down here. I just wanted to express my condolences in person before I went back up to Portland. This is Ethan. He's one of my colleagues.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ETHAN: It's a pleasure to meet you.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: He was hit by a bus.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: I know. They say you were there when it happened. You must have been...
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: No! No. In our interview I said -- I said that I wanted him to get hit by a bus.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: Dr. Burke, I realize that you're a little shook up right now, but this is just a tragic accident. You can't blame yourself. I don't even remember you saying that.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Why are you here, Mr. Alpert?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: Look, I know the timing is horrible. But we came because we're that serious about getting you to come work with us. Just give us six months. If you need to, you can be back before your sister gives birth.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: How did you know that my...?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: Well, we're very thorough in our recruitment process.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: Can my sister come?
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: Won't work. We're pretty remote. She wouldn't have access to the treatment that she needs.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: But, it's Portland. There's plenty of clinics and...
Lost.Season03.Episode07 ALPERT: Well, actually we're not quite in Portland.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JACK: I want to know what he said.
Lost.Season03.Episode07 JULIET: I've been on this island for 3 years, Jack. 3 years, 2 months, and 28 days. He said that if I let him live and I helped you -- that he would finally let me go home.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 HURLEY: Dude, I don't know about this.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: See, you're looking at this all wrong. He would want us to do this.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 HURLEY: He would want us to ransack his tent and take his stash? Yeah, that sounds exactly like Sawyer.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Well, he stole all this in the first place. I mean, people need food. They need medical supplies. They need --  shocking amounts of pornography.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 HURLEY:  Oh, Desmundo.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I need you to come with me.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 HURLEY: You guys find Eko?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Both of you.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 LOCKE: Eko is dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 SAYID: We found his body in the jungle -- buried him yesterday.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: How did he die?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 LOCKE: The island killed him.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: What do you mean "the island killed him?"  What do you mean "the island killed him?"
Lost.Season03.Episode08 LOCKE: You know what it means. With the doctor gone, the camp's on edge enough without people having to worry about what's out here in the jungle. They're going to look to you two to see how to react.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 LOCKE: So when I tell everyone what happened I need you to help keep things calm.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 HURLEY:  Dude, you okay? Hey guys, what's wrong with Desmond?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 SAYID: What is he doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 LOCKE: There's someone else out there.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Where's Claire?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 SUN: She just went for a walk. I offered to watch the baby.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Claire!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  I've got her.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Is she okay? Claire! What happened?!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  Just stand back; give me some room!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Claire.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Get back, Charlie; I know what I'm doing.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Is she breathing? She's not breathing.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: You want me to help you?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Come on; come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Claire? Claire.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Claire!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Are you alright? Come on; you're okay. Let's get you back to the tent.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Charlie's here!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  It's alright, Charlie.  Alright, let's get her back to her tent.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Is she okay? Let me help.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I got it, Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Hey, I'll take her.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE:  Where are you going? Hey, how did you know? How did you know she was drowning?!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 HURLEY: I'll tell you how he knew -- that guy sees the future, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CLAIRE: She's beautiful.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Aye, thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CLAIRE: What's her name?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Penny, well, Penelope. How are you feeling?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CLAIRE: Still a little shaken up. I mean, I go swimming almost everyday -- the undertow just grabbed me. I mean, if -- if you hadn't...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE:  Claire? I thought you were only going to be 5 minutes. Aaron's starving.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CLAIRE: Yeah, um, sorry, I...  Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you so much for being there.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: It's my pleasure.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 HURLEY: Locke doesn't know about anything except knives and fishing.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: There's nothing to know. I don't buy this precognitive insanity rubbish. Look, if the bearded wonder could predict the future he wouldn't have ended up here, would he?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE:  Well, whatever happened to him -- we're going to have to find out what it is.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 HURLEY: You do realize he's going to know your plan before you even come up with it, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: In that case,  we're going to have to get him really bloody drunk.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Beautiful evening.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Aye.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 HURLEY:  Say it, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: This morning -- I'm sorry I wasn't more grateful. Thank you for helping Claire not drown.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: No harm done.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Excellent. Brought a peace offering -- you know, make the truce official.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Thanks, but no. I've spent a wee bit too much time drunk as of late.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: This'll be good for us, brother.  Alright, that's fine. We'll take our drink and go somewhere else.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: What kind of whiskey is that?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: It's, uh -- it just says MacCutcheon.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  Alright then, let's have it.  No, the bottle, brother. I mean, if you've come to drink, let's drink.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Alright, let's drink.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Cheers. 
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Cheers.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND AND CHARLIE:  ...she was only the farmer's daughter.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE:  Desi.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Cheers.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 HURLEY: Hey, do you know any songs about drinking and fighting and girls with one leg?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Well, girls with  one leg and a heart of gold.  So, Desi, let me ask you something.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Anything, pal.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE:  How'd you know Claire was drowning?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I could hear her calling for help.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 HURLEY: Oh no you didn't. You were like a mile away.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Well, I suppose I've -- I've got good hearing.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: You hear the lightning, as well?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Excuse me?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: The lightning. Just by chance you pitch your little rod outside Claire's tent -- 2 hours later lightning strikes.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  Thanks for the drink, pal.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE:  Hey, I don't know what you're doing -- you best tell us. Oi! You think because you turned some key that makes you a hero? You're no hero, brother. I don't know how you're doing what it is you're doing, but I know a coward when I see one.  Yeah...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  You don't want to know what happened to me when I turned that key!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Hurley.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 HURLEY: Dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: You don't want to know! And I don't want to know!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Get him off!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: You don't want to know!!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 LOCKE: Desmond!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I'll see you in another life, brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I love you, Penny.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  Des, are you alright? Stay there, hang on.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: I'm just getting ice.  You alright? Sweetie, you okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  What's happening?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Well, what's happening is the result of combining ladders, painting a ceiling, and alcohol. Are you okay? You nauseous?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: This is my flat?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Mmm-hmm, although, if you want me to feel at home you might start calling it our flat. How many fingers, Des?  Love, look at me. What's wrong?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Absolutely nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE:  Here, let me.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Oh, hang on. You've got paint on your neck.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Have I?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: How's that concussion?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Well, my severe head injury is a small price to pay for the pleasure of having you move into my humble -- is rat trap accurate?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Uh-uh.  Voila! You know you don't really need a job from my father, Des.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: It's not about the job. I want him to respect me.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: And respect you he shall. But if for some reason he's too daft to see how brilliant you are it's not the end of the world.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: What did you say?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Here you go, love. You alright?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine -- just had a bit of a deja vu, that's all.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Good afternoon, uh, I'm here to see Mr. Widmore.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 RECEPTIONIST: And you are?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Hume, uh, Mr. Desmond Hume.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DELIVERY MAN:  Hello, love. Got a parcel here for 815.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Excuse me, what did you say?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DELIVERY MAN: I said "delivery for 815."
Lost.Season03.Episode08 RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Hume, Mr. Widmore is ready for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 WIDMORE: Penny didn't tell me you were an actor, Desmond.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: No, it was actually set design for the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 WIDMORE: Impressive. You didn't graduate from university.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: No, sir. I had to look after my 3 brothers after my father--
Lost.Season03.Episode08 WIDMORE: Any military experience?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: No, sir.  She's beautiful -- your boat.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 WIDMORE: My foundation is sponsoring a solo race around the world.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 WIDMORE: Something wrong?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: No. No, sir.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 WIDMORE: Well, Desmond, I'm going to see to it that you have a position in our administrative department. Not the most glamorous duty but it's a start. I'll speak to human resources.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: With all due respect, sir, I haven't come here to interview for a position in your company.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 WIDMORE: You haven't?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: No, sir. I came here to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage. We've been together 2 years now and Pen's moving in and I love her. Your permission would mean everything to me.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 WIDMORE: I'm impressed, Hume -- a very noble gesture.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 WIDMORE: You know anything about whiskey?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: No, I'm afraid not, sir.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 WIDMORE: This is a 60 year MacCutcheon, named after Anderson MacCutcheon, esteemed Admiral from the Royal Navy. He retired with more medals than any man before or since -- moved to the highlands to see out his remaining years. Admiral MacCutcheon was a great man, Hume. This was his crowning achievement.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 WIDMORE: This swallow is worth more than you could make in a month.  To share it with you would be a waste, and a disgrace to the great man who made it -- because you, Hume, will never be a great man.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Mr. Widmore, I know I'm not...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 WIDMORE: What you're not, is worthy of drinking my whiskey. How could you ever be worthy of my daughter?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE:  I said maybe / You're gonna be the one who saves me?  / Maybe / And after all / You're my wonderwall
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE:  Thank you very much. Fiver! Thank you very much.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I know you? How do I know you?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE:  Thank you, you can leave your number if you want.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: How do I know you?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: I don't, uh...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Where do I know you from?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Look, I don't know, but I'll remember if I could get some help.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Hey, can I get some help?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: You're Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Yeah, name's on the sign. 
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  Who -- they -- they. It -- it was in the hatch. I remember seeing you. There was a -- there was a computer. There was a button. We -- we were on an island.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: We are on an island, mate. This is England.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  No, it was real, man. I remember!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Hey, alright.  This is why we don't do drugs.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: No this -- I remember this. This all happened before! Today -- th -- th -- this happened today. This -- I remember that he said I wasn't worthy -- and then I -- and then I -- and then I came down and I -- and I took off my tie and I -- and then I lost my tie and Penny said where was it and then it started to rain and...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DONOVAN: Your thesis is a bit neat. The wild card part which is unpredictability -- run the same test 10 times -- you get 10 different outcomes. It's what makes life so wonderfully...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  Donovan!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DONOVAN: Case in point, who could have known that a drenched Scotsman would appear in this rotunda?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DONOVAN: You've looked better, Des; not much, but I...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  I need to ask you something.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DONOVAN: By all means, do.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: What do you know about time travel?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DONOVAN: Are you bloody insane?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Just tell me if it's possible?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DONOVAN: Which part? The island full of mysterious hatches? Or the computer which keeps the world from ending?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: You know what? Forget you're my best mate, right? As a physicist -- is it possible that I've somehow managed to go back in time and I'm now living my life over again?  It's not funny, Donovan.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DONOVAN: Penny's father berates you for not being a great man, and voila, you've dreamed a future where you push a button to save the world.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: These things are not in my head, brother. I remember things.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DONOVAN: Alright, then -- what happens next?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: It doesn't work like that. I don't remember everything, just -- just bits and pieces.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DONOVAN: How wonderfully convenient.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Wait, I remember this. I know this song. The jukebox...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DONOVAN: Des, you're worrying me now.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I remember this night.  Graybridge come back from 2 goals down in the final 2 minutes and win this game. It's a bloody miracle. And after they win, Jimmy Lennon's going to come through that door and hit the bartender right in the head with a cricket bat because he owes him money.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DONOVAN: Seriously...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Watch, please! Just watch.  They'll score the first goal right now.  No, no, they came back. They won. Jimmy Lennon ... cricket bat.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DONOVAN: There's no such thing as time travel, Des. From what I understand true love can be just as unlikely. So, if you love Penny, stop messing about and marry her.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: You smell like the pub.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: That's because I was at the pub.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: You didn't get the job.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Nope.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: What did my father say?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Your father was lovely. We just both agree that I wasn't exactly qualified.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Well, I say we celebrate. I say we celebrate that fate has spared you a miserable existence under the employ of Widmore Industries. Let me take you out tomorrow. Let's go for lobsters on the pier. My treat.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I don't think my failure to impress your father is any occasion to celebrate.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Well, the occasion is I love you.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Why? Why do you love me?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Because you're a good man. In my experience they're pretty hard to come by.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Hey, Des, where are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I'm right here.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: Never done this before have you?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Is it that obvious?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: I can always tell the first timers. Well, then, may I ask your price range?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I'm not a man of means...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: Oh...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I hope to -- one day...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: I have just the thing.  This won't blind any queens, to be sure, but still has the sparkle of life.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I'll take it.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING:  I'm sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: It's perfect. I'll take it.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: No you won't. Give me the ring. Give it here.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I don't understand.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: This is wrong. You don't buy the ring. You have second thoughts; you walk right out that door. So, come on, let's have it.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I don't know what you're on about.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: You don't buy the ring, Desmond.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: How do you know my name?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: Well, I know your name as well as I know that you that don't ask Penny to marry you. In fact, you break her heart. Well, breaking her heart is, of course, what drives you in a few short years from now to enter that sailing race -- to prove her father wrong -- which brings you to the island where you spend the next 3 years of your life entering numbers into the computer until you are forced to turn that failsafe key. And if you don't do those things, Desmond David Hume, every single one of us is dead. So give me that sodding ring.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING:  Oh, you're going to be difficult about this, I can see.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Who are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: Do you like chestnuts?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: That man over there is wearing red shoes.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: So, what then?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: Just thought it was a bold fashion choice worth noting.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: This isn't really happening, is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: Sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I've had a concussion. You're my subconscious.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING:  Am I?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: You're here to talk me out of marrying Penny. Well, it won't bloody work.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: Oh, yes it will.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: No, there is no island. There is no button. It's madness. I love her. She loves me. I'm going to spend the rest of my life with her.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: No, Desmond, you're not.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Oh, my God. You knew that was going to happen, didn't you?  Then why didn't you stop it? Why didn't you do anything?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: Because it wouldn't matter. Had I warned him about the scaffolding tomorrow he'd be hit by a taxi. If I warned him about the taxi, he'd fall in the shower and break his neck. The universe, unfortunately, has a way of course correcting. That man was supposed to die. That was his path just as it's your path to go to the island. You don't do it because you choose to, Desmond. You do it because you're supposed to.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I'm going to meet Penny in an hour. I've got the ring; she'll say yes; I can choose whatever I want.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 MS. HAWKING: You may not like your path, Desmond, but pushing that button is the only truly great thing that you will ever do.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: How much for the ring?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Hi.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE:  Hey, am I late?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Right on time.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PHOTOGRAPHER: Eh, take your photo, lovebirds?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: No thanks, mate.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PHOTOGRAPHER: Come on, something to show the grandkids.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Oh, come on, Des, let's do it -- for all those grandkids.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PHOTOGRAPHER: Yeah, you're gonna do it? Alrighty. Let's see what we've got for you here, eh?  Ah, beautiful desert scene?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Nah.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PHOTOGRAPHER: No, not the desert, alright. Ah, I know, the Alps.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Ah, I love the Alps.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Oh, I hate the Alps.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PHOTOGRAPHER: Yeah, not the Alps. Ah, here we go -- beautiful marina scene.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Yeah, let's do that.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PHOTOGRAPHER: That's the one, innit? Alright, you guys get in position.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE:  Take your coat off; it's boiling. There are palm trees.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PHOTOGRAPHER: 1-2-3. Instant classic. Only 5 quid.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: Here you go, love.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PHOTOGRAPHER:  Here you go, mate.  Out of 20. You're a lovely couple -- small price to pay for the memories, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  I couldn't go through with it.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: What was that?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I can't do this.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: You can't do what?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Us. This. This relationship.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: How can I? I - I can't look after you. I haven't got a job. I don't have any -- I can't even afford 5 quid for a bloody photograph. You deserve someone better.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: I know what I deserve. I chose to be with you. I love you.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Love's not enough. Being a good man is not enough.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE: What's this about, Des? Where's this coming from?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: It's all happening too soon -- you moving in. You're painting rooms; you're changing things. I don't even like red. Why would you leave your flat, your expensive flat--
Lost.Season03.Episode08 PENELOPE:  Don't do that! Don't you pretend you don't care. And don't you dare rewrite history. I left my expensive flat because you were too proud to live there, remember? If you want me to go -- if you want me to leave then don't make this about what I do or don't deserve. And have the decency to admit that you're doing this because you're a coward.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I'm sorry, Pen, but this -- we're not supposed to be together.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 BARTENDER: What'll it be?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Just give me a pint of your cheapest. I'm celebrating.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 BARTENDER: Oh, what's the occasion?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I think I've made the biggest mistake of my life. And the worst part is I'm pretty sure I've made it before.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 BARTENDER: That's what they call deja vu, mate.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Do they now?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  I had the wrong night. I was right. I was off by a night. I heard the song and then -- I remember this. I'm not crazy. I can still change things. I can still change it.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Jimmy Lennon.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 JIMMY:  Where the hell's my money?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  Hey, duck brother!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: Oh, no. Oh.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  Please, let me go back. Let me go back one more time. I'll do it right. I'll do it right this time. I'm sorry, Penny. I'll change it. I'll change it.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE:  How'd you know Claire was drowning?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: How'd you know Claire was drowning?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I could hear her calling for help.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: You hear the lightning, as well?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE:  Just by chance you pitch your little rod outside Claire's tent -- 2 hours later lightning strikes.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: I don't know how you're doing what it is you're doing, but I know a coward when I see one.  Yeah, a cow...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: You don't want to know what happened to me when I turned that key! You don't want to know!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Get off!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: You don't want to know what happened to me! You don't want to know!
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  You don't want to know. No matter what you do...
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND:  You can't change it. You can't change it no matter what you try to do. You just can't change it.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: He's wankered. Let's get him to his tent. Alright, Des, come on. Give me your arm. Come on stand up. Stand up. Okay, okay.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: You're a good man, Charlie. Listen, I'm sorry I tried to strangle you, alright?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Oh, fair play, mate. Sorry I called you a coward.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: No, you're right, pal.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: Desmond, you are going to tell me what happened to you.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: When I turned that key my life flashed before my eyes. And then I was back in the jungle and still on this bloody island. But those flashes, Charlie -- those flashes -- they didn't stop.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: So, you're telling me you saw a flash of Claire drowning this morning -- that's how you knew how to save her?
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie, I was saving you. This morning you dove in after Claire. You tried to save her but you drowned.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 CHARLIE: What are you talking about? I didn't drown.
Lost.Season03.Episode08 DESMOND: When I saw the lightning hit the roof you were electrocuted. And when you heard Claire was in the water you -- you drowned trying to save her. I dove in myself so you never went in. I've tried, brother. I've tried twice to save you, but the universe has a way of course correcting and -- and I can't stop it forever. I'm sorry. I'm sorry because no matter what I try to do you're going to die, Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER:  Show me the way to go home/I'm tired and I want to go to bed/I had a little drink about an hour ago/And it went straight to my head.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: Stop.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: What, you want a turn steering?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: We have to go back.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: What the hell are you talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: Turn the boat around, Sawyer. I mean it.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Have you lost your mind? We just got away.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: Just do it.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: You give me one good reason to turn around!
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: Because we can't leave Jack behind!
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER:  Yes we can, Freckles, because that's what he asked us to do. You think about it -- if we go back there -- what do you think Captain Bunny Killer's going to do if he catches us?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL:  Kill you.  God loves you as he loves Jacob.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Okay, thanks for the input.  Sorry, kiddo, Jack's on his own.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 TOM: Time to get up. We're moving you.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Moving me where?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 TOM: Some place else, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Why?  So this is it, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 TOM: It?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: You just helped me save his life. If you're going to kill me, at least show me the respect of not calling it "moving."
Lost.Season03.Episode09 TOM: Now, why would we kill you?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Because you're done with me.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 TOM: What kind of people do you think we are, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Oh, I don't know, Tom -- the kind of people that would take a pregnant woman -- that would hang Charlie from a tree -- would drag our people out of the jungle -- would kidnap children. That's the kind of people I think you are.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 TOM:  You see this glass house you're living in, Jack? How about I get you some stones?  Let's do this the easy way -- what do you say?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 THAI BOY: Doctor Jack! Hey, Doctor Jack! Doctor Jack, want soda? Doctor Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 THAI BOY: 
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK:  You know I can't understand a word you're saying, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 THAI BOY: Doctor Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK:  You're welcome.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Thank you. Thank you very much.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: You're not from around here are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK:  No, no I'm not.  I'm Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: Hi, Jack. I'm Achara.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Achara. Achara.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Juliet grilled these for me. Who's that woman?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 TOM: That'd be the sheriff.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: You have a sheriff?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 TOM: Not literally, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Why are you moving Juliet into my room?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 TOM: Because she's in trouble, Jack.  Now don't try anything stupid. Stay put in this cage, okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: You say that like you're not watching me from the camera right there.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 TOM: Oh, right. Ben told me you got into the surveillance room. Let me ask you something. You risk your neck to cut them loose, and they run away and don't ever look back...
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Thanks for the sandwich.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Never thought I'd be glad to get back to this rock again.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: What does it look like? I'm heading into shore.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: Why? If we just keep going we can circle round. Sooner or later we'll get to camp. We can tell Locke and Sayid what happened --
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Oh, we will, huh? You got a map you ain't showing me, Magellan? We've got no food, no water -- and I can't steer in the dark.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: Then I'll steer.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: No, you'll come ashore; we'll make camp. You want to contribute -- you can build a campfire while I carry the kid.  Glad we agree.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER:  Sure you ain't hungry?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: No, James, I ain't hungry.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: You shouldn't fight.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: When the hell did you wake up?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: You shouldn't fight because you're lucky to be alive.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Golly, I think he's got a point.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: That island we were on -- is that where your people live?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: Just where we work.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: Work on what?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: Projects.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Well, sure, like the steal-the-kid-off-the-raft project. That was a humdinger.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: So, you don't actually live on that island?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: Nope.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: Do you live here on this island?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: Yes, ma'am.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: And what did you do with the people that you took - the kids?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: We give them a better life.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: Better than what?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: Better than yours.  There's not going to be any moon tonight. It'll be dark. Me and Alex used to lie in my backyard at night and think up names for the constellations. You can't see it yet, but right there will be Ursa Theodorus - the Teddy Bear.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: You have backyards?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Well, ain't that quaint.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: I thought you were locked up.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: They let me out to examine Ben. His vitals are low and he has a fever.  I took this about 10 minutes ago. It's of his stitches. They're infected aren't they?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: Will you come look at them?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: I'm not asking you for them, or him. I'm asking you as a personal favor to me.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: You want me to help him again?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK:  Are you sure about that, Juliet?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: Yes, I'm sure.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: And this is because he said that he would let you go home.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: No. No. It's because I'm in trouble.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Trouble for --
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: I just killed someone. It's why they put me in your room.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Who?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: It's complicated.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Well, then, let me simplify it for you. I'm not going to help him. And I'm not going to help you.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 CHET:  Okay, special Thai dish for you. You try.  Very brave. Very brave. 
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: My brother likes you.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Well, I'm a very likable guy.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: So, Jack, tell me something.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Shoot.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: Why is it you don't know how to fly a kite?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Just never learned, I guess.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: That's very sad.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Well, my dad worked a lot and wasn't exactly the kite-flying type, anyway. I mean, we never really --
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: I have no interest in your father.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Well, that's a relief because I'm pretty tired of talking about him.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: Some things are personal. So, you're in Phuket to find yourself.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Why would you say that?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: You are an American.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 THAI MAN:  
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: 
Lost.Season03.Episode09 THAI MAN:  
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: 
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: I have a gift.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Must be one hell of a gift.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ISABEL:   Oh, I was just reading your tattoos. The 5 and the stars are very cute. But the Chinese I find a bit ironic.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: You find what ironic?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ISABEL: What it says. You do know what it says?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Yeah, I know what it says.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ISABEL: Are you sure? Chinese is a very complicated language. It's fairly common for some things to get lost in translation.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: I know what it says.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ISABEL: Alright, then. Jack, my name is Isabel. If you'll come with me, I'd like to talk to you and ask you a few questions.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ISABEL: Why don't you check on your father, sweetheart? I know he'd appreciate it.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ISABEL: Please, have a seat, Jack. As you may have gathered, we don't live on this little island. In fact, most of us don't really like even coming here. There's been an incident that I'm investigating and I need to ask you some questions. So, I was hoping you might help me clear up a few of the inconsistencies. Now correct me if I'm wrong, Tom. But you said that in the midst of a surgical procedure Jack made several comments indicating that Juliet had asked him to kill Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 TOM: Yeah, that's right.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ISABEL: That true, Jack? Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?  The question's simple. Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK:  No. No, I was lying. I would have done anything to get my friends out. And turning you people against each other was my best chance of creating chaos.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ISABEL: Why are you lying for her, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: I'd like to go back to my cage now.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Who's there?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA:  Who do you think?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: What time is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA:  It's late.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Mmm, salty.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: I went for a swim in the ocean.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Washing the day off of you, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: Is there something you'd like to ask me, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: No. I mean, it might be nice -- after a month of you coming and going whenever you want -- to find out something about you.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: There are things that happen here that you could never understand.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Like your gift?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: Yes, like my gift.  Are you having fun with me, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Oh, yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: Then stop ask questions. Let's have fun.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK:  What?!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode09 CINDY:  Hey, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Do I -- do I know you? 815, you were the stewardess.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 CINDY: Cindy.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: What are you doing here -- with them? I thought you were taken -- you were -- you were captured.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 CINDY: They're not, um -- it's not that simple.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: What are they doing here, right now? What are you doing here?!!
Lost.Season03.Episode09 CINDY: We're here to watch, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Watch what?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 CINDY: What is it, sweetheart?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 CINDY: She wants to know how Ana Lucia's doing.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Are you serious?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 CINDY: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK:  If you've got something to watch, Cindy, go watch it!! Go!!
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: Sawyer. Sawyer, wake up. He's gone. Karl's gone.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Where?  Hold up.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: I got it.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: No, let me talk to him.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: I got it -- boys only.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: Ow!! What the hell was that for?!
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: So you'd cowboy up. Crying in the jungle -- I thought you people were supposed to be tough.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL:  I am tough.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Sure you are, Bobby.  Bobby, the Brady Bunch?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: What the hell's the Brady Bunch?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Okay, anyway look, Karl -- I've been with a lot of girls -- some of them worth the trouble, some not. Every now and again there's one -- one you name dumb stars with. So this girl, Sally Slingshot --
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: Alex.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Yeah. Do you love her?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: More than anything.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Then go back to wherever the hell your yards are and get her back.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KARL: If I get caught -- they'll kill me this time.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Well, at least it'll be worth it.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ALEX: I want to ask you something. They're not watching anymore so you can tell me the truth.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Okay.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ALEX: Ben -- why'd you save his life? All this time -- after all he did to you and your people you should hate him. But you still fixed him up, even after your friends got away. Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: You're his daughter.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ALEX: Answer the question.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: I'll answer your question if you answer one of mine. Where's Juliet?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ALEX: She's with the rest of them. They're going to read her verdict.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Her verdict?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ALEX: And we all know what it's going to be. We're pretty strict about killing one of our own. Eye for an eye.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Who did she kill?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ALEX: The man who was going to murder your friends. No wonder you're so worried about her. If it wasn't for you she never would have done it. That was 3 questions. Your turn, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: I saved your father because I said I would.  Hey, hey! Is he still in charge?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ALEX: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Ben, your father, is he still in charge? Will that woman, Isabel, do what he says?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ALEX: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Get me out of this cage.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: I wouldn't do that!
Lost.Season03.Episode09 BEN: The cavalry has arrived, at last.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: I'd be more impressed with you people if you had a good surgeon.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 BEN: We had an excellent surgeon, Jack. His name was Ethan.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: You've got a very serious infection, Ben. That infected tissue needs to be reincised, debrided; and you need to be closely monitored from here on out. There might be nerve damage or any number of other complications. You might not walk again.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 BEN: Your bedside manner leaves something to be desired.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Well, then it's too bad you're stuck with me.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 BEN: Am I?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: You need a doctor, Ben -- someone to stay with you -- bring you back to good health.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 BEN: And, here we go again. I've already given you a ticket off this island, Jack. What's it going to cost me this time?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Right now, your people are in a room deciding whether or not to execute Juliet. You're going to stop it.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 BEN: Juliet doesn't care about you, Jack. It doesn't matter what she's done. No matter what you think -- she's one of us.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Do we have a deal or not?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 BEN:  Does Isabel have a walkie?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ALEX: They're already in the meeting.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 BEN: Then get me something to write on.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: You followed me.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: What is all this?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: This is where I work. And you shouldn't be here.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: This is, uh, a tattoo parlor. That was your big secret? The envelopes? Your gift?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: I am not a tattoo artist. I am able to see who people are. My work is not decoration; it is definition. And this, this is my gift.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: So you see who people are?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: Yes, and I mark them.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: So tell me who I am.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA:  No.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Why not?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: You are an outsider.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: So you can sleep with me?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: I'm not allowed.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Do you see who I am, Achara?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Who am I?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: You are a leader, a great man. But this, this makes you lonely, and frightened, and angry.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Now, put it on me. Put it on me.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: No. This, this is against my people.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ACHARA: There will be consequences, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: There always are.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ALEX:  No, you shouldn't be here. Just stand back. Don't say anything.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 TOM: Alex. Jack! What the hell did you bring him here for?!!
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ISABEL: Let him go, Tom. What's going on, Alex?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ALEX:  This is from Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ISABEL:  Ben has commuted Juliet's sentence. Execution is off the table. He says the rules don't apply. He has, however, ordered her to be marked.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Where you going?!
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Hey, I know you.  I'm Achara's friend from -- Chet, from the restaurant.  Let go of me, man.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 CHET: You will get off our beach!! You will leave this country!! Do you understand me?!
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: I heard you only liked them grilled.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: I miss the toothpicks, too.  Let me see.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: They mark you? Let me see it?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Break a branch off that aloe plant over there...
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: It's okay, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Please, please do it.  Turn around.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: Why did you help me?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: He told you he was going to let you go home. He told me the same thing. We're going to make sure he keeps his word.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: And how are we going to do that?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Together.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: They'll be coming for you in a few minutes. All of them. Your friends know where we are so we have to leave this island to go back to where we live.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: Go where?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JULIET: Well, Ben calls it home.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: Where's Karl?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: I let him go.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: You what?!
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: I let him go.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: He could have led us back to where they live.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: What, you think I cut him loose because I'm so damn sensitive? The kid's a target! Ben ain't never going to stop looking for him so as long--
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: All Ben wants is that kid as far from his daughter as possible.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Let's get back to camp.  Well, are you coming, or not?
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: Should I walk beside you, or ten paces behind you? You've gotten so good at telling me what to do, I can't think for myself anymore.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Don't take it out on me because you feel guilty.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: I don't feel guilty.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: The hell you don't.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: We had to leave Jack behind. I didn't have a choice.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: I'm not talking about leaving Jack behind. I'm talking about you and me. I know you did it because you thought I was a dead man. So don't beat yourself up because the Doc's left behind.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 KATE: I'm not beating myself up.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 SAWYER: Of course you're not. So, now that we got that out of the way, let's go.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 ISABEL:  "He walks amongst us, but he is not one of us." Your tattoos -- that's what they say.
Lost.Season03.Episode09 JACK: That's what they say. It's not what they mean.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: You got that thing running yet, buddy?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 YOUNG HURLEY: Naw, but I got your tools all set.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Let's see if we can get this thing started, okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 YOUNG HURLEY: I thought we needed a new carburetor?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Well, maybe we don't. Come on, slide behind the wheel. Let's fire this up.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: What's the matter? Go ahead.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 YOUNG HURLEY: It's stupid. Without a new carburetor it's not going to work.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Having hope is never stupid. You've got to believe good things will happen and then they will. You understand what I'm saying?  In this world, son, you've got to make your own luck. Alright, come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 YOUNG HURLEY:  Well, what do you want to fix today?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID:  We're going to have to put that on hold for a little while because, um, I've got to go to Vegas. You know, I've got some work out there.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 YOUNG HURLEY: What about the road trip?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: The Grand Canyon will still be there when I get back, little dude. Hey, I've got something for you. 
Lost.Season03.Episode10 YOUNG HURLEY: Um, I'm not supposed to, mom says.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Live a little, Hugo. It's just a candy bar.  Alright, I'll be back before you know it. Hold down the fort? You're my man? Alright.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: So then, the Others take the bags off our heads and we're, like, on the other side of the island. And they take Jack, Kate and Sawyer someplace and they sent me back to warn everyone to stay away. Which I did. And now everyone's freaked out. With them gone -- and what happened to Eko -- they're all scared. And I'm scared. But then, I've been scared most of my time here anyway, except when I'm with you. I miss you, Libby.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Bloody hell.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Dude, you okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Peachy.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Really? Because you've kind of been moping...
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Look, it's not worth talking about, Hurley. Okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: You can tell me anything.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Desmond told me I was going to die. He told me has these flashes -- visions, whatever -- and in them I always die.  So this is the part where you tell me it is ridiculous, don't be daft, he's a nutter.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: I think he might be right. And I think it might be my fault.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Your fault?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: I'm kind of cursed. Death finds me, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Vincent? Is that an arm?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Here, Vincent. Come here.  I think we need to get that.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Yeah, chase the dog with the skeletal arm into the creepy jungle. You be my guest.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Okay, if I'm not back in 3 hours tell somebody.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Vincent! Vincent, come here. Vincent.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Awesome.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 TRICIA: It's everyone's fantasy -- winning the lottery -- untold millions falling into your lap overnight. What would you do with all that money? Well, one such lucky winner recently bought a chicken shack. I'm Tricia Tanaka with Hugo Reyes, winner of a record 140 million dollars, outside Mr. Clucks Chicken in Diamond Bar which will be having its grand re-opening tomorrow. So, Hugo, I think the question on everyone's mind is: why did you buy Mr. Clucks?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY:  Uh, I like chicken.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 TRICIA: Um, also with us is Hugo's former boss, and now employee, Randy Nation. That's probably every working stiff's fantasy, isn't it, Mr. Reyes?  Um, okay, so, Hugo, tell us what else you've done since you got on your lucky streak?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Actually, I've kind of had some bad luck, too. My grandpa Tito died of a heart attack and the first house I bought my mom burnt down. My friend Johnny ran off with my girlfriend, Starla. Oh, and this guy jumped off my accountant's roof.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 TRICIA: Cut!  What the hell was that?! It's a puff piece, Mr. Reyes, do you know what that is?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Yeah. Sorry, Tricia Tanaka.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 TRICIA: Um, do you mind if we go inside and shoot some B-roll?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Oh, I don't know.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 RANDY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course you can. He's just superstitious. You know, the ribbon isn't cut yet.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 TRICIA:  Okay, let's go. Ugh, god I hate this.  I always get the stupid stories...
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY:  Hey, you sure it's okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 RANDY: Yeah, relax.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: The safety guards are on the fryers?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 RANDY: Those fryers are stone cold, alright? We don't even start cooking until tomorrow.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Do you hear something?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 TRICIA: And then pan through the...
Lost.Season03.Episode10 PAULO: Well, we are out of DHARMA Oat Bars.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 NIKKI: Already?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 PAULO: Yep.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 NIKKI: Did you check behind the powdered milk?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 PAULO: Yes, it's not there.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SUN: Will you pass me the box of cereal?  Will you pass me the box of cereal?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: 무슨 말을 하는지 모르겠어.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SUN: From now on I will only speak to you in English. It's how you will learn.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: 아, 왜 이래.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SUN: It will be hard at first.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN:  싫다니까?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Hey! Hey! Hey everyone! Hey!!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CLAIRE: Hurley, what is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 PAULO: Is it the Others?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CLAIRE: Hurley, are you okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 PAULO: What's going on man?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY:  Car! I found a car tipped over in the jungle.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 NIKKI: You found a car?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: And we could totally fix it and get it going again. It's not far, come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 PAULO: Why do we need to start a car?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Because it'll be fun.  We could all use some fun. I mean, after everything's that happened we need it.  Especially you, dude. So who's with me?!!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 PAULO: Well, I've got to cut some bananas. Sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: I don't think so, Hurley.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Come on. Anyone. We're going to drive it! Who's coming?!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Thanks, dude.  You have no idea what you volunteered for, do you?  Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Are we there yet?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: If we are where I think we are then our beach should be just through those trees. We'll be home in about 5 minutes.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Try to contain your excitement, Freckles.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: Forgive me if I'm not excited about explaining why there's only two of us coming back, James.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Maybe they should explain why they ain't come looking for us. In fact, I'd be surprised if Locke--  Ow, ow, ow.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: I stepped on something. Son-of-a-bitch!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: Looks like a dart.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: How the hell did it get out here?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: Alright, just relax your foot for a second, okay? I'm going to pull it out. On the count of 3. Ready? 1 -- .
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Ow!!! I thought you said "3"?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: Yeah, well, anticipation's the worst part. I thought I would spare you.  You know, all you have to do is say sorry. You could start again -- give each other a clean slate.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER:  Slate. Like on Little House?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Little House on the Prairie? Laura Ingalls used to write on this little chalkboard at school.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE:  You call it Little House?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: I had mono when I was a kid -- missed 2 months of school -- we only got one channel in my trailer.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: What are we even talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER:  We ain't talking about nothing. 
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: James?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: And I ain't got nothing to be sorry for.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: So that's how it's going to be? Welcome home, Sawyer. 
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Welcome home, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: Hugo! Hugo, is that you? Oh my god, what happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Tricia Tanaka is dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Mr. Clucks got hit by a meteor, or an asteroid. I don't know the difference but it's gone.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: That's crazy.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: It's not crazy. It's the lottery money, the numbers, I'm cursed. And now Tricia Tanaka's dead, and her camera dude, and it's all my fault.  Ow!!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: It was an accident.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: It's not an accident. It is a curse. There's only one way to stop it. I have to go to Australia.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: Again with Australia.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: That's where the numbers came from. Lenny, in the institution, he told me.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: Hugo, Hugo wait. I can prove to you you're not cursed.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: You can?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: Yes. Come here with me. I have to show you something.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Hey, Hugo!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: After 17 years your father has returned.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID:  Hey, your mom wasn't kidding about those candy bars.  Just kidding.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Poor, Roger. Sorry about your arm, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN:  Hurley! 이것 봐. In, In.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Totally. Let's check it out. 
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Dude, Roger was on a beer run.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN:  시체 꺼내자.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: I suck at charades. You want to what?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN:  아냐, 아냐.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Oh, you want to take Roger out?  And turn it over.  I understand!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Okay, on 3. 1-2-3.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: We'll get that later.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: So, when's it going to happen?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DESMOND: When's what going to happen?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Don't play stupid with me, brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DESMOND: I was drunk. Now if I said anything...
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: I have a right to know when I'm going to die.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DESMOND: It doesn't work like that.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: What doesn't work like that?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER:  Hey, Oliver Twist, where the hell's my stuff?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: What stuff?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Oh, you know good and damn well what stuff! I had books, food, porno, a bottle of scotch.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DESMOND: Aye, apologies for the scotch, mate.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: You drank it?!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DESMOND: Well, to be fair there was -- there was 3 of us.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Yeah, there was.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: You, the Munchkin, and who else?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN:  이렇게, 응? 이렇게.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Oh, I got it. You're going to tip it up. Crafty.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: Crafty?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Yeah, crafty. It's like, when you're good at ... crafts. Nevermind.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER:  Hey, where the hell's my stuff?  What are you all doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY:  Dude! You're alive!! You're alive.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER:  Yeah, yeah, Snuffy. Good to see you, too. I'll be damned, you all found yourselves a hippy car.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Pretty cool, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN:  Sawyer.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Jin-bo. How are you going?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: Good see you.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Well, look at that. Somebody's hooked on phonics.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: What about Jack and Kate? Are they with you? Are they alright?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Kate's with me, but the Doc -- they've still got him.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Okay. It's okay. It's going to be alright. Jack's going to be alright. We all are.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Well, what a relief.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Naw, see, things are getting better. The car, you coming back safely -- it's a sign.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Yeah, a sign I want my stuff back.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Uh-uh. You're going to help us fix this thing.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Now why would I do that?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Because there's beer.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAYID: Why did he say "don't come back?"
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: He sacrificed himself so we could escape. He probably didn't want it to be for nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAYID: Hurley told us they released Michael and Walt.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: Yep. They gave Michael a boat. He took off and never looked back.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAYID: Did you see any other boats?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: No, but something tells me they didn't give away their only one.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LOCKE: So they can leave the island?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: I don't know, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAYID: This zoo where they held you, is that where they live?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE:  We escaped with one of them -- a kid named Karl -- he says that they live on this island. He could have taken us there but Sawyer let him go.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAYID: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: You're going to have to ask Sawyer. 
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAYID: Kate, where are you going?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: I don't care what Jack said. They've got him and we've got to get him back. I owe him that. I'm going to get help.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LOCKE: Help from who?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Now, that's a hell of a Jesus.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: Yes, Hugo's such a good son. He knows of my love for the savior, so he commissioned artisans in Taxco to custom carve for me this statue in solid gold.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Ah, that smells like great lasagna.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: The Tranhs made it themselves. Hugo found them in Bennigans. Now they are our butlers.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Something wrong, Hugo?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: Your father asked you a question, Hugo.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: My father? You're acting like he never left us -- like he hasn't been gone for 17 years. And all the sudden he shows up? Are you at least a little suspicious?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: I showed up because your mom called and said you were in trouble.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: What?!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: All those numbers and curses. Hugo, I don't know what to do anymore. I thought you needed a manly influence, a father, to get you stop this nonsense.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: I'm not crazy. And the only reason he's back is because he wants the money.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Well, now that hurts.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Well, guess what? There isn't going to be any money. Mr. Tranh? Lady Tranh? Your services will no longer be needed.  Severance. Trust me, I'm doing you a huge favor. It's only a matter of time before the curse gets you, and you die, or worse.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: Hugo, what are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Getting rid of it. All of it -- the money, the houses, the livestock -- and I'm starting with him.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: No, Hugo. Your father is staying with us.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: He's staying with us? Where?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: It's been 17 years, Hugo.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: What's been 17 years?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: I have needs.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY:  No! No! No! This can't be happening. He has to go! He has to. I want him gone!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: No you don't.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Yeah, I do.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CARMEN: Why don't you go show your father what you have in the garage? Hugo?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: I can't believe it. You saved it. You saved it.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER:  Me first, now, come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: What the hell is up with all this recycling?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: You got me, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Looks like those DHARMA freaks were building some sort of dirt road.  Woo, now we're talking.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN:  이거 고치려면 시간 많이 걸리겠는데?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Looks good to me. Engine's fine, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER:  Son-of-a -- what's a head doing back here?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Oh, that's just Roger.  I'm going to start the car now.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: 아니, 아직 하지 마. 엔진부터 먼저 확인해야지.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Dude, even if you were speaking English, I wouldn't understand a word you were saying. Just relax; we're good. This'll work.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: I have hope. This will work.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY:  Damn it.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER:  Hoh, it's flat and it stinks.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY:  Can you get it to work? Do you know what's wrong?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Chill out; let the man do his thing.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Dude, that beer's been sitting there since before Rocky III, maybe even II. It's probably poison by now.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER:  Skeletor seems to like it.  Bottoms up.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: That's not cool, dude. That guy had a mom, a family, and friends. Oh, and a name, it's not skeletor, it's Roger Workman.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: It's Work Man, you blockhead. That's his job. He was a DHARMA janitor.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Yeah, well you should still respect the dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: 배터리가 완전히 죽었어. 아무래도...
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, can you fix it?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: No. No fix.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: But you have to! Can't you try, dude? I mean, we've got to get this thing running.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Leave the man alone. He's right, "no fix." Take a look at that mess -- no way it's going to get running. How thick are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: What's your problem, man? Why don't you want this to work?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: I don't care if it works. Why is it so important to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Because we could all use a little hope.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: If it's hope you're looking for ese, you're on the wrong damn island. There sure as hell ain't no hope here.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Rise and shine; hit the deck. We're burning daylight; let's go.  What's with the earphones?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: It's for the noise.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Well, your mother's a very passionate woman.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: That is disgusting.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Come on, we're going on an adventure. Let's go.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: I'm not going anywhere with you.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Come on, just do this one thing with me. If it doesn't work, you can go to Australia. I won't stop you, okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: What "one thing?"
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: We're going to break the curse.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: This is stupid.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Just give it a chance, man.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LYNN:  Cut the deck please.  You've recently come into a great deal of money.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: You could have seen that on the news.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LYNN:  But it hasn't brought you happiness. No, it's brought you great misfortune.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: She didn't see that on the news.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LYNN: I'm seeing numbers.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: What numbers?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LYNN: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. There's darkness around these numbers. Great tragedy.  I'm sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Why? What is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LYNN: Death surrounds you; and more is coming. Your hands, please. There's a curse on you. But it can be removed.  Now, Hugo, I need you to remove your clothes.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: My clothes?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LYNN:  A curse is like an unwelcome entity that lives inside you. And it must be exorcised.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Did my dad put you up to this?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LYNN: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Hugo, please.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: I'll give you a thousand dollars right now if you admit that my dad told you to say this stuff.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LYNN: The mystic arts are not subject to bribes. How dare you!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: 10,000.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LYNN: Your dad put me up to it.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: I was just trying to help.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Help who?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Beer.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: Beer.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Bingo. Beautiful.  Car.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: Car.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER:  International House of Pancakes.  What are you doing over there?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: I'm praying.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Praying for what?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Help.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Well, hell, I've got you a little help right here.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Dude. Hey, dude, stop moping. Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Not moping -- thinking.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Uh-uh. When people stare out at the ocean and get all quiet-like? They're moping. So get up and come with me. That car I found? We're getting it running.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: What's the point?  Ow! What did you do that for?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Snap out of it! Stop feeling sorry for yourself because someone said you're going to die. I've got an idea that's going to help us both.  Now, it is dangerous. And there's a very good chance that you will die.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: That's supposed to convince me to come with you?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: It is. Because if you don't die, then we win.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Win?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Look, I don't know about you, but things have really sucked for me lately and I could use a victory. So let's get one, dude. Let's get this car started. Let's look death in the face and say, "whatever, man." Let's make our own luck. What do you say?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Okay, nice. Keep it coming.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: You were right.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Okay. That's two. Hit me.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: Those pants don't make you look fat.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Now you got it -- only three things a woman needs to hear.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY:  Come on. Get up; we've got work to do.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: What's your problem, Jumbotron.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Shut up! Red -- neck -- man.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Touché.  What is Jiminy Cricket doing here?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: We need another man.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Another man for what?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: To push this car, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Push it? Push it where?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Oh, this is going to be real good.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: So, you're going to Australia, huh?  Long way to go because of some stupid numbers.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: I'd really like you to leave.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: When your mom called me about the lottery I was on my bike before she could hang the phone up. I'm getting old. Yeah, I saw my retirement. You're right. I'm here for the money.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Well, you're not getting any of it.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: That's not why I'm here talking to you now. I'm here talking to you now because going to Australia's not going to break any curse. You don't need to leave. You just -- you need a little hope. We make our own luck, Hugo. You know what I think you should do?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: I think you should give away the money. All of it, every penny. Just save enough for a new carburetor -- work on the Camaro -- you know, just you and me -- take it off the blocks and make that road trip to the Grand Canyon. Never too late for a fresh start.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: I'll send you a postcard from Sydney. 
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DAVID: Hey, I'll -- I'll be here when you get back.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Are you nuts? You're not going to drive down that.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: We're going to jumpstart it. You guys are going to push it. And then on the way down I'm going to pop the clutch and get it started.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: You see those rocks? All you're going to do is crash into those real fast. If you don't roll over first.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN: Hurley, no.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Dudes, I know how to drive. Now come on, just push me. This'll work; I know it.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER:  What are you out here for -- watch him crash and burn?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Came to ride shotgun.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Well, it's your funeral.  Come on, let's give 'em their ride.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY:  Are you sure you want to do this?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Victory or death.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Push!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: Oh, jeez.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Careful now.  Now would be a good time, Hurley. Like right now!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: There is no curse. You make your own luck.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 CHARLIE: Hurley!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 HURLEY: You make your own luck. There is no curse!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAWYER: Son-of-a-bitch.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 JIN:  Hurley!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAYID: Kate, if you were looking for help to find Jack why didn't you ask us?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: Two reasons -- you don't know where to look and you're not motivated. And I don't blame you. Why would you want to go on another trek across the island, risk more lives just to get Jack back?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LOCKE: You're wrong.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: Oh, really? Then why didn't you come after--
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LOCKE: Not about the motivation, just about knowing where to look. We got a compass bearing, and I'm pretty sure if we follow it it'll lead us right to him.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: How?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 SAYID:  Because of the way the sunlight hit Mr. Eko's stick when John was burying him.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 LOCKE: So now you know our secret, how about you tell us yours?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: No, no, no, don't shoot. Don't shoot.  It's alright! It's safe! We're just here to talk! You can come out!
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DANIELLE: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: I came to ask for your help.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DANIELLE: To do what?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: I'm heading to the Other's camp, and if I'm going to find it, I need someone who knows the island.
Lost.Season03.Episode10 DANIELLE: What makes you think I have an interest in helping you?
Lost.Season03.Episode10 KATE: Because they had me, and they would have never let me go -- probably would have killed me if I hadn't escaped. And the girl who helped me escape -- she was about 16 years old and her name was Alex. I'm pretty sure that she's your daughter.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Ping-pong table? Where the hell did that come from?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: Jin found it when he was out looking for firewood. We made legs for it, paddles, now all we need is a ball.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Found it?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: It must've landed in the jungle when the hatch exploded.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: I thought the hatch collapsed.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: Look, dude, all I know is the sky turned purple. After that I don't ask questions. Just make myself a salad and move on.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Yeah, I can see that's working for you. Hey! You seen Kate around?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: Wow. She's not back yet? Hmm.  You guys find anything we could use as a ball?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 BACKGROUND VOICE: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER:  Hey, that's my Guns and Ammo. Where the hell you get it?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 PAULO: It was in the magazine stack. We share things now.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Listen, Zorro, it was in my stuff. Stuff you all decided to have yourselves a little party with while you thought I was dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 PAULO: Listen, hillbilly, if you want it that bad, take it. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Just keep it. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: We need to eat.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Are we still on course?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: We're still heading north on a bearing of 3 0 5. Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm sensing a lack of confidence.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: We've been walking for two days, following a compass bearing provided by the carvings on a stick!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: And?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: You really think we're just going to chance upon where The Others are?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: I don't know what we're going to chance upon, Sayid, but my bearing is the only bearing we got.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I'm going to find some fruit, and then, John, we'll have a rational conversation regarding our next move.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: You all looking for something like this? 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: Cool, the ball. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Uh-uh. We need to do a quick prid quo first. I know I've been gone a while, and you thought the General Store was having a "going-out-of-business" sale. But now I'm back. And I want what’s mine.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 NIKKI: Yeah, but it wasn't really yours to begin with.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: A, it was mine to begin with when I took it. B, who the hell are you? And C, because I'm fair, I'm going to let you play me for it.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: Play ping pong?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: That's right, Avalanche. You bastards put up your best player. One game. And when I crush them, you all gotta bring me every piece of my stash back.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: If you lose?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: I ain't gonna lose, but if I do, tell you what, name it.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 JIN: 소이어가 뭐래?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SUN: 잠깐만, 내가 나중에 얘기 해 줄게. 나한테 좋은 생각이 생겼어.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Ooh, looks like crouching tiger and hidden dragon got something good. Lay it on me.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SUN: No nicknames. If you lose, no nicknames for anyone for a week.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 CHARLIE: Nice!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: You're on. Pick your player. I'll be back in an hour, then let the slaughter begin.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: You sure it's completely isolated?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I've circled the house. Nothing but jungles surrounding it. Here. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Does that dish still work?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: A satellite dish of that size would have broadcasting capabilities for thousands of miles. Danielle, you once mentioned a radio tower. Is this it?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 ROUSSEAU: I have never been here before.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: The man in the house, you said you've seen him before?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: On a video feed from the Pearl Station.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: So who is he?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Only one way to find out. We ask him. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: What's this for?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: If I'm unarmed, he won't feel threatened. In case he is threatened, you cover me from here.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: Hey, where are you going?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 ROUSSEAU: I have no interest in that man inside the house. I have survived on the island precisely by avoiding these types of encounters. I'll wait for you by the stream, for those of you who survive.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 ARABIC MAN: Najeev. Najeev.  A man out front wants to see you.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: Did you cook this?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Yes, I did.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: Wow, it is delicious. My name is Sami.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Najeev. Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: Please sit. Sit. Where are you from, Najeev?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I'm Syrian.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: Please. والله يااخي, انت مبين عليك كثير انك عراقي مثلي.  
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: What do you want from me?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: You're an excellent cook. And I, I have a restaurant. Much nicer than this place. Come take a look. If you like it, I will hire you at twice your pay here.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: You're offering a stranger a job because of a single meal?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: I'm offering you a job because we're outsiders here. And because, um, my chef just quit.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: No, he's been hit. He's been hit.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Not yet. Do you want to get shot too?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: I didn't cross the line! We had a truce! This is my land! You said I could stay here!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I'm not who you think I am! My name is Sayid Jarrah! I was on a plane that crashed here months ago!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: A plane?!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I'm unarmed, I swear!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Stay right there!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Drop the rifle! Stop, right now. Back up. Back up. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE:  Are you all right?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: You really did crash here?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Over 40 of us, yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: I'll go in first. Make sure it's ok.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: Who are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: My name is Mikhail Bakunin and I am the last living member of the DHARMA Initiative.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: Watch your step.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Please. Sit. Here, let me... 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: You've had experience treating gunshot wounds?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: I spent some time in Afghanistan. I had experience with field medicine in the Soviet Army.  In the kitchen, on the top shelf there is a medical kit. Will you bring it please?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: It's alright, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: How did you get here?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: I almost don't know where to begin.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Why don't you begin with the DHARMA Initiative.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: I grew up in Kiev and joined the Soviet Army. I was stationed at a listening post at Vladivostok. After the Cold War, after we lost the Cold War, my unit was decommissioned. I was dismissed from my life in the military. And after years of conducting unpleasant actions against our enemies, I found myself wanting to do something good. So I replied to a newspaper advertisement.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: An advertisement?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: 'Would you like to save the world?' it read. That's how I met them, the Initiative. They're very secretive, very rich, very smart.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: So, when did you come to the island?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: 11 years now. I like computers, communications equipment, being alone like a lighthouse keeper. So they put me in this station. They called it The Flame.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: What is the purpose of the flame?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: To communicate with the outside world, of course.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 COMPUTER VOICE: Ready to play? Ready to play?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 COMPUTER VOICE: Your move.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: What happened to the DHARMA Initiative?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: They're all dead, of course. They foolishly initiated a war against The Hostiles, the purge they called it.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: How did you survive this purge?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: By not participating in it. I told you, I like being alone.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: And the hostiles allowed you to stay here?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: After it was over, four men appeared in the yard. They offered a truce. They said to imagine a line that extended all the way across the valley. As long as I did not cross it, I would be left alone. Then they took two cows and I never saw them again.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: They weren't interested in the satellite dish in the yard?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Why would they be? It hasn't functioned for years.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Who are they, these Hostiles?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: I do not know. But they were here a long time before we were. A very long time.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I am looking for Sami.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MAN: Sami!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: Najeev! I'm so glad you came. What do you think? It's a simple place. We have simple customers.  Ah, here's my wife. She is in charge of the kitchen. Amira, come meet the chef.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Pleasure to meet you.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI:  Are you sure this is him?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 AMIRA: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Look, I do not know who you think I am--
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: What did you just say?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: I told Nadia to be polite because you are my guests.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Nadia?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Mm hmm. After Nadia Comaneci, the greatest athlete the world has ever known. We have the same birthday. Excellent work if I say so myself.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Thank you, Mikhail
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Perhaps I can begin to earn your forgiveness by offering you some iced tea. I will also check on your friend.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Ha! Don't waste your time. For ten years I have tried to defeat that game. But it was programmed by three grand masters. And it cheats.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Hmm. Well, I've played a lot of computers and I'm pretty sure they don't know how to cheat. That's what makes being human so distinctly wonderful.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: What's wrong?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: It just doesn't make any sense. Why would they let him stay here with all this stuff, all this equipment?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Actually it makes perfect sense.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: The reason they let him stay here is because he is not DHARMA. He is one of them.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: He shot you and you just let him- Why are we still sitting here?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: We are sitting here, Kate, because I am certain he is not alone.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: So, you really the number one draft pick, Grimace?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: Yep. Are we playing with the mercy rule?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Mercy rule?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: Yeah, if I am like up 11-0 I, you know, automatically win.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: You're going to go up 11-0.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: Well, any one of us.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Sure, we can have a mercy rule.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: Wanna volley for serve?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Tell you what, you can be my guest.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 CHARLIE: Take him down, Hurley!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: 0 serving 0.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 CHARLIE: Yes!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: 1-Nothing
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: I grow the tea myself. So pardon its bitterness.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Any tea is good tea.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: You know how long it's been since we've seen ice?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I noticed a series of thick wires as I walked around the station.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: This is the hub. But they go around to various stations on the island.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: And these cables, do any of them run into the ocean?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Yes. There is an underwater beacon that emits sonar pings to help guide in the vessels.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: By vessels, you mean submarines.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Yes. The Initiative used it to bring us to the island. But I can only imagine that the Hostiles have either destroyed it or commandeered it by now.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: That explains how they were able to get around my position and capture our sailboat.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: You have a sailboat?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Until we lost it to your Hostiles.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: That's very unfortunate.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Well, at least we were able to kill one of them.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Why are we continuing to play this little game when we all know it has moved to the next stage?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Get some rope.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: Drink.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: You were a torturer, were you not, in the Republican Guard? Do you not recognize one of your victims? Do you not recognize the woman you tortured? Do you not recognize my WIFE?!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: No I have never seen- You are confusing me with someone else.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: Amira was arrested for harboring an enemy of the state. She was held for three months while she was questioned. Her arms bear the scars of those questions. So I assure you, Najeev, I am NOT confused.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: My name is not Najeev. I'm Sayid Jarrah. I was in the Republican Guard and, yes, I was an interrogator. But I have never seen your wife. Maybe she saw me at the same facility, but I do not know her. I can remember every face of every person I interrogated.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: She remembers your face. She remembers it so well that she recognized you from a mere glimpse as we walked by the restaurant where you worked!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: What do you want from me?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: I want you to admit what you did. And if you don't, you will leave this room in a bag.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: How do you know he is not alone?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: The horse is still saddled outside, and the stirrups are set for someone much shorter than this man.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: You think the Others sent someone out here to keep him company?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I think they sent someone out here because they lost communication.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Maybe when the sky turned purple.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: That would be my guess.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Well, if they sent somebody out here, they're hiding pretty good. I checked every nook and cranny of this place.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Not every nook and cranny, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: Are you ready to tell me the truth?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I have already told you the truth.  I do not know you.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: You tortured her.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: No, I would never touch a woman.  Do you think this will do any good? To make me confess to something I didn't do?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: My wife confessed to something she didn't do. She confessed when you poured a pan of boiling oil all over her arms!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: No I did not-
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: Admit it!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI: Admit it!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I can not admit to something I didn't do.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 AMIRA: That is enough for today.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAMI:  Then I will see you tomorrow.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 COMPUTER VOICE: Your move.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: What is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: C4. Explosive. The entire place is wired.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I don't know.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 DR. CANDLE: Manual override complete. For pallet drop enter 24. For station uplink enter 32. for mainland communication enter 38.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 DR. CANDLE: The satellite dish is inoperable. Communications are down. For sonar access enter 56.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 DR. CANDLE: Sonar is inoperable. Has there been an incursion of this station by the Hostiles? If so, enter 77.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Keep your voice low, and your hands in front of you.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Stop right there. Put the gun on the ground, now.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: What are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: It's her! She was there! She was at the dock! She was there when we got kidnapped! She knows where Jack is!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID:  Are there any more of you here?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Let's take her upstairs. John, we're coming up!  John!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Out here!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: This is simple. Send her over to me and I release him, and we all go our separate ways.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Don't listen to him. If he was going to kill me, I'd be dead already.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Shut your mouth!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Listen to me.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Sayid, do not let her go.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: I will execute you right here!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: He's not going to do it!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Be quiet, John!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm the only thing keeping him alive!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: I swear to you!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MS. KLUGH: Михаил. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Calm down everyone!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MS. KLUGH: Михаил! Ты знаешь что делать. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: У нас есть ещё выход. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Sayid!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I'll handle this, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: John...
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MS. KLUGH: Мы не можем рисковать. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: нет. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MS. KLUGH: Ты знаешь условия. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Есть другой выход. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MS. KLUGH: Они взяли нас. Мы не дадим им пройти на территорию.  
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Don't let her talk to him!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MS. KLUGH: Ты знаешь что делать. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Mikhail!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MS. KLUGH: Это приказ! 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: У нас всё ещё есть выход! 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Stop!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MS. KLUGH: Just do it, Mikhail!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Прости меня. 
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: John!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Finish it! Kill me.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: Sorry I beat you so bad, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Sorry you hustled me, you mean.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: My mom had a table in her basement. And I played a lot at the instit— this place I hung out at. And I got kinda good.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Well, hooray for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: Looks like that last slam didn’t cause any long-term damage to your forehead. And you got three points which is better than nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Is there something you want?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: I came to give you back your stuff.  Cause I know you're the kind of guy who needs stuff.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Are you a shrink now?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: She'll be ok, dude- Kate. I know you're worried about her. But she's with Locke and Sayid. She's going to be fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Well, thanks for the pep talk—
Lost.Season03.Episode11 HURLEY: Uh uh. It's Hurley. Or Hugo if you want.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAWYER: Get bent, Hugo.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 KATE: Ready to go, Locke?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Be there in a minute!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 DR. CANDLE: Has there be an incursion on this station by the Hostiles? If so, enter 77.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Danielle! Danielle! Tell me something. Were you ever a member of the DHARMA Initiative? Or was everything you said a lie? Of course, I'm wasting my breath.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: I was never a member. But everything else I told you was true. I moved into this station after the purge.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: The purge? In which a group of scientists attacked your people?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: Believe what you want, but that is what happened.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 ROUSSEAU: Your friends, did he kill them?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: No. They are collecting whatever is useful from the farmhouse. And now we have our ticket to where the Others live, where we will find your daughter, and Jack, and finally, perhaps, a way home.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: There is nothing you could do to me to make me lead you there.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I didn't say you were our ticket, did I?  This is a map showing electrical and data cabling running from the Flame, here, to a place called the Barracks, here. It's comprised of houses and dormitories, with water and power large enough to accommodate an entire community. Sounds like a place well worth visiting, don't you think?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 MIKHAIL: There will come a time when your guard is down. And when it is, I will not hesitate a moment before killing you. You should know this before you--
Lost.Season03.Episode11 ROUSSEAU: He is making an excellent point. You have a map. Why keep him alive?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 AMIRA: After my husband and I first arrived to Paris, I was afraid to ever leave our apartment. So I would stare out in the window into the alley, and I would see this cat looking for scraps. One day some children came into the alley and trapped him in a box. I watched them light firecrackers and drop them in the box. I could hear him howl from three stories above. So finally, I had a reason to leave my apartment. I rescued this cat and I brought him home. He sits with me when I read, sleeps with me, and he purrs. But, every once in a while, he will bite me or scratch me. He does this because sometimes he forgets that he is safe now. So I forgive him when he bites me, because I remember what it is like to never feel safe. And that is because of you. So today, I ask only one thing of you: I ask you now to show me the respect by acknowledging what you did to me. That it was you who questioned me, tortured me and that you remember me.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: I remember you. I remember your face. Your face has haunted me ever since I left Iraq.  I am sorry. I am so sorry for what I did to you. I am sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 AMIRA: I forgive you. When my husband returns, I will tell I made a terrible mistake, that it was not you, and he will release you.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Why? Why are you letting me go?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 AMIRA: We are all capable of doing what those children did to this cat. But I will not do that. I will not be that.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 ROUSSEAU: We should kill him, Sayid. He already told us he would kill us.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: No. He's my prisoner. I will decide his fate.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID:  I can see you didn't see anything worth taking.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: Actually I just played that silly chess game again. And now  I can see why you didn't want me to beat it.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: Meaning what?
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: What have you done, John? That place was our one hope of communication with the outside world!
Lost.Season03.Episode11 LOCKE: The computer said that if there was an incursion of the station by the Hostiles, I should enter 77. So I entered 77.
Lost.Season03.Episode11 SAYID: We should go. If anyone is around this explosion's going to attract their attention.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Mom! Mom! 
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: Oh look Aaron! Your mom has finally decided to wake up.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Mmm...
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: Only way I could get you to sleep in, was to borrow the midget.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: And, err, what is all this?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: An aperitif...of mysterious island fruit before the breakfast picnic I have set up in your honor a short walk down the beach.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: What's gotten into you Charlie?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: Sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: It's just, you've been so depressed all week, and now it's breakfast in bed and picnics...
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: I woke up this morning and I thought it's time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and seize the day, and I can't think of anyone I'd rather do some day-seizing with than you. So, what do you say? Let's drop the cherub off with Auntie Sun and Uncle Jin and you and I, go for a little stroll.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: I would love to.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: From the position of this stream, we should be here, and if the scale is right, his people are two miles in that direction.  I don’t expect you to confirm that.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: It's electrical wiring map, Sayid. I'm not sure it's as accurate as you think.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: Well it's certainly not as infallible as the magical carvings on your stick.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: Hey, the stick did get us to that station.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: Oh, the station which you accidentally blew up.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: Well, if you'da warned me that the basement was rigged with C4, I might'a been a little more careful.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE:  Why don't you just tell us if we're going the right way?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: You're going the right way.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: Remind me why we're keeping him alive.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: What do you suggest, we shoot him like a dog?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: No, I like dogs.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 ROUSSEAU: He's right; they will not trade his life for his friend's. We should shoot him.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: Enough, nobody's shooting anybody. The map says where they are, and he says the map is right. Just keep moving.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: Okay, here we are, here we are. Not bad eh?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Not bad at all...
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: Well, if you take a seat, we'll begin with our first course, which is cereal, we have fresh fruit salad—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: Good morning.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: Morning yourself. What brings you down to the beach, Desmond?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: Boar running thick. I was hoping you might want to join me in a hunt.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: Oh, well thanks for the invite, but as you can see we're just about to begin a picnic.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: I think hunting might be a better way to spend your day, Charlie. I mean of all the things you could choose to do today, hunting with me might be your best option.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Oh my god, oh, oh my god.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: What is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: I think I know how to get us off this island.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Sun, Jin!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SUN: Claire! What's the matter?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: I need Jin's nets and fish. We gotta hurry, and buckets, I'm gonna need those too.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 JIN: 뭐라고 하는 거야?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: We have to catch the birds.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SUN: What birds?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: They just flew over and they're only gonna be here today, so if we're gonna catch one, we need to do it now.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAWYER: Oh, this sounds like fun.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Can you get some nets?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAWYER: Nets for what, Barb—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAWYER: Nets for what, Claire?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Okay, five minutes ago, a flock of seabirds flew over my head. Seabirds are migratory, which means they're going to keep heading south.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SUN: I'm sorry; I don't understand why we need to—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: They're tagged!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 JIN: Tagged?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Scientists tag these birds so they can track them. So, when they eventually land in Australia or New Zealand or wherever, somebody's gonna gather them up.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SUN: We can send a message!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: If we can catch one. Okay, so here's the plan. First we gotta cut up these fish, make chum, that'll get the birds to settle in the water. And then, umm, we're gonna need to cut up some of this net. Charlie, can you go get some knives?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Umm, Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Charlie!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: Yeah, err, how do you even know this stuff about birds, Claire?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: I, umm, I watched a lot of nature shows with my mum.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: That doesn't exactly make you an expert. I just... I don't want to see you wasting your time, that's all.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: So what happened to seizing the day?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: Sorry, I don't see the point.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 E.R. DOCTOR: Hold still dear, just another second. There.  We're through now.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 OFFICER BARNES: Miss Littleton? I'm Officer Barnes. I'm sorry to bother you, but I need to ask you a few questions. Can I—ask you how the accident happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: A truck forced us off the road.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 BARNES: Okay... and who was driving?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE:  Me.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 BARNES: Has anyone contacted your father?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: My father died when I was two.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 BARNES: I'm sorry to hear that. I spoke with the truck driver — he's fine by the way — umm, he said that when you hit him—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: No, he hit us.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 BARNES: At about what speed would you say that happened when you were driving?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: It just came out of nowhere, I didn't—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 BARNES: That's not the question I asked, Miss Littleton.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: I don't, I don't know how fast I was driving.  Why are you even asking me these questions?!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 BARNES: These questions are standard procedure when there's a fatality.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: My mother is in surgery, she's not dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 BARNES: Right. So she is.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: This is not my fault.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 BARNES: Didn't say it was. Good day Miss Littleton.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: Can I ask you something? I told you that your daughter was living with them, and you haven’t asked me a single question about her, you haven't—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 ROUSSEAU: Your friend, Jack. Do you care about him?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 ROUSSEAU: Imagine 16 years from now, you're told he's still alive, but in your heart, you know that he wouldn't remember you. He wouldn’t know you. He wouldn't even know that you ever cared about him. I haven't asked you questions about my daughter because I do not want to know the answers.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE:  Water?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: No thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: So how'd you get here? How'd you get onto this island?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 ROUSSEAU: Don't waste your breath; whatever he says will be a lie.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: I was recruited when I was 24; I was approached by a man—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: I didn't ask you when, I asked you how.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: They brought me on the submarine.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: So your people, they can just come and go whenever they want?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: Oh yes, but two weeks ago, our underwater beacon stopped emitting its locator signal. There was an event, an electromagnetic pulse. It would be impossible to come back.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: Why would you want to come back?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: You would not understand.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE:  Try me.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: I misspoke. What I meant to say is you are not capable of understanding.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: And why am I not capable?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: Because you are not on the list.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: What list?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: The man who brought me here, who brought all of my people here, he is a magnificent man.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: If Ben's so magnificent, then why did he need one of us to save him?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: Ben? Ben is not. I will try to make this as simple as I can. You are not on the list because you are flawed. Because you are angry, and weak, and frightened.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: The more I learn about your people, the more I suspect you're not as omniscient as you'd have us believe. Don't speak to us as if you know us.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: Of course I don't know you, Sayid Jarrah. How could I? And you, Kate Austen, are a complete stranger to me. But you John Locke, you I might have a fleeting memory of, but I must be confused, because the John Locke I know was paral—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 ROUSSEAU: Hey! Look at this! Over here... come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: Well, looks like we're here.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Will this work?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 JIN: Yes, work.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 JIN: Err, Sun, needs help.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Okay.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Mmm... smells great!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SUN: Let's get it over with. This was my mother's worst fear.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: What do you mean?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SUN: That I would end up doing something very much like this, cutting bait. She had high hopes for my future. They did not include me marrying a fisherman's son.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Well, I guess we don't always turn out like our mother's wanted.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SUN: Of course, mine never worked a day in her life.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: My mom was a librarian.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SUN: Was?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: We should get this stuff out there.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LINDSEY: Where were you?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Went home to take a shower.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LINDSEY: Oh, that must have been nice.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: They said she was still in surgery. I had glass in my hair, Aunt Lindsey.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LINDSEY: Well I'm glad that you're feeling refreshed.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DR. WOODRUFF: Good afternoon. Are you the daughter? I'm Doctor Woodruff, neural surgery. I'll be observing your mother for the next few days.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LINDSEY: How is she?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 WOODRUFF: We’ve managed to stabilize her immediate injuries, but... your mother's suffered a severe head trauma. We'll have to wait for the swelling in her brain to go down before we determine the full extent of her injuries. But, uh, I'm afraid we're looking at fairly widespread damage.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Wait, what does that mean?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 WOODRUFF: It means that right now, these machines are sustaining her life.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: It won't always be, I mean when she wakes up she won't need—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 WOODRUFF: I can't say with any real confidence—that she will wake up.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Can she hear us?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 WOODRUFF: I'd like to think she can.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LINDSEY: How long will she be like this?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 WOODRUFF: Could be a day, a week, or years. We'll just have to wait and see. But I can assure you she'll be well looked after.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LINDSEY: Oh, that's very nice, but we can't pay for that.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 WOODRUFF: Don't worry; her expenses have already been taken care of.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LINDSEY: By whom?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 WOODRUFF: I've been asked to keep that confidential.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 JIN: One, two.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Oh no!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 JIN: 야...
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: Look, I'm sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 JIN: 이 멍청한 놈아!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: I'm sorry, man.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 JIN: 우리 다 죽을 뻔 했잖아!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: I said I'm sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: What the hell is wrong with you?!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: Look I was shooting at a boar, I had no idea you were out here.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Where's Charlie? Is he with you?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: He's back at the camp, look I'm really sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: So it's just you?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: Aye it's just me.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Hunting? In the exact same spot we're setting our trap!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: I was following a boar, Claire.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Oh, so it's just a coincidence then. Where is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: It got away.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: You don't want me to catch the birds do you? You and Charlie. What's going on?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: Why wouldn't I want you to catch the birds?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: What is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: Don't touch it! Don’t even go near it!  What are these pylons?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: What do you think they are?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: A security perimeter. Those sensors on the side would be triggered if anyone passed between them. It's an alarm system, or a trap. Either way, we'd be safer going around it.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: You're right, it was a security perimeter. But like everything else on this island, it hasn't functioned in years.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: Of course it hasn't.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: If you wish to waste your time, be my guest. The pylons encircle the entire Barracks. There is no going around them. If you don’t believe me, look at your map.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: He appears to be telling the truth.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: John, John!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 MIKHAIL: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: Oh my god.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: Sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: Looks like he suffered cerebral hemorrhage.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE:  Why did you do that? We needed him!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: They were never going to trade him for Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: You don't know that!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: Well you don't know it either! What we do know is that he shot one of his own people who didn't want to be in this exact situation. So I'm going to stick with my opinion.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: Yeah, well we could've discussed it.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: Nobody asked me about it when we brought him along in the first place.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: Alright.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: Pardon me, for not knowing that they had a— a sonic weapon fence. I didn't know he was gonna die, how would I know that?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: Why are you really here? Are you here for Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: Why else would I be here?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: We'll talk about this later.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: Fine by me. Just tell me how we're gonna go through this.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: We're not going through it, we're going over it. Sayid, where's the axe?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: It's in his pack.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: No wait a minute I got it— here I got it.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: I thought you didn't know there was any C4?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: Well I stand corrected.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: Why did you take it?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: You never know when a little C4 might come in handy.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: You'll have to do better than that.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Okay, here we go. Ohh...
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: What's going on with you Charlie?!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE:  Shh, I just put Aaron down.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: No, you and Desmond, what's going on?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: I don't know what you're talking about.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: So you don't know anything about Desmond shooting off his gun and scaring away the birds?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: I've been with Aaron, all morning.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: You're lying to me Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: I am not lying!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: What happened to the guy that woke up this morning and wanted to go and have a picnic and seize the day?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: You really wanna know the truth? The glint you saw could have been anything; a piece of glass stuck in the birds foot, or it coulda been nothing at all! I don't want to advocate false hope, Claire. That's all.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Well I'm sorry I bothered you with my stupid ideas. And err, it won't ever happen again. And Charlie, I don't want my baby around liars.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: I think you might be overreacting.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Overreacting?! No, I thought you were here for me, that I could count on you! I was wrong!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: Claire...
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE:  No, I'm on my own and at least I know that now.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: Claire...
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE:  Just go!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 HEAD NURSE: Morning dear. Oh, I like your new doctor.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: What new doctor?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 HEAD NURSE: Oh, the American. He's in with your mum now.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOUDSPEAKER: Dr. Brown to the OR stat, Dr. Brown to the OR stat.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: 'scuse me.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: The nurse said that—are you a doctor?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: Yes, umm. I'm umm. I'm very sorry, I shouldn't be disturbing you, I was just leaving.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LINDSEY: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: I was just on my way out, Lindsey.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LINDSEY: If Carole knew you were here—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: She'd what? What would she do? She wouldn't be acting the way you are.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Aunt Lindsey, err, what's going on here? Who is he?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LINDSEY: It doesn't matter, just go.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: Maybe you should tell her, Lindsey? She deserves to know.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LINDSEY: Please, just leave us alone.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN:  You are not the arbiter here.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LINDSEY:  No, you are taking advantage of my—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN:  Under these circumstances, I do believe that Claire has every right to know!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE:  Just stop it! You are the one paying the bills? Are you the one taking care of all this?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Then who are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: I'm your father, Claire.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: The system appears to fire a sonic pulse when an object breaks the plane between two pylons. So, as long as we don't break the plane, we should remain unharmed.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 ROUSSEAU: Why don't we just use the plastic explosive you took?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: Be my guest, you wanna go stick it on there?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: Whoever climbs over, give those sensors a wide berth.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: I'll go first.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 LOCKE: I guess I'll go next.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SUN: Here you go.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SUN: You have every right to be upset.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: It just doesn't make any sense. Desmond's never gone boar hunting before, and the boar never come that close to the beach.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SUN: Well whatever's going on, they're still talking about it.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Can you watch him? 
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SUN: What are you going to do?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Get some answers.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: I'll be with you in a sec!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: There you go, that'll be ten bucks.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: Buy you a cup of coffee?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: I have nothing to say to you.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: Claire, I'm leaving tonight, then I'll be out of your life forever. Just one cup of coffee.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: So it's true?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: Yes, it's true.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: How'd you find out about the accident?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: A doctor friend here in Sydney told me. I got the call the minute your mother went into surgery.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Why did she tell me that you were dead?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: Well, because I, no doubt, left her with so many wonderful memories. Look, we had a fling, I was back in Los Angeles, and she told me she was pregnant, that she was going to have the baby, have you.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: And you didn't want to see me?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: No, no, I came out a bunch of times when you were little. I stayed over, I gave you toys, I sang to you.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Why'd you stop coming?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: Cause your aunt hates me and your mother didn't like the fact that I had another family.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Why are you here now then? And why'd you come? You could've just paid the bills from the States.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: I came over because I wanted to help.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Help with what?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: Claire, your mother is alive, but she's not really living.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: It means that now may be the time to look at other alternatives; other ways to relieve her pain. Now, it is illegal to turn off her machines, but I know of ways that can achieve the same effect without the legal consequences.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Just stop it! You didn't come here to help me, you came here to try and fix a mistake that you made.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: No honey, that's not true.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: You think that just paying her bills makes you noble or something? You come down here and you try and get me to kill her? You know, just go. Why don't you just go, go back to your real family.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: You know... You know, you might be my father, but I don't even know your name, and I umm, want it to stay that way.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHRISTIAN: Claire! Claire, Claire listen to me. Do not keep your mother alive for the wrong reasons. Now there is hope and there is guilt. And believe me, I know the difference.  Bye kiddo, it was great seeing you again.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: What the hell are you doing?!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: You followed me. Stay back!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: It's one of the birds.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: Stay back!
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: It's a—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: How did you know it was gonna be here?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: I didn't.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Yes you did, you had to. That's what you and Charlie were arguing about. You knew.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: How would I?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: I don't know, but you know, you walked straight here, no doubt at all about where you were going. You came right to this beach and right to this rock, and lo and behold, there's the bird. What the hell is going on Desmond?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: See that spot over there?  That's where Charlie slipped and fell. He got pounded again and again by the rocks and broke his neck.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: What? What are you talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 DESMOND: That's where Charlie died.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Look what Desmond found.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: How 'bout that? It does have a tag. You were right.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Desmond told me everything. About all his visions; that he knew you were gonna get hit by lightning; that you were gonna drown, trying to rescue me in the ocean; how you died trying to get me this bird.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: You don't believe all that, do you?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 , walks into her mother's hospital room.]
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: Now who turned the telly off? Don't they know how much you love your nature shows?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: That's better. So how are you today Mom? Did you have an okay night? There's umm, something I have to tell you, Mom, something I should have told you a long time ago.  I'm pregnant. I err, I'm giving it away, it's for the best. I wish—I don't know how you did it... raising me alone? It must have been so hard. And I was just awful, awful... so horrible to you.  I'm so sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for all the awful things I said to you in the car; that I hated you; and that I wished you weren't my mother; and I wished you were dead. It's all my fault, the accident and everything. I'm so sorry, mom. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll see you soon, okay?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE : To whom it may concern, we are survivors of Oceanic Flight 815. We have survived on this island for 80 days. We were 6 hours into the flight when the pilot said we were off course and turned back towards Fiji. We hit turbulence and crashed. We've been waiting here, all this time, waiting for rescue that has not come. We do not know where we are; we only know you have not found us. We've done our best to live on this island. Some of us have come to accept that we may never leave it. Not all of us have survived since the crash, but there is new life too, and with it, there is hope. We are alive. Please don't give up on us.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CHARLIE: It's—it's perfect, Claire.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 CLAIRE: You know, I'm not giving up on you either, Charlie. It's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. We'll get through this together.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode12 SAYID: We're here.
Lost.Season03.Episode12 KATE: Jack—
Lost.Season03.Episode12 TOM: Ha! Whoop!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 GOVERNMENT WORKER: Name?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: John Locke.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 GOVERNMENT WORKER: Marital status, Mr. Locke?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Uh, single.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 GOVERNMENT WORKER: Girlfriend?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 GOVERNMENT WORKER: Are your parents living?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: I, I was raised in foster care. I never really knew my parents.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 GOVERNMENT WORKER: Have you ever considered seeking out your biological parents?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  Ah, I, ah.. I don't see how that's relevant.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 GOVERNMENT WORKER: It's relevant, Mr. Locke, because if the government's going to continue paying your disability insurance, I have to figure out whether or not your condition has improved. So. How's your appetite?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 GOVERNMENT WORKER: I see you've stopped submitting your therapy bills for reimbursement.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: That's 'cause I stopped going. Waste of time.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 GOVERNMENT WORKER: It's just a temporary suspension, Mr. Locke. As soon as you resume your sessions, you can reapply.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: You think I'm temporarily disabled?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 GOVERNMENT WORKER: Depression can be temporary, yes. And since you see fit to stop going to therapy, I guess you're all better.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  Guess I am.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 GOVERNMENT WORKER: Next!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 TOM:  Over here!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  What is he doing...?!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Shhh!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 TOM:  Good hands!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JULIET: Jack!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  She's the one who helped me and Sawyer escape.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: What's up?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JULIET: Okay, I think it's going to be tomorrow.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  Hey, what?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 SAYID:  Danielle.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  John, Rousseau's gone.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: Can you feel anything?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: So how do you feel? 
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: This is going to be more complicated than we thought.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 SAYID: So what exactly are you saying? We simply start shooting people and hope for the best?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: We came here to rescue Jack, and that's what we're going to do.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 SAYID: But obviously the circumstances have changed. He may not want to be rescued.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: That is not him! That's not Jack. They must have done something to him. When they captured us, they drugged us.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 SAYID: He didn't appear to be drugged, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: They kidnapped him! Held him prisoner! He wouldn't just forget that!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 SAYID: I agree. But until we know why, we're putting our lives at risk.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  I'm not leaving him, Sayid.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 SAYID:  You may not have a choice.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: It's Jack. The first time I saw him he was risking his life pulling people out of burning airplane wreckage. If he's shaking hands with the Others, I'm sure he has a good reason. We just have to go down there and find out what it is.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 SAYID: What do you suggest?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: We wait till it's dark, we approach Jack when he's alone... and if he wants out, we get him out.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 AUTUMN: Here's what we know, Crystal: The Bolivian gold deposits were stolen last night around 2 a.m.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 CRYSTAL: Um, that means...?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 AUTUMN: The Cobra!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 CRYSTAL: He's back! Ah, get down!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 AUTUMN: I've been shot!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 CRYSTAL: I can't find him!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 AUTUMN: There! Behind winged victory! I think he's armed!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 CRYSTAL: I can get him!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PETER: Hello. John Locke?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: I'm sorry. No solicitors.  I have a sign.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PETER: Uh, I'm not... I'm not trying to sell you any... Listen, my name's Peter Talbot. I, uh, I just need a couple of minutes to talk to you.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Talk about what?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PETER: My mother, actually. I think she might be in some trouble.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: You've got the wrong John Locke. 
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PETER: How many kidneys do you have?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PETER: She met him two months ago. Love at first sight, is what she said. Guy was charming, sweet, funny. His name's Adam Seward. He's a retired computer entrepreneur from Ontario.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PETER: Anyway, Adam had something... special. My mom just went ga-ga for him right out of the gate. After two months of knowing him, she agrees to marry the guy. And something about him, it... Something in my gut told me that he was after something, so I... I had to check him out.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Well, I'm not sure what any of this has to do with me.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PETER: Well, what this has to do with you, Mr. Locke, is that you donated one of your kidneys to Adam Seward. Only his name was different back then. He used to be Anthony Cooper.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PETER: All I could find were his medical records. And I saw that he was the recipient of a kidney transplant from... you... so I figured, hey, someone gave the guy his kidney; how bad could he be? Right?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Well, it, it was an anonymous donation. I never met him.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PETER: Are you sure?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't help you.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  Sayid, you guard the front. I'll go around and cover the back.  You head in through the side door.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: I'm going in alone?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: It's better if you're the first one he sees.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: All right.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: Hi.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: I came to get you.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK:  Get out of here! Right now. Go. 
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: Jack...
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK:  Kate! They're watching me!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: Get out of here!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: I'm not leaving you!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: Yes you are!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 OTHER: Get down! Get down!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PRYCE: Get her down! Get her down!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PRYCE:  Step back, Doc. Step. Back.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PRYCE: Hold him still!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: Jack! Jack?! Jack!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PRYCE:  Who else is with you?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  Jack...
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: Just answer the question, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PRYCE: OK, one more time.  Who else is with you?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  Nobody. Nobody else; it was just us. 
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Alex?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: John!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  Shhh. Keep your voice down.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: All right. It's all right, John. You don't have to point the gun at me. I can tell you where Jack is.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  I'm not looking for Jack. I'm looking for the submarine.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: The submarine. Where is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: I'm not sure what you mean, John. What submarine?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: The one you use to travel to and from the island. The one your man Mikhail told me about, right before I killed him.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALEX:  Dad? Who are you talking to?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN:  Alex, don't come in here!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALEX:  What do you--?! What--?! Ah! Dad--?!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  Tell her to be quiet!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Alex, please!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 TOM:  Ben? You awake?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 TOM:  I'm coming in!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: What is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 TOM: It's Austen and Jarrah. They're here. Somehow they found us.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Where are they now?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 TOM: We captured them. We're holding them over at my place. Want me to help you get out there?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: No. Separate them. I want to know how they found us.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 TOM: What about Juliet and Shephard? Tomorrow, in the morn—
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Let me worry about that. Just go.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 TOM: Got it.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Richard? Wait a minute.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 TOM: I'll wait outside.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: I want you to bring me the man from Tallahassee.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALPERT: What do you need him for?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Just do it. Now.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALPERT: OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  The man from Tallahassee? What is that? Some kind of code?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: No, John, unfortunately we don't have a code for "There's a man in my closet with a gun to my daughter's head." Although we obviously should.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  Sayid — he had a pack with him.  I want her to retrieve it.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: ...OK. But you should know, John, my daughter currently hates me. So I'm not sure holding me hostage is your best option—
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALEX: Dad!  I'll get your bag.
Lost.Season03.Episode13  are looking at flowers for their upcoming wedding.]
Lost.Season03.Episode13 MRS. TALBOT: I'm looking for something really stunning, something that will grab everyone's attention on the table. Honey? What do you think of this one?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: That looks good. What do you think?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 MRS. TALBOT: I like it. Maybe just a little larger.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: Yeah.  Larger would be good. Um, I'll go over there and take a look.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: Hello, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Going to be a big to-do, or just the two of you and a preacher? I guess you couldn't invite me, huh? That would make for... awkward introductions.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: How did you even know that I was going to--?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: I know... because her son came to me and asked why I gave you a kidney. He's on to you. But he doesn't have any proof, so he came to me, hoping I would vouch for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: What did you say to him?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: You're conning her, aren't you? You're going to marry her for her money, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: What is it you want, John?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: I want you to end it. I want you to call off the wedding.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: Why are you doing this?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Because. Because it's not fair! You make people think that you're their family. And then you leave their life in ruins. And I'm not going to let you do it again! You're going to call off your engagement and go... or I'm going to tell her the truth. I want to hear you say it! You say you're going to leave!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: OK, John. You got it. 
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Would you mind helping me get into my chair? No tricks, I promise.  I just want some dignity. You of all people should understand what it means to want some dignity.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Thank you. So tell me, John. How do you expect to pilot our submarine? I mean, it's a complicated piece of machinery. You don't just press "submerge".
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: I'll figure something out. For all you know I was a commander in the navy.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Put your arm around my neck. I'll lift under your knees.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: What's in the pack, John? If you met Mikhail that means you were in the communications station. Which means you found the explosives. So you're not planning to pilot the submarine anywhere, are you? You're planning to destroy it. I know you, John Locke.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: You don't know me at all.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: I know you were born in California. I know you were raised in foster care. I know you wasted a big part of your life in Tustin, pushing papers at a company that manufactured industrial boxes. I know you spent the four years prior to your arrival on this island in a wheelchair. And I know how you ended up in it. Tell me, John. Did it hurt?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: I felt my back break. What do you think?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 TOM: I didn't think I'd see you again so soon, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 TOM:  Be careful in here.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK:  Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: They hurt you?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: No. They hurt you?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK:  No.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  What is all this?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: This is where they live.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: And the people they took? The kids?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: They're all safe.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  Safe?  So you're with them now.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK:  I'm not "with" anyone, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: What did they do to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: Nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  Then why are you acting like this?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: There's no w- You- There's no way that I could-
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  I came here to help you! So why don't you just tell me why you're...
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK:  I told you not to come back here for me!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  I didn't think you meant it.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: What did they do to you, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: I made a deal with them. They're going to let me go.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: Where?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: Home.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  When?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: First thing in the morning.  I can bring back help. It's our best chance--
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE:  You trust these people?  They are liars! Why would you believe a word that...
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK:  I trust them because you told me to, Kate. When you asked me to save Sawyer's life.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KATE: Jack... What did they tell you?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JULIET: Jack, we need to go.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: I'll be right there.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: I asked that you not come back here for me and I wish... I wish that you hadn't.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: But I will come back here for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 DETECTIVE MASON: John Locke?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Yeah...?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 DETECTIVE MASON: Detective Mason. That's Detective Reed. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: No, of course not.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 DETECTIVE MASON: Do you know a man named Peter Talbot?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  No, I don't think so.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 DETECTIVE MASON: Thin, brown hair, 20s?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 DETECTIVE MASON: If it will be helpful, we believe he was here in your apartment two days ago.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Oh! Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, he was a solicitor. I, I, uh, I, I sent him away.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 DETECTIVE MASON: Mr. Talbot's family is worth somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 million dollars. So I'm curious, what exactly was he selling you door-to-door?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Well, I... Look, I told you I don't know him, so...
Lost.Season03.Episode13 DETECTIVE MASON: Then why was your name and address on a piece of paper in his pocket, Mr. Locke?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  Why were y... would you be looking through his pockets?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 DETECTIVE MASON: Because Peter Talbot's dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: It wasn't easy, you know. Being in that hatch with you all that time. Knowing you had no business walking around. Knowing I couldn't even ask you about it without telling you who I really was.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: So ask me now.  Now that I know who you really are.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN:  Was it immediate? It started the moment you got here?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: And you were just walking? The feeling returned right after the crash? That day?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: That's what immediate means, Ben. You're wondering why it hasn't happened for you. You're not recovering as fast as you'd like. How long has it been since Jack fixed you? A week? Now that I think about it, how'd you get sick in the first place?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Are you afraid it'll go away, John? Is that why you want to destroy the submarine? Because you know if you ever leave this island you'll be back in the chair?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  You got anything to eat?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PRYCE: Hey. Go on home, kid. You know you're not supposed to be here.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALEX: My father sent me to get his pack.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PRYCE: ... Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALEX:  I don't know, Ryan, but he told me to get it.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PRYCE: All right. Here you go.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 SAYID: You're Alex, aren't you?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PRYCE: Hey! Can it.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALEX: How do you know my name?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 SAYID: Because you look like your mother.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALEX:  My mother is dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 SAYID: I'm sure that's what they told you.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PRYCE: Get going, Alex.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PRYCE:  Keep your mouth shut.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Where do you get electricity?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: We have two giant hamsters running in a massive wheel at our secret underground lair...
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Yeah, that's funny.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: There's leftovers in the refrigerator. Help yourself.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: I ate most of the dark meat. Sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  Mmm. I never really appreciated chicken until right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN:  I know you think you need to do this, John, but if you blow up my submarine, I have a big problem with my people.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Is that supposed to be an incentive not to blow it up?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN:  I was born on this island. Not many of my people can say that. Most of them were recruited and brought here and as much as they love this place, as much as they would do anything to defend it, they need to know they can leave if they want to. The sub maintains that illusion.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: So you're lying to them?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN:  No! They're here because they want to be here! Some of them are just not ready to make a full... commitment yet. But you, John ... You've already made that commitment.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: And now you have a choice. Because if you stop and if you think, I can show you things. Things I know you want to see very badly. Let me put it so you'll understand. Picture a box. You know something about boxes, don't you, John? What if I told you that somewhere on this island, there's a very large box ... and whatever you imagined, whatever you wanted to be in it, when you opened that box, there it would be. What would you say about that, John?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: I'd say I hope that box is big enough to imagine yourself up a new submarine. 
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN:  Why are you so angry, John?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Because you're cheating! You and your people.  Communicate with the outside world whenever you want to, you... you come and go as you please... you use electricity and running water and guns... You're a hypocrite! A pharisee. You don't deserve to be on this island. If you had any idea what this place really was... you wouldn't be putting chicken in your refrigerator!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: You've been here 80 days, John. I've been here my entire life! So how is it that you think you know this island better than I do?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Because you're in the wheelchair, and I'm not.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Did you have any problems?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: OK, here's how this is going to work. She's going to take me to the sub. Once we're there, I'll let her go.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: John, she's done enough. Let me take you.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: I don't want you to slow me down.  Come on. Let's go.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN:  John, before you go you should know—!  Jack and I made a deal. In less than an hour he's leaving this island on that submarine, and it's a one-way ticket. The anomaly wiped out our communications. We have no way of contacting the outside world. Which means when that sub leaves, it can never come back. So whether you destroy the submarine or whether you let it go, the end result is the same. No one will find this island.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  Let's go.  Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALEX: You know he's manipulating you, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: How's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALEX: That's what my father does. He manipulates people. He makes you think it's your idea, but it's his.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: I'll have to keep that in mind.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALEX: The submarine is down there. At the end of the dock.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: Look, I know you don't owe me anything, but I need to ask you for one last favor.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: You don't knock?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: I need you to let my friends go. After I'm gone.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: And if I said no, would that stop you from leaving?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK:  Of course it would.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Your friends are only here to rescue you, but you seem to be doing a good job of rescuing yourself, so... I suppose there's no reason to keep them here.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: Do I have your word on that?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN:  You have my word.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: I'll let them go, just as soon as you've left the island.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN:  Well, I guess this is it.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JULIET: Thank you, Ben, for keeping your promise.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 PRYCE: Hey! Hold it right there. Get your hands up! Get down! I said get down!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: What are you doing here, John?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: I'm sorry, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 JACK: Sorry for what?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: What did you do?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: John!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Tell me. Tell me you didn't do it!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER:  What are you talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  Tell me that you didn't kill that kid!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: What? You think I had something to do with Peter's death?!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: I tell you to end things with his mother, and the next thing you know, he's dead!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: John, now calm down, please. Think about what you're saying. Why would I kill Peter?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  He was on to you!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: John, I've been doing this for a long time. I'm not sweating some rich kid.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Then why are you still here?!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: What do you mean?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  I tell you to leave, you tell me you're going to leave town!  Why are you still here?!
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: Now listen, John. I'll be honest with you. I didn't end it. I was looking for an angle. I wanted to make some money before I skipped out. But then all this happened.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: Peter died and everything just went straight into the tank. She's devastated. She's called off the wedding. There's no profit in it, John. I'm a con man, not a murderer. 
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  She called off the wedding?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER: She said she couldn't deal with it. She needs to be alone.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE:  So if I were to call her, right now, that's what she would tell me?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 COOPER:  Phone's right over there, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: What's her number—
Lost.Season03.Episode13 DETECTIVE MASON: Mr. Locke, we know this isn't what you want to hear, but your father's gone. We know he fled to Mexico shortly after your... encounter, then... he disappeared. I'm sorry, but he could be anywhere in the world right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KINCAID: All right detectives, that's enough. Mr. Locke has work to do today.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 DETECTIVE MASON: We'll let you know if anything develops.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KINCAID: John, John, John. We have got ourselves quite a day ahead of us, my friend. It's a fine time to get you up out of that bed.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: No. I don't want to.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KINCAID: I don't remember asking.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KINCAID: Now. Most people struggle with this at first, but don't worry, you'll get used to it.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Uh, no, no, please, I, I, I can't do this—
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KINCAID: John. You fell eight stories and survived, OK? I don't want to hear about what you can't do. Now let's go. It's going to be all right.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: No, I don't, no, I don't think...
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KINCAID:  It's going to be fine, John. Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: I don't think I... think I can...
Lost.Season03.Episode13 KINCAID: You're fine. Ah... there you go. There you go, buddy. See? Wasn't that bad, was it?  I'll be right back, buddy.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Well, John, you've really gone and done it now.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: You don't have to pretend to be disappointed anymore. We both know you wanted it to happen. That's why you left the C-4 in Sayid's bag: because you wanted me to make it happen.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Uncuff him please, Richard.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 ALPERT: You going to do anything stupid?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: No, sir.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Do you remember earlier, John, when you called me a cheater? When you said I didn't deserve to live on this island? Well get this: There I was, shaking hands with Jack, and thinking I'd give almost anything to come up with a way to stop him from leaving... because to let him go would be a sign of weakness, of failure, of defeat. People would see that. They would know it. And that, John, would be the end of me. But to kill him... that would be cheating. Because my people also heard me make a promise, and to break my word... that would be the end of me too. And then you came striding out of the jungle, John, to make my dream come true.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: You're not going to start talking about the magic box again, are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: No, John. I'm going to show you what came out of it.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: When I asked you earlier if it hurt when you suffered your injury, I think you misunderstood me. Seems fairly obvious that when a person's back smashes into a hard surface after being thrown from a building, that that's going to sting a little. But I really wasn't asking about the physical pain.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: What, do you want to know if it hurt my feelings?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: No, John. I wanted to know what it felt like when your own father tried to kill you.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: He's the reason you destroyed the submarine, isn't he? You're afraid. You're afraid of him, and this is the one place he can never find you. This is the one place he can never get to.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: What do you want from me?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: I don't know how it happened, but you seem to have some communion with this island, John, and that makes you very, very important. You have no idea what you're talking about, of course, but in time you'll have a better understanding of things. So what do I want? I want to help you, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 BEN: Because I'm in a wheelchair and you're not. Are you ready to see?
Lost.Season03.Episode13 LOCKE: Dad?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ANNOUNCER: And now, dancing on stage three, the pride of Saint Paul, Corvette!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: No! That's the money for the orphanage. That means, Mr. LaShade, you're the Cobra.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BILLY DEE: Sorry, baby, it's just business.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: All this time it was you.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BILLY DEE: Pretty and smart. What a shame.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Razzle-dazzle! Ha!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BILLY DEE: Autumn, Crystal, bad news. Corvette was working for the Cobra. But fear not: he will pay.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ZUKERMAN: And, cut!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BILLY DEE: Oh, let me give you a hand. 
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Oh, thank you. Billy Dee, it was so great working with you.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BILLY DEE: Oh, no, the pleasure's all mine; thank you so much.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: You're sweet.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BILLY DEE: Take care.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: You too.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ZUKERMAN: Alright, that's a series wrap for Corvette! Let's hear it for Nikki!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ZUKERMAN: Brilliant, Nikki. As always. You know, you don't need to die. We can bring you back next season.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI:  How?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ZUKERMAN: Well, let's say that, uh, Corvette was wearing a bullet-proof vest?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ZUKERMAN: Bullet-proof breast!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI:  Look, I'm just a guest star, and we all know what happens to guest stars.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ZUKERMAN: Now that your work's done here, I suppose you'll be leaving Sydney and heading back to LA.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: No, I'm not leaving Sydney. I love you.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ZUKERMAN: I love you too.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Son of a bitch! Alright, come on, let's go one more.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: You said best out of five.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Well, now we're going best of seven.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Ah.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Uh, you OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI:  Pa... lies...
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: The hell's she saying?!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: I dunno.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Let's get her some water! Get help!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: What are you doing?! Get moving!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Dude... Nikki's dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: ... Who the hell's Nikki?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Mmm. Howie, the frittata is amazing.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ZUKERMAN: Hm hm! My new chef; he's fantastic. Paulo, come in here.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO:  Yes, sir?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ZUKERMAN: Paulo, my boy, you have a new fan. I'd like you to meet Nikki.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: The food is amazing.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: You're too kind. The secret is the shaved truffles. Luckily for you, they are in season.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI:  You know, you should ask for a raise.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Excuse me. 
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ZUKERMAN: He just came to Sydney. Heard I was hiring, and showed up at my office every day until I gave him the job. Apparently, back home, he's the, um, "Wolfgang Puck of Brazil".
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Wow.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ZUKERMAN:  Here. Try one of these home-made rolls.  Please, please do.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Oh, it's... beautiful. Howie, you shouldn't have!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ZUKERMAN:  I realize, of course, it's not a ring. Not yet. But, uh, when my wife--
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI:  Paulo..! Paulo!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: He's gone.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI:  I would have loved it if you could have figured out a way where I didn't have to eat the same food as him.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: So nobody else knows about this thing?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Everything in here is way off the books.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Ashes are evidence, Paulo. We poisoned him; let's not poison ourselves.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Razzle-frickin'-dazzle.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: We dunno. She's got no gunshot wound, no knife wound, no polar bear bite, nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SUN: Maybe it was something she ate.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: Maybe she was poisoned.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SUN: We should check the food supply to see if anyone else is sick.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE:  She's got gunk. Under her fingernails.  Where'd you find her?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Right here. She stumbled out of the jungle, face-planted, said something like "plywood", and... and, sayonara.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Actually, I think she said "power lines."
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Well, who the hell knows what she said — she was five seconds from dying. Probably seeing a light at the end of the tunnel—
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY:  "Paulo lies!" That's what she said! "Paulo lies," not "power lines." "Paulo lies."
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Who the hell's Paulo?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Paulo's her... husband, or... boyfriend, or... whatever. They lived down the beach.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Well, where the hell is he? 'Cause if he lies, that might be a good place to start.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: English ex-pat, Howard L. Zuckerman, the creative force behind such hit shows as Exposé, Strike Team Alpha and Dr. Kincaid Esquire, was found dead in his palatial Sydney estate from heart failure.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Are you chewing gum?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Nicotine gum. I quit.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: A toast. To our new life together.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Cheers.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SHANNON: There's nowhere to sit. No tables, no chairs, nothing. Good call, Boone.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BOONE: Do you wanna just grab a chair from the restaurant?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SHANNON: No, forget it, let's just leave. You already screwed us out of seats in first class, why would you be able to find them here?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BOONE:  Hey, can I have this chair please?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Yeah. Be my guest.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SHANNON: Boone, let's just go!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BOONE: Thanks anyway.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SHANNON: Boone!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BOONE: I'm coming, Shannon.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SHANNON: If you quit flirting with random guys, maybe you could actually get on the plane.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Promise me we'll never end up like them.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: I promise.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 AIRPORT PA: Paging Captain Stewart, please pick up the courtesy call Captain Stewart.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SHANNON: BOONE!!! BOONE!!! BOONE!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 LOCKE: Hey, hey, get away from there!  Hey, get back, get down. Get away from there!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Paulo! Paulo!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ARZT: Are we alive? Did we survive? Look at me, am I OK? Am I OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BOONE:  Hey. Do you have a pen? Do you have a pen?  Hey does anybody have a pen?!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Paulo. Paulo, are you OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Yeah. I think so.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Baby look at me. Look at me.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Where's the bag?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: The bag, Paulo, where is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: I'm telling ya, this is the trail.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: What do you know about tracking?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Well I know what a footprint is.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 JIN: Over here.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Wow.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: I'm guessing that's Paulo.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: He's just like Nikki, no wound, nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 JIN: 이 친구 옷이 왜 이래?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Yeah I know.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Why are his pants undone? And why's his shoe in that tree?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Maybe he stepped on something.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: You see something? Sawyer?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: No! Don't.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Dude, what are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Two people are dead — you ever think they mighta been poisoned?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: That's evidence. You're messing up the crime scene.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Crime scene? There a forensics hatch I don't know about?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 JIN: STOP! Monster.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: How many times do I have to tell you, there's no such thing as monsters.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Maybe it was a dinosaur.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Its not Jurassic Park, Paulo, its the South Pacific.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Then what was it? You saw the trees move.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Would you start focusing? We've been here for six days, OK, the coastguard is gonna get here any second, and I really don't think that they're gonna take "hey, you know what, I'm looking for my script bag" as an excuse for not getting on the rescue boat.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: OK, OK, OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ETHAN: Hey. You guys lose your luggage? Yeah I lost mine too. I found some other stuff though, so if you need anything, pants or sweatshirt, I can help you find some that fit. I'm Ethan, by the way.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Hi, I'm Nikki, and this is Paulo.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ETHAN: Nikki.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Hi.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ETHAN: Paulo.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: And you are so sweet Ethan, but actually we're not looking for clothes. Yeah, see, Paulo here lost his nicotine gum.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ETHAN: Ouch. You might have more luck looking inland.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: In the jungle?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ETHAN: The plane split apart when it was over the Island , so some of the stuff might have rained down in there.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ARZT: Boone. Boone took the water.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 KATE: What is going on?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BOONE: Someone had to take responsibility for it, it would have never lasted!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 JACK: Leave him alone! Its been six days, we're all still waiting for someone to come. We have to stop waiting. We need to start figuring things out. Now I found water. Fresh water up in the valley. I'll take in a group at first light. If you don't wanna come, then find another way to contribute. Because every man for himself is not gonna work. But if we can't live together, we're gonna die alone.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: I'm with Jin. It's the Monster.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Yeah, because that makes the most sense.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: It does. Locke said when Eko died, his last words were "You're next." And Nikki and Paulo were with them. He was talking about them.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: He wasn't saying you're next about them, he was saying you're next as in you're all next.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Yeah, that's not really better.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Alright, so here's how I see it. We wanna know what happened, we gotta find out whatever we can about these jabronis.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 JIN: Jabronis?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Nina and Pablo.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Dude, show some respect. You know their names, its Nikki and Paulo.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Whatever, Hugo. Where's their tent? And we better get some shovels.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Hey Dr. Arzt.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ARZT: Oh hi.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: You're a scientist, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ARZT: And an educator, yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: What are you doing with all this stuff?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ARZT: Oh, erm well, since we've been on here, I've discovered 20 new species. I'm gonna be the next Charles Darwin.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ARZT: Ah, ah, that is a Latrodectus regina. Very dangerous. They call her the medusa spider. Her pheromones are very strong, one whiff and every male of the species would be here in seconds. Not unlike you I guess.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: So, you're probably too busy to help me then.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ARZT: No, no, not at all, I'm fine, er, I can help you, what can I do ya for?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Well I'm trying to find my luggage, and since the plane broke apart over the jungle, I was wondering if you knew about trajectories and stuff.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ARZT:  Do I, do I know about trajectories? Allow me to draw you a map, madam.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Are you sure we should be listening to a high school science teacher?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Junior high, and yes. What's your problem with Leslie anyway?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Leslie?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Oh ho, you're jealous!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Of him? Ha, never.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Yeah, his spiders turn me on so much, I had to sleep with him to get the map.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: I wouldn't be surprised. You slept with Zuckerman.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: I did that for us.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: OK I'm sorry, I just, I don't trust that guy. We should have gone to Ethan, he would have helped.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Paulo, look.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Another plane. Looks like its been here a while.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Go up there, maybe there's a radio or some—
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Are you insane? If I go up there that thing's gonna fall.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: You're not gonna fall.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: What? You want me to die?  Come on. Let's keep going.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: What's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: OK, let's do it.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Let's check it out.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Wow. So our carry-on bag fell from the sky, opened a manhole, crawled inside and closed the doors behind itself? You don't wanna climb up to a plane, but now you wanna climb down a ladder into a dark tunnel. I don't think so.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Hey, man, be careful.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Why? They don't live here any more.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: So Sun checked the food. They were eating the same as us and no one else is sick. Could it be a virus?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Dude, Monster.  Creepy, they collected bugs.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: Ah, I think these were Arzt's. Collected all kinds of creepy crawlies before he... exploded.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: They must have been friends.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: Exposé.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Did you just say Exposé?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: What the hell's Exposé?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Only the most awesome hour of television ever. It's like "Baywatch", only better. Its about Autumn and Crystal, two strippers that solve crimes with the help of their suave smooth-talking club owner, Mr. LaShade.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: How'd I miss that one?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Check it out, look at the cast list, Nikki Fernandez. That's gotta be why she was in Australia. This must have been her big break.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: Well it certainly sounds like it.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: No way. Mr. LaShade was the Cobra?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: Is that supposed to mean something?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Dude the Cobra's this big bad guy. His identity's been shrouded in mystery for four seasons.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: They had a walkie talkie?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Every damn one of those bastards on the other side of the Island had one exactly like this hanging from their belts.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: So how did Nikki and Paulo get one?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: I'll tell ya how. They were working with the Others.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SHANNON: What gives you the right?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 KATE: You have to understand, we thought it was best for everybody.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ARZT: I'm sorry, you my mother? Cause she knows what's best for me — other than that, I decide.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Hey, what's going on?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SHANNON: Kate and her two boyfriends found a case of guns that fell out of the plane, but they decided they didn't really need to tell the camp.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 KATE: Look. The case is locked. The key is around Jack's neck, alright. I promise you they're safe.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 ARZT: You're all out of control. The pigs are walking.  Huh, the pigs are walking!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI:  So, where did you say you found that case?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Its just water, Paulo. Stop being such a wuss and dive in.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Why me?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Well as you had no trouble reminding me, I slept with Howie Zuckerman. So the least you could do is go for a swim, and Kate said they found the case on the bottom.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Lemme ask you something.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: If you didn't need me to find that bag, would we still be together?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: That bag is worth eight million dollars. Just dive in, Paulo.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Well?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: There's nothing down there?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Just dead bodies.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: OK, so they had a walkie talkie. You think they were working with the Others, like how?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Like Michael.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: If that's the case, then why'd they kill Nikki and Paulo?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Who knows why those people do anything? What matters is they could be out there right now waiting to get us.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: I dunno, dude. I was with the Others, like, two weeks ago, they're on a total other side of the Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SUN: Then who dragged me into the jungle?  The Others came into our camp, they grabbed me, put a bag over my head. And if I hadn't gotten away, they would have killed me.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Look, y'all stay here.  Lemme see if I can see any sign of 'em. I'll do a perimeter sweep.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Where'd you get the gun?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Got it off one of them.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: And when were you gonna let us know?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: I guess right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: What exactly is a perimeter sweep?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE:  Heyб shouldn't we cover them up?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SUN: Yes, of course.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 Flashback - 32 days ago. At night, Paulo is on the beach digging through his carry-on bag that he found in the waterfall earlier. He opens and chews some nicotine gum before beginning to bury the Matryoshka doll in the sand.]
Lost.Season03.Episode14 LOCKE: Nice night.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 LOCKE: What you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 LOCKE: It looks like you're digging a hole. Every man's entitled to his secrets Paulo, but can I give ya a piece of advice?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Please, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 LOCKE: You should put the shovel away and save yourself some trouble.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Why is that?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 LOCKE: Things don't stay buried on this Island. The beach is eroding. Winter's coming, high tide. Whatever it is you're hiding, make sure you pick a spot that won't wash away. See you back at camp.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BEN: Who left this open?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 JULIET: Tom was down here a couple of days ago.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BEN: Have him cover it up with the plane.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 JULIET: That him? Shephard?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BEN: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 JULIET: He's cute. Why are we doing this? Shephard will never agree to do the surgery.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BEN: No, I can convince him to do it.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 JULIET: How?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BEN: Same way I get anybody to do anything. I find out what he's emotionally invested in, and I exploit it.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 JULIET: So, what? We just grab all three of them, Ford and Austen too?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BEN: No, they need to come to us.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 JULIET: And how do we make that happen?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 BEN: Michael, of course.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 JULIET: Are we done here? This place gives me the creeps.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Hey! Desmond! You hear about what happened to Nikki and Paulo?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 DESMOND: Aye. Tragic.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: So, do you know anything?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 DESMOND: How do you mean?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Can you, you know, use your psychic powers?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 DESMOND: Doesn't work like that. I only see flashes.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: No offense dude, but as far as superpowers go, yours is kinda lame. Thanks anyway.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 DESMOND: I do know that she was with your mate this morning.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: My mate?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 DESMOND: I saw her with your boy Sawyer. The dead girl, Nikki.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: He said he didn't know her.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 DESMOND: Then why was she yelling at him?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Yelling?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 DESMOND: Aye.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: At Sawyer, this morning?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 DESMOND: Right before she died.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Vincent! Dude!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: So he saw Sawyer and Nikki fighting. That doesn't prove anything.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Look at the facts, and ask yourself. Why is Sawyer so gung-ho about investigating this? What's in it for him? He pretended he didn't know their names, but then he was fighting with Nikki.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SUN: Sawyer's not a murderer. He went all the way across the Island to help Michael. It is the Others, I know what they can do.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: OK, you know what, I'll go get Desmond. He'll tell you exactly what he saw.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: Sun. It was me.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SUN: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE: It was me who took you, not the Others. I wasn't myself. After Locke hit me. After he humiliated me. Sawyer told me I could get even by helping him steal the guns, we just made it look like, the Others. I didn't mean to hurt you.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 CHARLIE:  Sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 LOCKE: Hey everybody. We're heading out to the Pearl station, there's a computer there that might help us find our people. Anybody wanna come along?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI:  I'll go.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 LOCKE: Great.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 LOCKE: Anybody else wanna come, meet us at the tree line in 10 minutes, and bring water.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: You're not serious.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: What? You always whine about not being included. Now's our chance.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Hey guys. What are these other TVs for?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 LOCKE: Sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: All these TVs. This guy says that there's six stations,  
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: The toilet still works.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Give me the gun.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: The hell you talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Give it to me.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Ain't even loaded.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Then how are you sweeping the perimeter? Quit lying dude. Desmond saw you fighting with Nikki this morning.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Oh I see what this is. Villagers have got themselves some torches.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Did you kill them?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: No. No, I didn't kill them. Yeah, me and Nikki went at it this morning. Cause she wanted a gun.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Why didn't you tell us this before?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Cause of the dirt under her nails.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: She was digging. And when we found him I saw a fresh mound of dirt. She was burying something. And if you take the time to dig a hole right before you die, then what you're hiding's probably pretty damn good.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SUN: So what was it? What did she hide?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Go ahead, take 'em. Cause whatever happened to those two, I had nothing to do with it.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Did you know Thanksgiving was two weeks ago?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: We missed it, Paulo, just like we're gonna miss everything.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: They're going to find us. We'll get rescued. You'll see.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI:  OK, where did this sudden burst of optimism come from?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: I dunno, I guess, it's how we look at things. Like the bag. I mean, maybe not finding it was good for us.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: How do you figure that?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Look what it did. It might have torn us apart.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Wait here. I'm gonna get us some breakfast.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI:  OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: OK, I know you have them. Give me a gun.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: I don't have the guns. A-team took 'em all.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Right, except for the ones you kept for yourself.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Even if I had a gun I wouldn't give it to you. Judging by the fire you're breathing, I got a feeling no good would come of it.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Sawyer, give me a gun.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: I got a better idea, sister. How about you go stick your head in the ocean and cool yourself off?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Thanks for nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: And who the hell are you?!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER:  Thanks for nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SUN: Charlie told me it was your idea. To kidnap me.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER:  You gonna tell Jin?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SUN: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Why not?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SUN: Because then we'd have to dig another grave.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Why are you giving me these?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SUN: Because they're worthless here.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: See, and I thought I was going to get out of this without a —
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Nikki and Paulo. I guess we didn't really know you very well. And it appears, you killed each other for diamonds. But I know there are good parts to you too. You were always nice to me. And you're a member of the camp. And... I really loved Exposé. OK then, goodbye—
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Wait.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 SAWYER: Rest in peace, Nikki and Paulo.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Come on. You can just tell me.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Na-uh, it's a surprise. We're almost there. OK, ready?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: I found the diamonds, Paulo.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO:  What? Where?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Right here.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Give 'em to me.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: What're you talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: What am I talking about?  What's this? Your nicotine gum. You wanted to stop looking for the bag cause you'd already found it. I know you have them, Paulo, so where are they?!
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Calm down, OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: What the hell's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: Are you out of your mind?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: You remember Dr. Arzt's friend. Did it bite you? Does it hurt? He told me why they call it the Medusa Spider. Wanna know why?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: What did you do?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Because one look from Medusa will turn anyone to stone, just like one bite from the spider will paralyze you, for about eight hours. It won't kill you, it'll just slow your heart rate down to the point of where even a doctor would have a hard time—
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: —hearing it beat. You won't be able to move a muscle, so I'll be able to do, all sorts of nasty things to you. And since it bit you on your neck, I'd say paralysis will happen fast. I'm guessing that you have the diamonds on you. Huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: In a shoe, maybe?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI:  I think I know where...
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: You're only sorry 'cause you got caught.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 PAULO: I was... afraid... of losing you. If you found the diamonds, you wouldn't need me any more.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Ow, dammit! Oh no! No! No, no.
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Er, you OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 HURLEY: Hey, hey, what happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode14 NIKKI: Para...lyzed.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Ah!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: I was just bringing you something to eat. Enjoy your sandwich.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 .
Lost.Season03.Episode15 TRUCK DRIVER: Been on the road a while, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: How long's it gonna take?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 TRUCK DRIVER: Well your fan belt's shot. Take two days, maybe three.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Three days for a fan belt?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 TRUCK DRIVER:  Welcome to Iowa. Name's Johnny.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: I'm Lucy.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: They're all 18-carat gold. 
Lost.Season03.Episode15 MAN: Come on, those don't look real. I'm not buying them. 
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JOHNNY:  If you need a lift into town, I'm finished up here in an hour.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 MAN: Call the cops!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Ah fine, whatever! Your loss.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JOHNNY: Hey, there a problem buddy?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 MAN: Yeah, yeah, there's a problem. I'm getting scammed here, that's a problem.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Look, I'm sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 MAN: What'ya think, I'm an idiot?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Hey man if you don't wanna buy 'em you don't have to buy 'em.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 MAN: Those are fake necklaces, and you're a rip-off artist.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: They're real.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 MAN: Call the cops.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: If you don't want 'em, I'll sell 'em to somebody else...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Hey, lemme see those. My father owns a jewelery store, I think I can spot a fake. How much?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Sixty bucks.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: I'll take the one on the end.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 MAN: Whatever.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Yeah.  Can I get my money back?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Hey! Why'd you help me?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Just one girl watching another girl's back I guess.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Or, you're stranded here, and for some reason you didn't want that guy calling the cops.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: I'll give ya a ride into town, you buy me a drink.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 LOCKE: Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: John! What are you doing? Did they capture you?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 LOCKE: Yes, but, only temporarily. I came to say goodbye.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Goodbye?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 LOCKE: I'm leaving with them.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: The hell is going on, I mean, what are they doing to you, are you brainwashed? Where did Jack go?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 LOCKE: Jack didn't go anywhere, Kate. He's gonna have to stay behind like you.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: You can't trust them. If they told you that they're going to take you home, they're lying—
Lost.Season03.Episode15 LOCKE: I don't want to go home, Kate. I want you to know, I made a strong case for you. I told them that you were a good person. Reliable, smart, honest. And then they told me who you were and what you had done. Let's just say forgiveness isn't one of their strong suits. Good luck.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: John, where are you going?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 LOCKE:  Coming out!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Hey, just... Where is Jack, and where is Sayid, have you seen Rousseau?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: John, please, what's happened to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 LOCKE: I'm sorry, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: The hell's wrong with you?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Don't look at me and pretend we're not talking. I'm not supposed to be here.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Good, then scram.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Dude, you need to know that... there's been some chatter. After Paulo and Nikki and everything. Well, tomorrow there's gonna to be a vote.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: A vote for what?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: To decide whether or not to banish you.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Banish me?! Where?!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Well, there's debate about that, but the consensus was half a mile down the beach.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Consensus?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: I'm only saying this because there may be a way to fix it. To, like, make amends.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: I don't do amends.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Might wanna ask yourself, about all the good stuff that comes from being a part of this... society. I mean you can't even feed yourself. You use our latrine, drink the water that Steve brings every morning to the trough—
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Er...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: You know how for three days, ten hours and fifteen minutes I ain't allowed to use nicknames?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Yeah?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Well, you, Sir Hugo, are rotund, annoying, and you're ruining my damned view. How's that for amends?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: You're making a big mistake, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER:  Banish me...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: How 'bout you tell me your name?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: It's Lucy.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: And what's your real name? Next time somebody asks you, don't think about it.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: I didn't thi--
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Not even for a second.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: So, why Lucy?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: She's a saint. Memorized them all in Sunday school so I figured they're probably still all rattling around my brain.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: What makes a girl who went to Sunday school scared of cops?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: A few months ago, I killed my stepfather, and escaped from the Marshal who arrested me for it.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY:  Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE:  Cause he was a bad guy.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: So, the hell are you doing in Iowa?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: I wanna talk to my mother.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: You're gonna have a real hard time doing that. Because if you did what you just said you did, then the Feds are gonna be watching her 24/7.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: I'll figure something out.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Oh you will, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: What, you wanna help me?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY:  Absolutely.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY:  I fell in love with the wrong guy. And then I gave him my life savings. He conned me, and embarrassed me. He was a bad guy. So, I'll help you get the meeting with your Mom, Lucy, because one of us deserves something good.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: I ain't gonna get the Korean vote.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Oh, oh, what the... shoo! Come here, come on...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Alright, let's do it.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Do what?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: I'm ready to do it. Make amends. Change the vote. I don't wanna be banished, OK? You happy?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Dude you stink. What is that, fish?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Did you try to gut one yourself? How have you not learned that by now? I mean we've been here like, three months.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Can we just do this?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Do what?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER:  Make nice!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Apologize for calling me all those names.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER:  I'm really sorry I called you rotund.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Really?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Ah God, you're worse than a girl. Come on, let's, spread the love.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: What the hell am I doing here?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Why don't you tell me.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: I dunno.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Well, I dunno either, so why don't you let go of my wrist.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: So what the hell happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: I was making a cup of tea. Canister came in through the window.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: So what did you do to piss em off?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: You're wasting your time. The knife is too big, you need something smaller, a safety pin or..
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: We're going back.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: What? They did this to us, why would we go back?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: You say "they" like you didn't lock me in a cage and watch me break rocks all day. We're going back to your village because... my friends were probably gassed just like us. And your people are gone anyway. I saw them all pack up and leave.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Locke came in and said goodbye. They were taking off, going somewhere else.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Going, going where?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: He didn't... exactly tell me.  Welcome to the wonderful world of not knowing what the hell's going on.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 FEDERAL AGENT: Go go go!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 EDWARD MARS: On the ground!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 MARS: Get down! On the ground! Let me see those hands. Let me see those hands! Long time no see, Austen.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 MARS: Who the hell are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: I'm just selling Bibles!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Hi. They questioned for half an hour. He confiscated my case. He was asking me about selling Bibles and... ah, it's a good thing I know how to lie.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Yeah, now we know what we're up against, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Yeah, now we know that there were six guys waiting to take you down, Lucy.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Yeah, it's OK, I'll figure it out.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Figure it out? That Marshal, I don't know what you did to him, but if he ever gets his hands on you, it is going to be you or him.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Look, if you've changed your mind. If you don't wanna help me, I get it.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: No, I do wanna help you, but if I'm lying to federal agents, Lucy, so that you can have a chat with your Mom, then I at least need to know that there's a pretty good reason.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: He, uh, used to get drunk, and beat up my Mom. So I blew up his house. I made it look like an accident. A gas leak. Took out an insurance policy on the house, for her. Set her up for life. And then she gave me up. Chose him over me. So the reason I need to talk to her is, someone I love, someone who's supposed to care about me, betrayed me. And I wanna know why!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Well, then let's go find out.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: What are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Whoever dragged us out here left a trail, it'll lead us back to where we came from. Let's go.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: It's gonna rain. Don't you think we should wait 'til morning?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Why what?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Why would they handcuff you to me and then drag us all the way out into the jungle?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Ben has a thing for mind games.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: That why he left you behind?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Do we really have to talk?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Nope.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Come on, if the trail gets wet, I'll lose it.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: I hope you're not dragging me all the way back there with you for him.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Excuse me?!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: I hope you're not going back for Jack. Because I was standing right there, when he told you not to come back. And now that you've ruined his chance to get off the Island--
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: You done? I SAID ARE YOU DONE?!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: I... I'm sorry, I, I didn't mean to...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: What the hell is that?!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Get up.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: You dislocated my shoulder!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: GET, UP!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Quick, in here! Come on. Get in. Come on, get down, get down.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: What the hell?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Shh... up.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Are we safe?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: You tell me.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: I ain't kissing no damn baby.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Claire's, like, really influential. If she votes for you to stay, you're home free dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Well, why wouldn't she vote for me? It's not like I ever done anything bad to her.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Nah, but you never did anything good for her either. And have you ever even asked how Aaron is?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Wel,l I know how he is. He... cries loud and he smells.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: You see, that's what I'm talking about. You're sarcastic, people don't like that.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Alright. So I go over. Do what?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Moms love it when you show an interest in their babies. You should go over there, say something nice. Call her Claire. And give her this  I know you can do it, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Hey, Claire.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CLAIRE:  Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER:  Hey there, little baby  ... Aaron.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CLAIRE: Is, er, is there anything I can do for you?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: No. I just came by to say, your baby's... he's not as wrinkly as he was a couple weeks ago.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CLAIRE:  Yeah, I, I guess he's not. Thanks!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Oh, and er, this is for you. 
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CLAIRE: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: I don't like, blankets. Well, goodnight.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CLAIRE: Goodnight.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Do you think it's gone? Are we safe?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Are you serious? You've never seen that?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Oh, if you don't believe me, you can always pull my other shoulder out of its socket.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: I was, I wasn't trying to...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Don't flatter yourself. This is the fourth time it's been dislocated.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Give me your hand.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Cause I want you to pop it back in.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: No, I'm not gonna...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: You're gonna. Right now it feels like there's broken glass under my skin, and if it weren't for you, I would be on my way home right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Jack told me not to come back to protect me. Because he didn't want me to get hurt.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Is that what you think?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Yeah that's what I think.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: We have cameras on the cages, Kate. All of them. He saw you, you and Sawyer. The reason Jack told you not to come back, wasn't because he didn't want you to get hurt, it was because you broke his heart. So, grab my wrist, push up and twist!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Why do we gotta be out here so damn early?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DESMOND: You asked me to help you catch a boar. Well, this is when they break cover to eat.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Looks like they picked a day to sleep in.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DESMOND: So what's your angle, brother?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: My angle?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DESMOND: Well, you... haven't spoken three words to me and then, suddenly you want to be my hunting partner.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: My angle, is that I got hearts and minds to change. And politics is all about bribes. Since money don't mean squat on this Island, I gotta give the people something they like. And people like meat...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DESMOND: Shh.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: How's your shoulder?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Awesome.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Then let's get going.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DIANE: You're welcome sweetheart.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Oh my God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DIANE: No worries.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: I'm such an idiot.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DIANE: It happens all the time, sweetheart.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DIANE: Uh, thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Hi, Mom.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DIANE: What are you doing here, Katherine?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: You look good.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DIANE: I asked you what you are doing here.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: I wanna know why you told them what I did to Wayne.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DIANE: I thought maybe you came 'cause you wanted to say you were sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: I'm not sorry. He hit you, he treated you like a dog, and you...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DIANE: You can't help who you love, Katherine. And for good or bad, I loved him. And you burnt him alive. You turned on the gas, and you lit a match. You murdered him in cold blood!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: I did it for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 DIANE: No. What you did, you did for yourself.  I have to go back to work. Because you are my daughter, I'm not going to tell the two men sitting at the table who've been following me for the last month that you are here. But I swear to God, Katie, if I ever see you again, the first thing I will do is yell for help. Goodbye.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Did he say that to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: That I broke his heart.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: He didn't have to.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: You don't know anything about him.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: I know where he was born. I know what his parents did for a living. I know that he was married. And who he was married to. I know why he got a divorce. I know how his father died. I know his height, his weight, his birthday, and his blood type. What do you know about him, Kate?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE:  Let's go.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Run, run, run.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Get up, run, run, come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Stop.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Wait, what are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: I know what happens when you step through those things...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: They're off. Kate! We can—
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: We'll go alongside—
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: We don't need to, we can go—
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: ...Go around...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: ...They're off...... dammit.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: You're gonna wanna be over here.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Kate, come on!
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Alright. We don't know what it is, but we know it doesn't like our fences...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: You had a key.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: They left me behind too, they gassed me! I know that you don't care, but the people I spent the last three years of my life with, they just left me! I thought that maybe, maybe if I could make you think that we were in it together. Maybe I wouldn't get left behind again.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Ahaha.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CHARLIE: Mmm. Ah, its delicious.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Just a little DHARMA-A1 and paprika. I hope you'll remember this little barbecue at your meeting later.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CHARLIE: Oh what meeting?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Hurley told me about the vote.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CHARLIE: Vote? Since when did anyone around here vote?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: You son of a bitch. There wasn't ever gonna be no vote.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: But, wasn't it nice, being nice.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: You tricked me into being decent. That's gotta be the lamest con in the history of cons.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Wasn't a con, dude. If you're gonna be our temporary leader, you need to do some damage control.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Leader? The hell are you smokin'?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Jack's gone. Locke's gone. Kate and Sayid. You're all we got. And Paulo and Nikki dying, we all looked to you. Then again, you totally tried to steal the diamonds, but we wanted to look to you. Look around, you made everyone happy. Just for today, they can eat boar, laugh and forget that they're totally screwed. And you did that for 'em, dude. You.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAWYER: Well, what if I don't wanna be the leader?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 HURLEY: Yeah well, I don't think Jack wanted it either. Sucks for you, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Sayid's in one of those backyards down there. I'll go get him. You should get Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Jack, Jack, hey, wake up, its me.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JACK: What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: They all left.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JACK: What? What?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Because of me. I'm so sorry. I should have listened to you. I never—  I wanted to come back to help you. But you didn't need me to. And now because of me you can't go.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JACK: They just, left? Even, even Juliet?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE:  No, they left her too.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JACK: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: You know her better than I do. Now what?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JACK: Now, now we go back.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Thanks for everything, Cassidy.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: You got it.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: So, this guy who ripped ya off. You gonna give me his name? Tell me where I can find him? You almost got arrested for me Cassidy, I wanna help you.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: I'm pregnant.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: Oh.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: It's his, the baby's his. And I still love him.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: So call the cops, have him locked up.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Will you ever forgive your Mom for calling the cops?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: No, no I won't.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 CASSIDY: Thanks, Lucy.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE: My name's Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JACK: You OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JULIET: Yeah. You?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAYID: Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JACK: Sayid.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAYID: I've checked all the house, everyone's gone, no weapons, no trail...
Lost.Season03.Episode15 KATE:  Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAYID: ...it's like 50 people disappeared into thin air.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JACK: We should take what we can find and head out while we still got light.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAYID: She is not coming with us.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JACK: Yes, she is.
Lost.Season03.Episode15 SAYID: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode15 JACK: Because they left her behind too.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAYID: It's getting late. This is a good place to make camp.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: I'll get some firewood.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 KATE: I'll go with you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 KATE: You wanna talk about it?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Talk about what?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 KATE: About the week... you spent over there with them.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Well, after you left, I'd, uh, I'd made a deal with them. If I took care of Ben, that they'd let me off the Island. So I just, kept my head down, did what I was supposed to. Didn't ask any questions.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 KATE: And that's it.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: That's it.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: OK. Let's have it.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAYID: I want to know what you people are doing on this Island. Why you're terrorizing us. Making lists. Kidnapping children. I want to know everything. But the first thing I'd like to know is, who are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Hi. I'm Juliet Burke, I'm with Mittelos Bioscience.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 GUARD: I'll let Mr. Alpert know you're here.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RACHEL: Well.  I think they're taking this whole corporate secrecy thing a little too seriously.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I'm never gonna fit in with these people.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 ETHAN: Hey there, Dr. Burke. If you pop the trunk, I'll get your bags.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD: Ah, you managed to find us.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I didn't even know they had an airport out there.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD: I know it surprises everyone. Hi. You must be Rachel. Richard Alpert.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RACHEL: Nice to meet you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD: Thank you for letting us borrow your sister for a few months.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RACHEL: Just promise me you'll bring her back in one piece.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD:  Well, we'll do our best. Uh, so listen, it's, er, a security thing. We have to take you in the rest of the way, so, whenever you're ready' we'll be waiting right over here, but please do take your time. Pleasure to meet you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RACHEL: Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RACHEL: It's better this way.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Is this a mistake? I shouldn't go. What if you get sick again?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RACHEL: I won't. Cancer's gone. And, I'm 100% preggers thanks to you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I'll be back...
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RACHEL: Yes, I know.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: ...before you give birth, I promise.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RACHEL: I know. Don't worry about us, OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RACHEL: You spent your whole life working to get here. So... don't blow it!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I love you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RACHEL: I love you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RACHEL: Go make us proud.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAYID: Who are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: If I told you who I was, if I told you everything that I know, you'd kill me.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAYID: What do you think I'll do if you don't?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Leave her alone.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAYID: Sooner or later she'll answer my questions.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: She'll answer your questions when she's ready. And you'll wait until she is. She's under my protection.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Claire? Claire? Claire?  Oh, oh, what is it? Oh, it's OK. Shh, shh, its OK. Claire? Hey. Claire. You OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CLAIRE: Charlie? What's, what's going on?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Didn't you hear Aaron?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CLAIRE: Is he OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Nah, he's OK. Are you alright?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CLAIRE: Yeah, I just, feel a little bit off. I didn't sleep well. I can't believe I didn't hear him crying!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Maybe you're coming down with something. Look, why don't you let me take Aaron, and, you get some more rest.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CLAIRE: Yeah, do you mind?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Absolutely.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CLAIRE:  I won't sleep long.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I guess it's no use asking them to wait up, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: They'll come around. Just give them some time.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: My people kept Sayid chained to a swing-set for three days, then I dragged Kate into the jungle, handcuffed myself to her and lied about it. How much time do you think they need?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: We'll be back at our beach in a couple of hours, they'll probably be over it by then.  You nervous?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Hell, yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD: I know that, uh, six months sounds like an eternity, but you're gonna be amazed at how time flies once you're there.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I can't wait to find out where there is.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 ETHAN: Dr. Burke? Wanna have a seat? I'd like to take some of your vitals. If that's OK with you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Yeah, sure.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD: You know, everyone at the company's really excited about you coming down Dr. Burke. And I think your research is really gonna have a major impact on us.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: What is that?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD: That, is orange juice, with a considerable amount of tranquilizer mixed in.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET:  You want me to drink it?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD: Oh yes , you're gonna wanna be asleep for the trip, Dr. Burke.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 ETHAN: It can be , kind of intense.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Er, OK, I was fine with signing all over your paperwork. Fine with agreeing to not talk to anyone in my life for six months. Fine with the fact that no one in the medical community has ever heard of Mittelos Bioscience.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD: Why were you fine?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD: Why were you fine with those things? It seems like, er, quite a leap for a job opportunity. I mean, we're not paying you that much. I think you're fine because deep down a part of you knows that the place we're taking you to is special.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Special huh.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD: Let me ask you something, Juliet. You took a woman, your own sister, whose reproductive system was ravaged by chemotherapy, who was sterile. And you made her pregnant. You created life where life wasn't supposed to be. That's a gift, Juliet. You have a gift. And don't you think you're meant to do something significant with it? Where we're going, you can do just that.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Where exactly are we...
Lost.Season03.Episode16 RICHARD: I can't tell you that. But what I can tell you is that, you'll see things there that you never imagined. Now, no one is forcing you to do anything, so if you change your mind, we're happy to take you back to—
Lost.Season03.Episode16 ETHAN: Um, you probably shouldn't have drunk that so fast.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 ETHAN: Good morning.  No, no, its OK. You'll be hoarse for a few hours but it gets better as the day goes on. Sorry I had to, strap you in, but the last leg is always a little bumpy. Watch your head. Give me your hand.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 ETHAN: We're here.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Here where?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Hello, Dr. Burke. My name is Benjamin Linus.  I'm really looking forward to working with you. Watch your step here.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Hey, wow,  that's too much water, its going to be all soggy.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 HURLEY: It's oatmeal dude, it's supposed to be soggy.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: Well if it ain't three men and a baby... I counted Hugo twice. Oh what, come on, I used your name.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CLAIRE: Hey. Does anybody know where there's any aspirin?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 DESMOND: Claire, you don't look so good.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: What are you doing up? You're meant to be in bed.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CLAIRE: Yeah. No, I know, I just... my head's pounding.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: I got you covered, two aspirin coming right up.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CLAIRE: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SUN: Jack? It's Jack!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: The hell is she doing here?!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 HURLEY: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 HURLEY: So. You're, like, one of them, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I'm Juliet.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 HURLEY: I don't remember you from the dock. Where you put bags on our heads. After you shocked us.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I had the day off.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 HURLEY: So I hear you're a doctor.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I'm really more of a researcher.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 HURLEY: Uh-huh.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: They send you over here to keep an eye on me?  OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 HURLEY: The last one of you guys that came over here. Ethan. He kidnapped Claire, and... Charlie got upset. We buried him over there.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 ETHAN: She's gone, Juliet, she's dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 GOODWIN: It's OK. You tried. You go ahead and take off. I'll talk to Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: It was Sabine's choice to get pregnant. She knew she was taking a risk.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I think it happens at conception. And if that's the case, there's nothing I can do about it, at least not here.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: I'm not sure I understand.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: The only way to see if I'm right is to take a woman off the Island, back to Miami.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: No, you're not taking anybody off the Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: In that case, there's nothing more I can do. I know you put a lot of faith in me, Ben. And I'm sorry I couldn't help you. My sister's giving birth in three months, and I haven't even been able to call her. It's time for me to go home.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Your sister won't be giving birth in three months, Juliet. She'll be dead before then. Her cancer is back.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Where did you get this?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Mikhail. I'm sorry, I should have told you sooner, I just didn't see what good it would do.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: What good it would do?! I could have gone home, I could have been with her!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: You still can. You can go home, Juliet. Be with her in her final days, or you can stay here and help me with our problem.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Why would I stay?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Because if you do, I will cure your sister's cancer.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I'm supposed to take that on faith?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: You've been here for six months. You've done extensive work-ups on all of us, have you seen even a trace of cancer?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: That's here. And being that you won't let me my sister here, I'm going to need more—
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Jacob said he would take care of it himself. Unless, of course, you don't have faith in him. Every woman on this Island needs you. If you choose to stay, I promise you, we will save Rachel's life.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SUN: Trust her? She's one of them.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Not anymore. They left her behind.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Oh yeah, where'd they go?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: I told you, I dunno.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, maybe we better ask her.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: She doesn't know either.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, here's a wacky idea. Let's stick our resident Iraqi on her. Let him do what he does, then see what she says.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAYID: No, I don't do that anymore.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: Well ain't that convenient.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAYID: But I don't trust her, Jack. If she's so innocent, why won't she answer my questions?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Just give her some time, she's afraid.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAYID: How much time?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Look, the fact that I trust her should be enough.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAYID: It's not.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 DESMOND: Where did Locke go?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: He went with them. Right after he destroyed the sub, the sub that was gonna take me off this Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: They were gonna let you go?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: Said who?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: Ben. Whose life you saved.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 KATE: Sawyer, lay off.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: You should have let that bug-eyed bastard die.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 KATE: He did it for us.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: Sounds like he did it for him.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 KATE: James.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Something you wanna ask me, Sawyer?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: Yeah Jack, I wanna ask you why you're fighting every one of us and sticking up for one of them.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Look, I spent every moment over there trying to find a way off this Island—
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Claire?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: —I was trying to help all of us. I was trying to get us rescued.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Claire... Jack! There's something wrong with Claire!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Put her head back, put her head back. Let's get her up. How long's she been like this?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Er, she started feeling bad this morning.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Before she got back, was she showing any symptoms at all?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: No, she was fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: What about water, has she been drinking enough water?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: I think so, yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Alright, keep that head up.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET:  What happened to her?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JIN: 무슨 상관이야?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SUN: He said, what do you care?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Kate! I need your help. I need you to go and get Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 KATE: Look, he's busy right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Please, I have to talk to him.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 KATE: You wanna tell me why you need Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Because I think I know what's wrong with Claire.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 KATE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Because I did it to her.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: Giving you a bad feeling in your stomach?  Yeah, me too.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Claire's immune system is turning on her. She's having a latent reaction to a medication in her bloodstream.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: What medication?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: It was designed to keep her alive during the late stages of her pregnancy.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Designed by who?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET:  By me. For some reason, the women here can't have babies. The mother's body turns on the pregnancy, treats it as a foreign invader. I saw it happen over and over. Every pregnant woman on this Island died.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: That is, every pregnant woman until Claire.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: What did you do to her?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: One of our people infiltrated your camp, and began taking blood samples, right after your plane crashed.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 KATE: Ethan.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Even though Claire didn't conceive on this Island, we found that her symptoms were consistent with previous mothers, so we tried to save her life.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: By kidnapping her?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: No! That wasn't supposed to happen. She was our control case. I had developed a serum that I thought would reverse what was happening to her, Ethan was administering the injections. But then... you found out that he wasn't on the plane.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 HURLEY: The census, I interviewed everyone. One of them isn't in the manifest — he wasn't on the plane.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: So... he improvised.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 ETHAN: Hello there.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: He kidnapped her, on his own. That was never the plan. Look, I know how this sounds, but without those injections, Claire would have died. Without the serum, she's going into a form of withdrawal, and if I don't treat her quickly, her immune system could shut down entirely. Jack! I can fix this. I just need the serum. Ethan kept a stash of medical supplies near the caves where you used to live. If I go right now I can be back before its too late.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Do it. Get moving.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 GOODWIN: Where are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: In bed, with you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 GOODWIN: Uh-huh. And where were you?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I was just realizing... that tomorrow I will have been on this Island for three years.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 GOODWIN: Hm, well, then I better bake a cake.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Stay here.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 GOODWIN: What have you got there?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Karl developed some X-rays for me.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 GOODWIN: What's wrong?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 UNNAMED OTHER: Morning, Juliet.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Hi.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Can I come in?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Of course. I was just finishing Carrie. I still don't know why you picked it, but boy is it depressing—
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: You have a tumor.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: When you told me about your back pain, I said that I would take some X-rays to see if it was a small fracture or a herniated disc. But that's not your problem. Your problem is a large tumor surrounding your L-4 vertebra.  You're surprised.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Well, you just told me I have cancer, Juliet, of course I'm surprised.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: No, I told you that you had a tumor.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Why are you scared?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: I'm not scared.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Why are you scared, Ben? You said no one on this Island ever had cancer, you told me that.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: I know what I told you, Juliet—
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: You told me you could fix it. You said that, you said that you cured my sister, you lied to me!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN:  No, I did not lie to you!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: If you can cure cancer Ben, then why do you have it?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN:  I don't know.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I want to talk to her. I want to talk to Rachel, I want to talk to her, now!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: It's not going to happen Juliet, but I can promise you that Rachel is fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: You never cured her!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: I did!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: You're a liar!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: No, Juliet—
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: YOU LIED TO ME!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: I told you the truth!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: I gave you my word.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET:  I know. I wanna go home. I wanna go home, Ben, please. Can't you please just let me go home?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN:  No.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAYID: Step away from the case!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Listen to me, Sayid.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAYID: Step back.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: It's full of medical supplies. They're for Claire. Jack knows all about it.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: Jack ain't here right now is he?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I'm telling you the truth.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAYID: You said earlier if you told me everything you knew, I'd kill you. I'm going to test the validity of that statement.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: He means talk.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: We don't have time for this.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 SAWYER: We cleared our schedules. We got all the time in the world.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: You know it's interesting... that you two are now the camp's moral police. I'm curious, Sayid, how long was it before you told everyone on that beach exactly how many people you've tortured in your life. Do they know about Basra? And I'm sure the first thing you did when you got here, James, was to gather everyone in a circle, and tell them about the man you shot in cold blood the night before you got on the plane. So why don't we just skip the part where you two pretend to be righteous. I'm taking that medication back to Claire. And you're gonna let me. Because if she doesn't get it, she's gonna die. And the last thing, that either of you need right now, is more blood on your hands.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Goodwin. Ethan. There might actually be survivors. And you're one of them, a passenger, you're in shock. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in three days. Go!  So I guess I'm out of the bookclub?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Juliet. Juliet! I was looking for you this morning. You and I need to talk.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Now?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: We have some time. It's important. Take a walk with me.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN:  Mikhail? We're here.  He never has his walkie on.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: What are we doing here?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: There's something I need to show you. Mikhail! It's Ben. I'm here with Juliet, we're approaching the house.  Don't shoot us...
Lost.Season03.Episode16 MIKHAIL: Well hurry up then.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 MIKHAIL: Did you see it?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail. Of course we saw it. What do you have so far?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 MIKHAIL: Oceanic Flight 815. Left Sydney Australia headed for Los Angeles, 324 people onboard including the flight crew.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: I want detailed files on every single passenger.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 MIKHAIL: Already working on it.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Can we uplink to Richard in Acadia Park please?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN:  Yesterday you called me a liar. I was hurt by that.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Hello, Richard, can you hear me?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Notice today's date, this is live. OK, Richard.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Oh my god. Oh! Oh my god!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: A little over two years ago, to everyone's complete surprise, Rachel's cancer went into complete remission. Shortly after she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. His name is Julian.  OK, thank you Richard. You'll wanna get back here as soon as you can; we may have some new visitors.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Oh, god! No! No!
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: I'm not a liar, Juliet.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I want to go home.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: That's not our agreement, you need to stay here until your work is finished.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: It's impossible. The mothers keep dying.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Then we'll find more mothers. Who knows, maybe there's even one on that plane.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Wait, what're you doing? She's not touching Claire — she's the one who did this to her.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: She can help her, Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Says who? Her? How can you even trust her?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: I do trust her. You trust me? Do you trust me?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CHARLIE: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Give us a couple of minutes here, OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: How long before this takes effect?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: We should see results in a few hours.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Juliet. If this doesn't work, if something happens to her. I'm not going to be able to protect you anymore. You'll be on your own.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I'm already on my own, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 CLAIRE: What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: Got a tarp. A couple of blankets. Some airline pillows. Its not much, but it'll get you started. Claire's awake. There's a... a lean-to that we've been using for shade. And, everyone says that it'll be alright if you set up camp there. For now.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: They're good people. They're willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. But eventually they're gonna need some answers.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: Why don't you? You keep talking about them. Why don't I ever have to explain myself to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JACK: You were there. You were standing right next to me when that submarine exploded. In that moment, I saw it in your eyes. You wanna get off this island more than anything else in the world. That makes you one of us.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN:  Let's go over it again.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I know what to do.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Let's go over it again. Just to be sure.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I drag Austen out into the jungle, handcuff myself to her, then tell her I was gassed, just like she was.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: And if she catches you in the lie?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I'll admit to it. Tell her it was the only way to earn her trust.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN:  Good. What then?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: They'll take me back to the beach.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I know you want me to go there, but after everything we've done to them, its going to be a problem.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: We've activated the implant in Claire, she should be symptomatic within the next 48 hours. By the time you get to that camp, you'll have a nice big crisis to solve.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET: I'll need supplies.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN: Pryce is already on his way. He'll hide the case at Ethan's old drop-point. Tell Jack that you can save her. He trusts you... are you alright?
Lost.Season03.Episode16 JULIET:  I'm fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode16 BEN:  See you in a week.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: You're insane mate. Superman can fly around the entire planet in the blink of an eye.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Dude, if we're going by a pure footrace, Supes would get dusted by The Flash.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: But, why would the Man of Steel agree to a sodding footrace?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Er, for charity. And Flash would totally win 'cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE:  Oohh vibration, whatever would Superman do if he came up against a wall?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Well, no smashing allowed.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: No flying, no smashing, any other restrictions I need to know about? Perhaps we should fit Superman with a pair of Kryptonite...
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: The hell?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Charlie!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: 가만히 있어!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Don't, don't touch it.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Just breathe, just breathe huh.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Don't try to talk mate. We've gotta get back.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: No, you help!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: I can't help!  I'm sorry mate.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Hey, here it is.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Superman can fly around the entire planet...
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Hey. Where's the wire?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: D'you eat those mushrooms Jack warned us about?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Listen to me, there's a wire, a cable buried in the sand. Do you know what I'm talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: This is future crap, isn't it?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: The cable, do you know where it is?! This is important.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Superman can...
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND:  Because someone's coming.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: God tests our faith in many ways. So, as you well know, we have our own test here. A vow of silence that lasts as long as we see fit. This challenges both one's patience and his faith. For some, it may last a week. Those we are less sure about, a month. Personally, Desmond, I never thought you'd last. And so now I stand corrected. For whatever reason, your path has led you here. And now you're one of us. Welcome, brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Thank you, brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Morning, Jack. Must be nice to wake up in your own bed.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: Yep, home sweet home.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Listen, I was wondering if I could borrow your first-aid kit. Er, twisted my ankle.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: You want me to take a look at it?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Nah, you're alright. I've taped my share of ankles.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: Right.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: Something wrong Hurley?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Nah, uh uh, just, keeping Desmond here company. 'Cause, we're friends.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK:  Bring that back when you're done with it, OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Absolutely.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: What the hell was that? Do you want him to get suspicious?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Suspicious of what? Oh, this is like when you knew Claire was drowning, isn't it? That's why you got the first-aid kit, someone's gonna get hurt. Is it me?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: No. It's just a precaution.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Look, dude. You want me to take you to the wire, I want an explanation.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: I saw a sequence of events. Things that are gonna happen.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: What'd you see?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: It was, it was like a sorta jigsaw puzzle. Only I didn't have the picture in the box, so I dunno how the pieces fit exactly, but... but one of the pieces, the first one...
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: ... It was you, pulling the cable out the sand.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: So what are the other pieces?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: If I tell you that, it'll change the picture in the box.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: So what? Isn't that the point? Preventing something bad?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Not this time.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: So you're not trying to stop something from happening, you actually want it to happen.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: More than anything.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Hey Freckles, you home?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Thought you weren't allowed to use nicknames.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Well, you weren't around when I lost the bet, so you're—
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: ...Exempt.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: What's up?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Uh, I wanted to ask you something.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Yep.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: I'm up here.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Uh ... so did you tell him?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Did I tell who what?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: You know, did you tell the Doc? About you and me.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: No. But he knows. He saw us on one of those surveillance monitors.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: I thought you said the camera was broken?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Well they had another camera.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER:  Perverts.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Anyway, he knows.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Well, now that... that's out of the way, maybe a little afternoon delight?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: It means sex.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: I know.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Come on, Freckles, wait, now look, you need me to make ya a mix tape?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Yeah, why don't you do that.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Dude, you're gonna have to tell me again. What do we need Jin for?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Because he was there with us.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: On the beach, when I find the cable.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY:  Here it is!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND:  That's right.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: In one of your puzzle flashes.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Aye.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: So, if he doesn't come, then neither does the someone you won't tell me anything about.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: That'd be the long and short of it. But I've no bloody idea how I'm gonna get him to come with us.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Watch the master.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: Camping?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Yeah, you know, like sleeping under the stars, fire on the beach. Marshmallows.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN:  Camping.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY:  Everybody likes marshmallows.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND:  Good man. Get food, water.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Where are you going?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: We need one more.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: How daft do you think I am? This isn't a camping trip. You've had another one of your visions, haven't you? What was it this time?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Someone's coming to the Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Coming? As in someone who's not already here, how the hell is that gonna happen?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Can't tell ya.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: It's got nothing to do with me?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Well, you're a part of it, yeah. As are Jin and Hurley.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Right, but with all due respect, you haven't previously told Jin or Hurley that they're gonna die.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Well, that's not gonna happen. Not this time.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE:  Can I bring my guitar?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND:  Absolutely.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Alright, I'm in. You had me worried there for a second.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: This is it.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: But, how can you tell?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: 'Cause that's exactly where I followed the wire into the jungle.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Where is it then?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: 이거지?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Way to go, dude!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Here it is!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Just one thing, last time I followed this wire into the jungle, I almost got kebabed by one of Rousseau's spiky death-trap things.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND:  Cut her down!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: We're not going in the jungle, well, not yet. It's getting late, so we'll, er, we'll camp here the night.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN:  Camp.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: So when do they get here? Your mysterious someone.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Soon.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: You do realize you are free to talk again, Brother Desmond.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Used to being quiet, I suppose.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Moriah. I find the name the brothers have chosen for the wine made here, interesting.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: And why is that brother?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Well, Moriah's the mountain where Abraham was asked to kill Isaac. It's not exactly the most... festive locale, is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: And yet God spared Isaac.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Well, one might argue then, God may not have asked Abraham to sacrifice his son in the first place.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: Well, then it wouldn't have been much of a test, would it brother? Perhaps you underestimate the value of sacrifice.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK 2: Brother Desmond. Brother Desmond. I met this man waiting at the gates, he says he needs to have a word with you.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MAN:  Sorry, sir.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Forgive me, brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: The oatmeal's awesome.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: It is, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: It's strange, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: What's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Being back. Not... looking for a way out of a cage. Not... finding a reason to go running off into the jungle again. I almost don't know what to do with myself.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: Well, enjoy it, I'm sure something will go wrong soon enough.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Well, my big dangerous adventure for tonight is gonna be doing the dishes, in the ocean.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: Be careful.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: I'll try.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: Erm, can I borrow that spoon?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: Thanks. Good night.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Yeah, good night.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: What, my doorbell busted again? What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Shut up and don't talk.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: You crying?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: I said shut up.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: You got it.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN:  '하느님, 감사합니다. 저는 갈고리 손인줄 알고 무서웠어요.' 그러니까 그 남자가 웃으면서 이 말 했지.  '걱정 마세요, 소녀 아가씨. 내 갈고리 손은 니 애비 머리 속에 아직도... shout 박혀 있다!'
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Dude, I love the part about the bird. It was a bird right?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN:  You.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Me? OK, erm, have you heard the one about the Chupacabra..
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: Chupa...?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Yeah, like a bear with spines...
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Who's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Her name's Penny.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: That's not bad, Des. Not bad at all. So how did you manage to leave her behind and come here?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Because I'm a coward.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: You and me both pal. You know, I tried to run away from her, and she, she tracked me down. With enough money and determination, you can find anyone, she said. And I used to wake up at nights, thinking if she actually meant it, that she never gave up, that maybe she's spent the last three years looking for me.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: What's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Is that a helicopter?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: Rescue!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Uh, is that how a helicopter's supposed to sound?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: We gotta go out there.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Out there?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Well, yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: In what?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Well, we gotta do something.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: Look.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Oh my god.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: Pallet.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Nah, dude, it's not a food drop, you saw the beacon thing, someone like ejected.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Yeah, but that was a helicopter, you can't eject from a helicopter.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Well, maybe they jumped. All that matters is that they're here.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: They, how do we even know it's a person?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY:  'Cause he said someone was coming.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Where you going?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Out to where it fell. Come on, let's go.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: No, whoa, slow down. We're not gonna trudge out into the jungle in the middle of the night.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Yes we are.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Were you even listening to Hurley when he mentioned Rousseau's death-trap? Now, it's going to be light in two hours, we'll wait until then.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: She can't wait.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: She?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: They. Whoever it is... could be hurt. We have to go, all four of us, now.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Because that's the way its supposed to happen.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Right, well, I guess, it's supposed to happen without me.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND:  We'll leave at first light then. Together.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Terrific.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Is your sister in?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MAN: Leave. Now.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 WOMAN: Let him be, Derek.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Hello, Ruth.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 RUTH: So you're a monk now, are ya?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Well, technically, I'm still what they call a novice, 'til the abbey...
Lost.Season03.Episode17 RUTH:  Why are you here, Desmond?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Well, now that my initiation's done, I felt like I owed you an explanation.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 RUTH: Desmond. You can never begin to explain what you did. You left one week before the wedding, everything was planned, bought and paid for. You just disappeared completely.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: I had a calling.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 RUTH: We dated for six years, and the closest you ever came to a religious experience was Celtic winning the cup.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: OK, yes, I was scared about the wedding, so I had a few pints too many, maybe, and I... I raised my eyes, and I asked, am I doing the right thing, and that's the last thing I remember. And when I woke up, I was lying on my back in the street, and I dunno how I got there, and... there was this man standing over me, Ruth. And he reached out his hand, and he said to me, "Can I help you brother?". And the first thing I noticed was the rope tied round his waist, and... I looked at him... and I knew. I knew... I was supposed to go with him. I was supposed to leave everything that mattered behind, sacrifice all of it... for a greater calling.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 RUTH: Well, it's a good thing a bloody shepherd didn't help you up, or I suppose you'd be off with the sheep wouldn't you? Next time you want to break up with someone, Des, don't join a monastery. Just tell the girl you're too bloody scared.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: You a doctor or a carpenter?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JULIET: What, your dad never taught you to use a hammer?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: No, my dad taught me how to drink.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JULIET: Oh, at least it's something.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Hope I'm not interrupting. You two arguing over who's your favourite Other?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: What do you want, Sawyer?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Well, what I wanted, Doc, was to inform you there's been some developments since you were AWOL. So tell me...
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: ...How's your backhand?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: So where'd you get the table?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Don't you recognize it? Fell out of the purple haze when the hatch went blammo. We don't play every hundred and eight minutes, the Island's gonna explode!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Finally, something I can beat you at.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: You know, considering I haven't played since I was 12, I wouldn't be too proud. What's that, 18th point?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: It's kinda strange, huh? Being back.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Something funny?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: Er, Kate said the same thing in the kitchen last night.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: She did huh.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: She did.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: Nineteenth point.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: So you guys ate together, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: No, Juliet and I had dinner together last night.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Huh.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JACK: Best two out of three?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: You got it.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: So what's next?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Next?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Yeah, you saw the wire, the flashy thing falling out of the sky. Now what? Maybe I can help you find--
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND:  That's it, there is no next. We find the beacon.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Why you lying to me mate?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Look, mate. I've saved your life three times now. If that hasn't bought me your trust, I don't know what will. Let's move.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Dude, seriously, I'm gonna have a coronary.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Actually you're not. And if you don't get a move on, we're not gonna make it before nightfall—
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Look at this.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: 이건 도대체 어디서 난 거야?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: It can't be Rousseau's. If it was Rousseau's, a massive rock would be flying at my head right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Don't move.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: What are you doing? Ow. Ah, ahh!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Did that come down with the flashing red light thingy?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: Walkie-talkie!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY:  No, dude. That's a satellite phone.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Crap, it's dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Shocker.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Oh my god.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Is that you? And who is she?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: That would be Penny.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: What's this?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Your mixtape.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Well, you gonna take it or ain't ya?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: The best of Phil Collins, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Don't get picky. And if Bernard asks, I don't know a thing about it.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: Thanks, James.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: So why'd you jump me last night?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: Was it 'cause you saw the Doc hanging out with Juliet?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 KATE: It is not like that.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 SAWYER: It's not? You ain't gotta use me Freckles, all you gotta do is ask.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: You think it's her, don't you?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Who?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Your girl. Penny. You think its actually her who bailed out the helicopter.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Earlier I hoped it. Now I know it.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Why didn't you tell us?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Would you come if I had?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Of course. Why wouldn't I?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: I didn't wanna tell you because... I didn't want anything to change.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Fair enough. Look, if whatever you're seeing leads to your girl getting us rescued, why would we want to change anything, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND:  Right.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND:  Right.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Thanks for the heads up about bringing an umbrella, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND:  Well it's a grand old team to play for, and it's a grand old team to see. And if you know your history, it's...
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: Brother Desmond. What are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Well, I believe I'm... getting pissed on our lovely wine.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: That bottle of our lovely wine fetches over a hundred quid. We've only bottled a hundred and eight cases this year.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Well, it's just as well we've taken a vow of poverty then, isn't it?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: We've also taken a vow of charity.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Right.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: Something tells me, Desmond, that you're not cut out to be a monk.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Well... ah, you know, I, I've had a tough week. I'm sorry for the wine. I'll take the penance.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: I'm afraid you're beyond penance, Desmond.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Brother Desmond.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: Not any more.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Are you firing me?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: I am indeed.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: You can't do that, I heard the call.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: I'm sure you did hear the call, but the abbey clearly isn't where you were meant to end up. I have little doubt that God has different plans than you being a monk, Desmond. Bigger plans—
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Oh aye, I'm sure he does.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: He does! You've just spent too much time running away to realize what you may be running toward.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Hey. What am I supposed to do now?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: Whatever comes next.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: Who's Penny?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: She's a chick Desmond used to date. And now he thinks she fell from the sky. So we're gonna go save her life, and she's gonna get us rescued... Dude, even if I spoke Korean, it wouldn't make any sense.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Hey, we'll move faster if we stop talking. She might be hurt.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: I'm moving as fast as I can. In case you haven't noticed dude, I'm not exactly the Flash.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: The Flash is pathetic.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: You got something against the fastest man alive?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: You're insane, mate. Superman can fly around the entire planet in the blink of an eye.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Dude, if we're going by a pure footrace, Supes would get dusted by the Flash.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: But, why would the Man of Steel agree to a sodding footrace?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Uh, for charity. And Flash would totally win 'cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE:  Oohh vibration, and what would Superman do if he came up against a wall?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Well, no smashing allowed.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: No flying, no smashing... any other restrictions I need to know about? Perhaps we should fit Superman with a pair of Kryptonite ballet slippers...
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: The hell?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Ahh, Charlie, duck!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: This way.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: No, the beacon fell this side of the rise.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: No, there.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: How about we split up? Me and Charlie go that way, you and Jin go round, and we'll meet up at that ridge over there.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Uh, you and Jin. I'll stick with Desmond.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: You said "duck."
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: You shouted "duck." You knew, even before we set off. You knew all this time, didn't you?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Aye.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Well, then why didn't you say anything?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Because if I'd told you the truth, you wouldn't have come!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Oh, and you needed me to come. 'Cause I was part of your vision. You thought that the only way you could get your girl back was if I took an arrow in the head. You would have sacrificed me!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: If the flashes don't happen exactly how I saw them, the picture changes. I was supposed to let you die, Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: What's that supposed to mean?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: It means it's bloody pointless. I keep saving your life, and what good has it done? Its just gonna keep happening again and again, maybe that's the point, eh? Maybe it's a test.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Test?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Like God testing Abraham, except I failed, because I changed what I saw.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: 빨리 와, 찾았어!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: 우리 하는 말 들려요?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Hey! Hey, can you hear me?!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 JIN: Hello! 괜찮아?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: Dude, she's not moving.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: I'm sorry, Penny. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: I was afraid you'd leave without saying goodbye.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: I nearly took this with me.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: If you're not in a hurry, Brother Martin's heading into town in a few hours; he can give you a ride. That is, if you don't mind doing some heavy lifting.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: All 10 cases are ready to go. Desmond there is just getting the last one.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 PENNY: Thank you, and my father sent the check in advance.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: Please thank him for his generous donation. Always a pleasure to see you.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 MONK: Goodbye Desmond.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 PENNY: I think we should be able to fit it all in the back, and if not, we'll put the rest in the front.  Is that alright?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Absolutely.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: You better drive safe, Miss. This vineyard only makes a limited number of these cases each year.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 PENNY: Is that so?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Aye, it's 'cause the monks are lazy.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Yeah, its easier making grape jelly than wine.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 PENNY: And how do you know so much about monks?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Cause I'm an ex-monk.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 PENNY: Really?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: As of last night. I was fired.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Oh, it wasn't that funny.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 PENNY: I'm sorry, I've never, I... I didn't know monks could be fired.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Oh, they can. You know, I was told under no uncertain terms that the abbey wasn't where I was meant to end up. It's just a... step along a path. You know, God allegedly has bigger plans for me.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 PENNY: Something tells me you don't entirely believe that.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: I suspect that's because I don't.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 PENNY: Well, maybe they're right. I mean, just think, if you hadn't got fired, we wouldn't have met, and then, how could you possibly help me unload these crates in Carlisle?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Did I say I was coming to Carlisle with you?
Lost.Season03.Episode17 PENNY: Not yet.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 PENNY: I mean, of course, if an ex-monk already has plans, then...
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: You know, I don't usually get into cars with strangers.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 PENNY: Well, in that case I'm Penelope.  Penny.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Desmond. Very nice to meet you, Penny.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 HURLEY: She's alive!
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Stand back! Get away from her! I'm here, I'm here, Penny.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 CHARLIE: Just, be careful.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 DESMOND: Just get off, Charlie! Sorry Penny, I'm sorry.
Lost.Season03.Episode17 WOMAN: Desmond...
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN:  Oh.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Good morning, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JACK: Need a hand?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JACK: You know, I came by your tent earlier. Has Jin gone?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Oh. He went off with Charlie, Hurley and Desmond. Did you need him?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JACK: Actually, I was looking for you, wanted to see how you were doing with your pregnancy.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Oh, I'm doing fine. A little tired, but that's normal, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JACK: Sure. Any morning sickness?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Not anymore.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JACK: Any bleeding?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN:  Why are you asking me all these questions, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JACK:  I'm just checking in. I mean, now that I'm back, I just wanted to make sure that you were doing OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Thank you. I'm OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JACK: Great.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 여보세요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 여보? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 진수씨? 어우, 징그럽게... 벌써부터 무슨 여보야. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 이제 유부녀인데 빨리 익숙해져야지. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 자기야, 우리 집에 정말 잘 어울리는 침대보 샀어요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 당신이 좋다면 물론 나도 좋지. 나 지금 집이야, 점심시간에 잠깐 들렀어. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 어, 그래? 집이 엉망이지? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 박스가 장난이 아니네. 하지만 우리 잠자리만큼은 확실하게 끝냈지. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN:  어우, 정말 내가 못살아! 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 나 다시 회사 들어가 봐야 돼. 일찍 들어갈게. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 여보. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 네, 여보? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 정말 정말 사랑해요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 Jin: 나도 사랑해. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 WOMAN: 아가씨 맞지? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 네, 맞아요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 WOMAN: 그렇구나, 축하해. 신랑이 아주 잘 생겼네. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 제가 운이 좋았죠. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 WOMAN: 정말 운이 좋았던 것 같아. 아가씨 아버님이 백자동차 백 회장님 맞지? 굉장한 부잣집 따님이시네. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 전 아빠 사업엔 별 관심 없어요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 WOMAN: 신랑의 부모에 대해서는 아무 것도 적은 게 없잖아. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 그 사람 부모님은 돌아가셨어요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 WOMAN: 그래? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 누구시죠? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 WOMAN: 잘못하면 신랑의 배경이 폭로가 될수 있잖아. 우리나라 제일의 권력의 딸이 하찮은 어부 자식과 결혼한다는 사실이 알려진다면... 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN:  상관 없어요. 전 이미 그 사람 아버님이 어부라는 것도 알고 있어요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 WOMAN: 그래? 그럼 몸 팔던 여자의 아들이라는 것도 알고 있어? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 뭐라구요! 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 WOMAN:  3일 후에 5시에 여기서 보지. 나올 때 달러 10만 불 준비해 가지고 와. 정말 사랑한다면 내 요구 조건을 들어줘야 진실을 감출 수 있을 걸? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: Who is she?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: I've no idea.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: She seems to know you, dude, she just said your name.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: I've never seen her before in my life.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: She's waking up.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 PARACHUTIST: ¡Estoy muriendo, estoy muriendo!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: She's trying to talk. We should get her some water.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND:  Give me a hand.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 PARACHUTIST: ¡Estoy muriendo, estoy muriendo! 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: What's she saying?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Don't know.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: It's Spanish, dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Wait, you understand her then?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 PARACHUTIST: ¡Estoy muriendo, estoy muriendo! 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: She says she's dying.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Oh god!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: It's a branch. She must have hit it on the way down.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Right, get her pack! We haven't got much in this first-aid kit. See if there's anything we can use in there.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: What if this is a rescue? What if she came for us? Wha... I mean, is she gonna be OK? We can't let her...
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND:  Just go and start looking!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: We get Jack. Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: We have to get her to Jack as soon as possible. She could be our way off the Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: No, if we move her, it'll make it worse.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: Well, we just let her bleed to death?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: No, we... we need to bring Jack here.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: It's an eight-hour walk, one way!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Then I'll run.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: You out of your mind? It's not safe. It's gonna be dark soon, who knows who's out in this jungle. In case you haven't forgotten, there are people on this Island trying to kill us.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Nobody knows we're here!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: Oops.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 짠! 당신 좋아하는 찌개 사왔어. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 고마워요. 이 박스만 정리하구요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 그냥 두고 빨리 먹자. 그건 나중에 하면 되잖아. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 이 사진, 저 쪽 테이블 위에 올려놓을까? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 사모님이 알아서 하시죠. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 내 평생 학사모를 써도 이렇게 섹시한 여자는 처음이야. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN:  왜 당신 가족 사진은 하나도 없어요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 어, 내가 어렸을 때 우리 집에는 카메라가 없었어. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 한 장도 없다구? 그래도... 아버님 유품이나 편지 한 장도 없다구? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 아버진 내가 군대에 있을 때 돌아가셨어. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 당신이 16살 때 아버님이 돌아가셨다고 하지 않았어요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 무슨 소리야? 군대에 있을 때 돌아가셨다니까? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 아니 지난번에 당신이... 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN:  당신이 잘못 들었겠지! 근데 그건 왜 자꾸 묻는데? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 그냥... 아니에요. 미안해요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 식기 전에 빨리 먹자. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: How's this?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 KATE: That's perfect. Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: What do you think happened to Jack? While he was with the Others. Since he's been back, he seems different.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 KATE: He says that he was pretty much a prisoner, and the only reason why he cooperated was 'cause he thought they'd let him off the Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Do you believe him?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 KATE:  Why wouldn't I?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: He came to me. Asking about my pregnancy.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 KATE: Well, what, would that have anything to do with—
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: What if... What if the Others want my baby? He's been there alone for over a week. How do we know he isn't working with them?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 KATE: He's not working with them.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Do you know something, Kate?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 KATE: It's Juliet. She was their doctor, their... their fertility doctor studying pregnant women, and... when Claire was sick, she told me and Jack... the reason the Others wanted her baby was for research.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 KATE: Sun, wait, you don't have to do this.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Go away, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: I want to know about your research.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 KATE: Sun...
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: What happens to pregnant women?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: You're pregnant? Are you sure? How do you know?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: I asked you a question — everyone else might be alright with you washing your clothes and eating our food, but I want to know what's going on. I want answers. What are you people doing? Why are you taking children? What happens to pregnant women on this Island? What happens to—
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: They die. They all die.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 KATE: Sun, come on, let's go.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 PARACHUTIST: 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: What's she saying?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: Chinese. Not Korean.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: Maybe we should just pull it out.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: No, you'll just make it worse.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: Have you forgotten what's at stake here? Or is this just another one of your flashes — whose getting an arrow in the neck this time?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Lest you forget, she said my bloody name! She had a photo of me and my girlfriend. Do I understand?! I understand better than the lot of you!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: Hey, guys, chill.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: We've wasted enough time already.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: You're not leaving us.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Just get out of my way, Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Hey, Jin!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: Jin!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Jin!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Who are you?  I said, who are you?!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: He's the guy who shot Sayid. Kate told us he lived out in that station Locke blew up. He's an Other.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: I thought Locke killed that guy with the electro-fence thingy.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: You've got five seconds to talk, or I fire this gun brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: That's a flare gun.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: And how do you think it'll feel? Taking a flare to the chest at this range.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: As your friend pointed out, I already died once this week.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 PARACHUTIST: 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: You understand her.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: She's speaking Italian. She said she's dying, she needs help. I was a Soviet Army field medic, I can offer you my services.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: Wait, what are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: I'm saving her.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: This branch has punctured her lung. It's filling with blood. If it is not ventilated soon, she's going to die.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Well, do it. Help her.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: If I fix her, you must let me walk away as if I never came upon you.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND:  What you need?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 혹시, 권 선생님이세요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. KWON: 그렇소만... 선 맞지? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 감사합니다. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. KWON: 그래... 결혼식은 잘 치렀겠지? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 네, 멋있었어요. 제 생애 가장 행복한 날이었거든요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. KWON: 그래, 그건 그놈도 그랬을거다. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 아버님. 왜 저희 결혼식에는 오시지 않으셨어요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. KWON: 그놈이 나에 대해서 뭐라고 하던? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 그 사람은... 아버님이 돌아가셨다고... 왜요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. KWON: 자신의 과거가 부끄럽고 창피해서... 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 그래서 아버님은 진수 씨가 어렸을 때 어머니가 돌아가셨다고 말씀하신 거에요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. KWON: 그 놈 애미... 그 여잔 남자가 많았어. 그 놈을 낳고 바로 떠나버려서 혼자서 내가 그 놈을 키웠어. 내가 그 놈의 애비인지도 확실치 않아. 그렇지만... 그 핏덩이를 누가 키우겠어? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. KWON: 아가야... 정말 이쁘구나. 내 아들이 사랑하는 여자를 만나게 되어 정말 기쁘구나. 진수에게는 날 만났다거나 지 애미가 살아있다는 말은 절대 하지 않았으면 한다. 절대로... 이 늙은이를 봐서라도, 이 사실로 그 녀석의 자존심이 다치지 않았으면 해. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Be quiet. Don't move. You want me to help you and your baby, I have answers to your questions, but you have to come with me right now. Just you and me. Nobody else.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: If what you said was true, that means I'm already dead. Why should I go anywhere with you?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Because there may be a hope for you yet.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Where are we going?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: There's a medical station near here, they have an ultrasound machine.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Claire and Kate told me about that place. It was abandoned, they found nothing there.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Well, that's because they didn't know where to look.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: What are you going to do to me?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: I'm gonna look at your baby and determine the DOC. Erm, date of conception. The ultrasound will tell me when you got pregnant, give or take a day. If you got pregnant off the Island then you and your baby will probably be OK, but if you got pregnant here... we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. When was the last time you and your husband had sex?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: I would rather not talk about that.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Look, I know that it's personal, but if I know when, then I...
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN:  Isn't that what the machine will do?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Then let's keep walking.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 BUSINESSMAN: 위조된 운송 허가증을 저희가 아직 얻지 못했습니다, 회장님.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. PAIK: 한소 재단에서 우리 측에서 장비를 제공하지 않았다고 난리 났다는데?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SECRETARY: 회장님, 따님이 오셨습니다. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 BUSINESSMAN 1: 축하합니다. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 감사합니다. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 BUSINESSMAN 2: 행복하게 사시길 바랍니다. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. PAIK: 갑자기 이 아빠를 찾아온 용건이 뭘까? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 부탁이 있어요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. PAIK: 우리 공주님, 무슨 부탁이 있으실까? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 저... 저 필요한게...   저 10만 불이 필요해요.  
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. PAIK: 어디다 쓰려고? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 그건 말씀드릴 수가 없어요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. PAIK: 그렇다면 내가 무엇 때문에 너에게 그 돈을 줘야 하지? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 전 지난 27년 동안... 아빠가 무슨 일을 하시는지도 알면서도 모른 척 해왔어요. 아빠 뜻에 어긋나는 행동을 한 적도, 생각해 본 적도 없어요. 더구나 싫은 내색은 한 번도 하지 않았구요. 저 앞으로도 계속 그럴 거에요, 물론 아빠가 제 부탁을 들어주신다는 조건 하에... 이유는 묻지 마세요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. PAIK: 이유는 묻지 말라고? 이 세상이 니가 생각하는 것처럼 그렇게 호락호락한 줄 알아? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 제가 사랑하는 사람의 자존심을 지키기 위해서에요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. PAIK: 네 남편 때문에 그러는구만. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MR. PAIK: 그 놈 때문이라면 이 돈은 그 놈이 앞으로 갚아야 할 빚이야. 공장장 일은 그만두고 이제부터 내가 시키는 일만 하게 될거다. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: What else do you know about this woman? Did she have anything on her besides the flare gun?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: Just a book, fancy radio phone thingy.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: Does it work?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: Like I'd tell you.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: One of you must help. The rest, clear the way, I need space.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: I'll do it.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: Wipe away as much of the blood as you can.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: We need to evac the air now! Hold her steady. Steady!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Yeah, I heard ya!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Is that... normal?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: Gause! Desmond grabs some material and places it on the wound.]  Tape it, be careful. Covering needs to be hollow, the wound needs to breathe.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 PARACHUTIST:   Eu não estou só... Eu não estou só. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: What did she say?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: Thank you. She said thank you for helping me.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: It's right down here.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Why are you doing this?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Helping me.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET:  Once upon a time, I told women that they were pregnant, and their faces... it was the best news they ever got in their entire life. Then I came here. I've lost... nine patients in the last three years. I'm helping you because I want to tell you that you and your husband got pregnant before you came here. I'm helping you because I wanna give good news again.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: I slept with another man.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Oh.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Before we got to the Island. Jin and I, we were having trouble, we weren't... And I had a friend. It was a mistake.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: We all make mistakes.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Which way?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Will you help me move this forward?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Why is this room hidden?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Don't worry about it.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: What is this place? Tell me.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: It's where we brought the women to die.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: She's fine. Keep the wound as clean as you can, she should be better in a day.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: A day? Her lung was punctured.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: On this Island, the wounds are a bit different. Maybe a day and a half. I did as I promised. She will live.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: You can't seriously be considering letting him go.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Just go.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: Are you kidding? He's one of them!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: So what would you have me do Charlie? We gotta make a stretcher and carry her. How we gonna do that and bring a prisoner?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: We need some rope, I'll take responsibility.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: Phone. Phone!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: No, Jin.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: Phone.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Jin, it's all right!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: No, let him, Desmond!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Jin! Come back here!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: Oi! Let him!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Jin, it's all right, Jin!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Jin, let him go! Jin, let go!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: Phone!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: You stole this.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL: How could you respect me if I didn't try?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: How about I take your other eye? Would you respect that?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 MIKHAIL:  Sorry, what?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Charlie, don't, Charlie!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: No!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: Charlie, let him go!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: This is a mistake! We can't keep letting these people go!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: We gave him our word!  Go on, get out of here.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: The baby isn't Jin's. We tried to have a baby back in Korea and couldn't. And the doctor... he told me Jin was infertile.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: And then you came here.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Did you know that the average male sperm count is between sixty and eighty million? But on the Island, it's five times that. We call that good odds. You ready?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: OK, now lift your shirt up a little.  It's cold.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Will I see the baby?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Maybe, it's your first trimester, so it's a little iffy. If you don't see a heartbeat, don't worry about it, it's just early.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: How does it work?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Well, I take a measurement of the foetus, and that will tell us when your baby was conceived, and then we'll know who.  You OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: I lose either way. If I'm going to live, that means the baby's not Jin's.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Do you still want to do this?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: OK, moment of truth.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 여보? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 여보? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 오늘 회사에 왔다면서? 왜 나한테는 들르지 않았어? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 당신이 바쁠 것 같아서요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 아무리 바빠도 당신 볼 시간은 있지. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 다음엔 꼭 들를게요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 우편물 온거 없어? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 아, 미안. 깜빡했네. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 열쇠는 어디 있어? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 거실에 있는 내 가방 안에요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 진수 씨! 잠깐만요! 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 이거 무슨 돈이야? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 그거... 아빠가 주신 거에요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 뭐 때문에? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 가구도 사야 되구... 우리 신혼여행도 가야 되잖아. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 그 정도는 내가 할 수 있잖아. 신혼여행... 가구 같은 거는 시간이 좀 걸리겠지만 열심히 일해서 내가 다 해줄게. 무슨 일이 있어도 당신은 내가 책임질거야. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 알아요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 드려. 그렇지 않아도 아버님에게 너무 많은 신세를 졌는데, 더 이상 그러고 싶지 않아. 부탁해. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 진수 씨... 사랑해요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: 정말? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 정말. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: There it is. There's your baby. Can you see?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: I can see it. Is it a boy or a girl?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Oh, it's... it's a little early. But, um, do you see that little flutter? That's the heart beating. It's very strong, it's very healthy. OK, you crashed here ninety days ago. The baby was conceived about eight weeks ago, so around fifty-three days. You got pregnant on the Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: I'm sorry, I am so sorry Sun. I will do everything that I can...
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN:  It's Jin's!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 WOMAN: 난 안 나타나는 줄 알았어. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 진수 씨 어머니라고 왜 말씀하지 않으셨어요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 WOMAN: 낳기만 했지 내가 그 놈 애미라고 말할 순 없잖아. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: 저희 집이 어떤 집안이라는 거 잘 알고 계시죠? 내 남편은 당신이 죽은 걸로 알고 있어. 다음엔 당신에게 무슨 일이 일어날지 나도 장담 못해. 
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: So how long do I have?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Most of the women made it into the middle of their second trimester, nobody made it to their third.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: That gives me two months. I am... very happy the baby's Jin's. You gave me good news, Juliet.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: It was my pleasure, Sun. I'm gonna go back inside and make sure that I didn't miss anything. I don't wanna take the chance that we didn't cover our tracks. Do you wanna wait out here?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 SUN: All right.  Juliet. Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET: Ben, it's six AM on Saturday morning. Kwon is pregnant, the fetus is healthy and was conceived on-Island with husband. He was sterile before they got here. I'm still working on getting samples from the other women. I should have Austen's soon. I'll report back when I know more.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JULIET:  I hate you.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: You can't trust 'em, you know.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: What's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: The Others. The one you let go. He'll be back tomorrow with five of his mates. Should have killed him.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 JIN: Charlie.  Tight.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: Oh, OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 DESMOND: You know brother, by my count, you've killed more of them than they've killed of you.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 CHARLIE: They started it. You know, just 'cause one comes traipsing back with Jack and Kate doesn't mean that we can trust 'em now.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY:  Mom?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 PARACHUTIST: Where am I?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: Take it easy, you just had a giant branch...
Lost.Season03.Episode18 PARACHUTIST:  Where am I?!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: I dunno. You're on an Island. Are you here to rescue us? Are there more of you? Can you make your phone work?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 PARACHUTIST: Who are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: Hugo Reyes. I crashed here on Oceanic Flight 815. A bunch of us survived. Is that why you're here? Were you looking for us?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 PARACHUTIST: 815? Flight 815? The one from Sydney?
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: Yeah!
Lost.Season03.Episode18 PARACHUTIST: No, that's not possible.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: Yeah, I know. It wasn't easy, but we found food, and a hatch...
Lost.Season03.Episode18 PARACHUTIST:  No. No, Flight 815 they, they found the plane. There were no survivors. They were all dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode18 HURLEY: What?!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Save your breath. Nobody's gonna hear you.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Dad? What is this?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: You tell me. You brought him here.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: I didn't bring him here.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: I'd be careful about getting too close to him, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Where did you find him? Why did you bring him here?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: I already said. We didn't.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: You want me to ask him how he got here?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Be my guest.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Tom!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: I warned you, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: Don't you know, John? Don't you know where we are?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE:  What did he mean?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: I'm afraid we don't have time to deal with that right now, John. We're leaving first thing in the morning, all of us.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Where are you going?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: We're going to a new place. Well, an old place, actually. Would you like to come with us?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE:  Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Good. We're holding Kate a few buildings over from here, maybe you'd like to say goodbye.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Hey, where you going?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: I can't sleep if I'm not in my own tent.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Fine, let's go to your tent.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE:  Um... its nothing personal, it's just... old habits, you know?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Fine, scram.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: You want me to walk you home?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: It's five tents, I think I'll make it.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Sure? I gotta pee anyway.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: That is so romantic.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: What the hell are y'all doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 HURLEY: What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Going to take a leak.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 HURLEY: Yeah well, so were we.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Well alrightey then.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Hello, James.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Wanna zip your pants up?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: The hell are you doing here?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Looking for you, actually.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: OK Tarzan, so now that you're back from your blow-up-everything-that-could-get-us-off-the-Island tour, how 'bout you tell me why you joined up with the damn enemy?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: I didn't join them. I infiltrated them.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER:  You're undercover with the Others.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: That's right.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: But how 'bout you give me one reason to believe that?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Because a few hours ago I snuck into Ben's tent and kidnapped him. I tied him up, dragged him off into the jungle.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: And you came all the way back here to tell me this because...?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Because this is the same man who tortured you, beat you, humiliated you. And I want you to kill him.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: You want him dead, you kill him.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: I'm not a murderer.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Neither am I!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: 'Cept for the man you killed in Sydney. They got files on us, James. All of us.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Yeah well, their file's got their facts wrong.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Then I made a mistake coming to you. Please don't tell anyone that I was here.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Hey, stop.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: I said stop!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Dammit! Wait up.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: There. That ought to do it.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 CINDY: Thanks. That would have taken me hours to do myself.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Glad I could help.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 CINDY: Don't mind them. They're all just excited you're here.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Excited?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 CINDY: We've been waiting for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 TOM: John. You got a minute?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 TOM: Ben's asking for ya.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JULIET:  Ben, it's 6 a.m. on Saturday morning. Kwon is pregnant, the fetus is healthy and was conceived on-Island with her husband; he was sterile before they got here...
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Hello, John. Thanks for coming.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE:  What's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Juliet is gathering information for us at your former camp. She's determining if any of the women are pregnant. Then we're gonna go in and... take them.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Take them?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: This is not the first time we've done this, John. Trust me, no one will get hurt.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Could you pass me that please?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: I believe I have you to thank for this, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Me?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: A week ago I couldn't move my toes. But the minute you showed up, I started to feel pins and needles. And this is only the beginning, John. I can't wait to show you what this Island can do. But unfortunately, you're not ready, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Well er, no, I'm ready.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: No, John, you're not. You're still crippled by the memories of the man you used to be before you came to this Island. And you'll never be free until you release the hold that your father has over you. Why do you think you brought him here?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE:  Oh oh oh, the, magic box, OK Ben, how about you show me—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: The magic box is a metaphor, John. I can't show you anything until you can show me that you're ready and willing to be one of us. When people join us here on this Island, they need to make a gesture of free will, of commitment. That's why you're gonna have to kill your father.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK: Hey. When'd you get back?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 CHARLIE: Jack. Hey. Uh, last night. Well, early this morning.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK: So, camping huh? What were you guys doing out there?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 CHARLIE: We figured we'd, er, explore a bit. You know, see what was further down the beach. Male bonding.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK: Well, next time you go out, sign me up.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 CHARLIE: Yeah, next time. Sure.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 CHARLIE: Thanks, Jin.  We have to tell Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 HURLEY: Yeah, I mean shouldn't he check out her wound?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 DESMOND: Can you give me your word that Jack can be trusted? Now, he spent 10 days with those people and then nothing happened to him? And that woman he's spending all his time with—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 CHARLIE: Juliet?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 DESMOND: Aye, Juliet. Two weeks ago she had your friends in cages. Naomi... I mean, you heard everything that she said. If we keep her safe, she's our way off this Island. So given that, do you trust Jack? Or don't you?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 DESMOND: Right. So you better bring us someone we can trust.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: You should have put some shoes on.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Ya think? So what else is in it?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: In what?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: The file they got on me.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Not much. That your parents died when you were very young. But it doesn't say why your father shot your mother or why he turned the gun on himself.  That must have been hard for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: What else?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: High school transcripts. Uh, criminal record. All the con jobs you were arrested for. I guess that's why you use an alias, huh? Why did you choose the name Sawyer—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: How stupid do you think I am, huh?! I've already been conned by Ben once. Maybe you heard about it, bunny with a number painted on it. Think I'm just gonna follow you through the jungle—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: James, please, you have to, you have to trust me...
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Where are you taking me? Tell me the truth! What do you want from me?!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: I'm bringing you there to do exactly what I said. I need you to kill Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Why did you come back to get me?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: I had to.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Why me?! Why won't you do it yourself?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: James, please!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Don't call me James! Why won't you do it yourself?!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Because I can't! I can't!!! I can't do it!  That's why I came back for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Get up.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: I'll go to wherever you got him, but then we're bringing him back to our camp. I ain't killing nobody, you understand me?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Yeah. I understand. But you'll change your mind. When you hear what he has to say. You'll change your mind.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 HURLEY: Hey dude.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: Hello Hurley.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 HURLEY: Can you keep a secret?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID:  You've already spoken to her?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 CHARLIE: Yeah. You're gonna wanna hear it for yourself.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: And you haven't told Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 CHARLIE: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: Good.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID:  My name's Sayid Jarrah. I understand your helicopter crashed onto the Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 NAOMI: Actually, it crashed in the water.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: What's your name?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 NAOMI: Naomi. Naomi Dorrit.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: Naomi, from where exactly did you take off?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 NAOMI: A ship. Freighter. About eighty nautical miles west of here. We're part of a search-and-recovery team.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: You told my friends the wreckage of Flight 815 was discovered. Did you mean the partial wreckage?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 NAOMI: No. They found the entire plane off the coast of Bali. In an ocean trench four miles deep. They sent down cameras in these little robots to survey the wreck. The bodies were all there.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: Well, obviously we're not dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 NAOMI: Obviously.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: So if you weren't looking for us, then who were you looking for?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 NAOMI:  Him.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: Desmond?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 NAOMI: My company was hired by a woman named Penelope Widmore. I don't know why, I never met her. She gave us a set of coordinates. We'd be conducting a differential GPS grid search ever since.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: You knew about the Island?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 NAOMI: Island? We were given coordinates in the middle of the bloody ocean. We thought it was a fool's errand. 'Til three days ago. I was flying back for the ship when all of a sudden the clouds cleared and I saw land. The instruments started spinning, I realized I was going down, so... I grabbed my chute and I bailed.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID:  Did you actually see her helicopter?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 DESMOND: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 NAOMI: You think I'm lying, mate?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: And I take it you have no means whatsoever of communicating with that freighter of yours?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 NAOMI: What was your name? Sayid?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 NAOMI: Remind me not to rescue you, Sayid.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: So Ben. You said I'd kill him when I heard what he's got to say.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: That's right.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Well, you wanna give me a head's up?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: It's not really my place to tell you.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Look, what you read in that file, about the guy in Sydney. I thought he was someone else. I made a mistake; I didn't mean to kill him.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Well, who'd you mean to kill?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Are we almost there?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Almost.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Wake up, John. It's time.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: I know it won't be easy. But the quicker the better.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: You're kidding me, right? You expect him to kill me?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: John. The hesitation that you're feeling is just the part of you that still feels like he has a perfectly good explanation for stealing your kidney. Throwing you out of an eight-story window. Don't you want to be free from him?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: The hesitation he's feeling is because he is a spineless—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Shut up!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: I... I gotta think.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Don't think, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER:  You're wasting your time, bug-eye. Me and him have been through all this. All he wants is his daddy—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Shut up! I said shut up!!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: You really haven't figured it out yet, have you?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Let go of him, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Why are you doing this to me?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: You're doing this to yourself. As long as he's still breathing, you'll still be that same sad pathetic little man that was kicked off his walkabout tour because you couldn't walk.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: I'll be here the rest of the week, John, if you change your mind--
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: I'm sorry. He's not who we thought he was.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Son of a...
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Nice place you got here, Locke.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Ben's inside in the brig. You ready?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Yeah I'm ready.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER:  Friends of yours?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: It's an old slaving ship. Mid-19th century. My guess is they captured the slaves and brought 'em here to try and mine the Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: What's in the boxes?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: That'd be dynamite.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Son of a bitch. You really kidnapped the little bastard.  We ain't killing him, Locke.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Whatever you say, James.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Well well well.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Hey, hey! What are you doing?! Open the damn door!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Shut up! Open up!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: I said shut up!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Who the hell are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 HURLEY: So is that like a radio?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: It's like a radio, yes. But I've never seen equipment this sophisticated.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 HURLEY: You can still make it work, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: I hope so.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 HURLEY: And what about the other part? The part about they found the plane and we were all dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: One thing at a time.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: There's not a single audible channel. Whatever that interference is, it's blocking our ability to send out our own transmission. If we—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: What's that? Is that a radio? Where'd you get it?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 HURLEY: Uh, the luggage.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: What? You just found a radio in the luggage?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAYID: Kate, if I explain, I want you to keep this very quiet.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: Keep what very quiet?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Locke! Open this damn door! Open it up! I can hear you, you bald bastard!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Rousseau.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 ROUSSEAU: Locke.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: What brings you to the Black Rock?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 ROUSSEAU: Dynamite. And you?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER:  Open this door! Open up!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Crates are right over there.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER:  Open this damn door!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Be careful, its unstable.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Locke! LOCKE!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 RICHARD: It's beautiful, isn't it? No matter how much time you spend on the Island, you just never get tired of this view. We haven't been formally introduced. I'm Richard.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 RICHARD: You mind if I, join you here?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Nah, sure.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 RICHARD: He wanted to embarrass you.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 RICHARD: Ben knew you weren't gonna kill your own father. He put you in front of everyone in our camp just so they could all watch you fail.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 RICHARD: 'Cause when word got back here that there was a man with a broken spine on the plane who could suddenly walk again, well, people here began to get very excited because that, that could only happen to someone who was extremely special. But Ben doesn't want anyone to think you're special, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: And why are you telling me this?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 RICHARD: Ben has been wasting our time with novelties like fertility problems. We're looking for someone to remind us that we're here for more important reasons.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: What do you want from me?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 RICHARD: I want for you to find your purpose. And to do that, your father has to go, John. And since you're not gonna do it, I'm gonna suggest someone else.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Sawyer! Why would Sawyer kill my father? He doesn't even know him.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 RICHARD:  Keep reading.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Open this damn door! Son of a bitch!!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: I'm pointing my gun at you John-boy. You got three seconds to open this door.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: You're not gonna shoot anyone, James.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: One!  Two!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: If there were any bullets in that gun, why would you hold a knife to my throat?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Ah! Son of a bitch!!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: Guess I didn't raise no dummies.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: The hell's that mean?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: It means that bald-headed bastard outside the door is my son.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Come again?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: My son. As in I'm his father. You do speak English?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: You're his... How did you get here, to the Island?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: Island? OK. I'm driving down I-10 through Tallahassee when bam, somebody slams into the back of my car. I go right into the divider at 70 miles an hour. The next thing I know, the paramedics are strapping me to a gurney, stuffing me into the back of an ambulance, and one of them actually smiles at me as he pops the IV in my arm. And then, nothing. Just, black. And the next thing I know I wake up in a dark room tied up, gag in my mouth, and when the door opens, I'm looking up at the same man I threw out a window, John Locke. My dead son.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: And he's dead 'cause you threw him out a window?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: No, he survived that. But it paralyzed him, permanently. He's dead because the plane he was flying on crashed in the Pacific.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Well, I got bad news for ya, pops, 'cause I was on that plane with your son. He sure as hell wasn't crippled. And we didn't crash in the Pacific, we crashed here on this Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: You sure it's an Island?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Well, what else is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: A little hot for heaven, isn't it?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER:  Oh, OK, so we're dead?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: They found your plane on the bottom of the ocean. One minute I'm in a car wreck, and the next minute I'm in a pirate ship in the middle of the jungle. If this isn't hell, friend, then where are we?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Why did you throw Locke out a window?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: He was becoming a nuisance. I conned him into giving me one of his kidneys. He never got over it.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER:  Conned?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: Yes sir, conned.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: What's your name?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: Hmm?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Your name.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: A conman goes by many names, friend. I've been Alan Seward, Anthony Cooper, Ted MacLaren, Tom Sawyer, Louis Jackson, Paul—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Tom Sawyer.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: I was young and Huck Finn was taken. And the ladies loved that one. Made me charming.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Well, how about that.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: How about what?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Sawyer's my name, too.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Ben. What's going on?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: We're moving.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Moving? Where are we going?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: We are not going anywhere, John. You are going to stay behind. You both are going to stay behind.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: What? You're not taking him?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN:  He's your mess, John. Why would we clean it up?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Ben! If you're trying to put me in my place, or embarrass me—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Where would you get a ridiculous idea like that?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Well, you can't leave me. After everything—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Don't tell me what I can't do, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: But I thought I was... special.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 BEN: Well, everyone makes mistakes. We're leaving now. We'll leave a trail, one you can track. And John, unless you're carrying your father's body on your back, don't bother.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: What's the matter with you?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: You ever been to Jasper, Alabama?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Have you or haven't you?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: Yeah, I've been to Jasper. Don't tell me I'm your daddy...
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: No. You killed my daddy.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Read it.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: "Dear Mr Sawyer." What is this?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Just read it.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: "You don't know who I am, but I know who you are. And I know what you done. You had sex with my mother, and then you stole my dad's money all away, so he got angry and he killed my mother, and then he killed himself"  blah blah blah blah. So what? Is this supposed to be you, you wrote this letter? Hey, wait a second. Did you take my name because you were on some kind of revenge kick?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Keep reading.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: Easy, easy, don't get all worked up. Look, I ran that con two dozen times. If your mother was one of the—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Mary. Her name was Mary.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: Mary from Jasper, Alabama. Yeah, I remember her. She practically begged me to take her thirty-eight thousand dollars and to rescue her from her sorry little life.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: You finish the letter.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: Look, I only took her money. It ain't my fault your dad overreacted. If he pulled the old murder suicide, then I'm sure he's down here somewhere. Er, maybe you could take this up with him—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: FINISH IT!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 COOPER: OK. OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: You wanna go to hell?! You wanna go to hell?!!
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK: You missing those cheeseburgers yet?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JULIET: Only every second.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: I need to talk to you.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK: OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: In private.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JULIET: No problem.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK:  Anything you wanna say to me, you can say in front of her.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: Not this.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JULIET: It's OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK: No no no no, you can stay.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: Yeah, you know what, you should stay. Seems only fair considering she's the reason that no one wants to tell you that there's a woman in Hurley's tent who parachuted onto the Island yesterday.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: A woman. She jumped from her chopper before it crashed. She says that the boat that she took off from is about 80 miles off the coast and that if she can find a way to contact it, we'll all be rescued.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK: Why didn't anyone tell me this?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: I already told you, because they don't trust you.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK:  How?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: How what?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK: How is she supposed to contact her boat?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: Did you hear what I just said? Hurley, Charlie, Sayid, your friends are afraid to...
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK: Kate! How?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: She had a phone radio thing, Sayid's trying to get it to work.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JULIET: We should tell her.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 KATE: Tell me what?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JULIET: We should tell her.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 JACK:  Not yet.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: You can go back now.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Why did you do this?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: He ruined my life. And he ruined yours. And he had it coming.  Juliet is a mole.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: She's working for Ben. He sent her back to find out which of our women were pregnant. Three days from now, there's gonna be a raid on the beach and they're gonna take them. They say they don't want anyone to get hurt.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Why are you telling me this?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: So you can warn the camp.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: You warn the camp.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: I'm not going back.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: You're going back undercover?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: No, I was never undercover, James. I'm on my own journey now.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Even if Juliet is a mole, they ain't gonna believe me, I've been saying that since she showed up—
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: They'll believe you now.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: Hey. Is it true?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Is what true?
Lost.Season03.Episode19 SAWYER: That he threw you out a window. That you were a cripple.
Lost.Season03.Episode19 LOCKE: Not anymore.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MAN: Come on! Dammit, push!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 WOMAN:  Something's wrong! I can't...oh...
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MAN: Emily! You can do this! Now push, come on! Come on, baby. You can do it, now come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MAN: Come on, there you go. Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MAN: It's a boy! You did it.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 EMILY: It hurts.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MAN: Oh...
Lost.Season03.Episode20 EMILY: Roger, it hurts.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Emily, no one knows we're out here. We gotta get back, okay, honey? Can you hold on to the baby? Emily! Can you hold the baby? Hold him tight.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Help. Help! Help!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Oh my God, help me.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MALE DRIVER: Hey, what happened, man?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: We were hiking. She went into labor and she wasn't due yet. She's bleeding.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MALE DRIVER: Okay, okay, look, we'll put her in the car, okay? Let me get you to the hospital.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Oh, okay, okay, honey.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MALE DRIVER: Okay, it's all right.  Let's keep her warm, all right? How's the baby?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Fine, I guess—I don't know.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 EMILY: Roger? Roger.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: I'm right here.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 EMILY: Call him Benjamin.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Stay with me. Stay with me. Emily! Emily! Emily! Oh God, no!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: What you got there?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: It's a birthday present. Mine just happens to be today. You do remember birthdays, don't you Richard?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: So do you want me to bring the tape back to Juliet?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN:  What?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: The tape with your instructions for Juliet, do you want me to bring it back to the medical station?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN:  I recorded it yesterday, before we left. I thought you already took it!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Where's Tom? Tom! Have you seen my recorder?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: You said that if I killed my father, you'd tell me everything I wanted to know about the Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: So why don't you start at the beginning?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I know I promised to tell you everything, John, and I wish it was as simple as me taking out a dusty old book and opening it up.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: But it's not that simple.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: How about you just tell me?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: You probably think I'm the leader of this little community, but that's not entirely true. We all answer to someone, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: And whom might that be?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: His name is Jacob.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Okay, then. Take me to Jacob.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I can't do that.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Where are you going?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Hell, Ben, if you don't wanna take me, maybe someone else will. I'll just go and ask Richard...
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Why would Richard take you? He doesn't know where Jacob is.  He doesn't talk to Jacob...
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Well, who talks to him?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I do.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: So you're the only one who talks to him?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: That's right!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: And no one else knows where he is?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I was born here on this Island. I'm one of the last that was. Most of these people you see—I brought them here. So Jacob talks to me, John. He tells me what to do, trusts me.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: And no one else has ever seen him?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: That's right.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: How convenient. You know what I think, Ben? I think there is no Jacob. I think your people are idiots if they believe you take orders from someone else. You are the man behind the curtain, the Wizard of Oz. And you're a liar.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: And what might you base that theory on, John?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Because if you were telling the truth, your hand wouldn't be shaking.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 WOMAN: Namaste!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 WOMAN: Namaste!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MALE DRIVER: Hey, welcome to the Island, man! Namaste.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Namaste, yeah!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MALE DRIVER: So, what do ya think?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Wow, this is...some place. Thanks again for the opportunity, Mr. Goodspeed.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MR. GOODSPEED: Horace! Please.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Horace.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 HORACE: And this must be Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Yeah.  Mr. Goodspeed was there the day you were born.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 HORACE: Yes, I was.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: He's doing us a big favor here. Gave your old man a job.  Ah, he don't say much.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 HORACE: That's okay. I bet he will when he has something to say. Right, Ben? Hey, you hungry, kiddo? Huh, huh? Great. Well, I'll tell you what.  After you're done processing, we'll have some lunch.  How's that sound?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Yeah, thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 HORACE: You're gonna love it here.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MARVIN: Welcome to the Island. For your own comfort and safety, we ask that you stay within the confines of your new living quarters. Our Barracks are surrounded by a high frequency sonar fence, to protect us from the Island's abundant and diverse wildlife. You are now a member of the DHARMA Initiative...
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER:  What kind of wildlife you think this fence is protecting us from?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MAN: Roger Linus? Roger Linus?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MARVIN: ...Every morning you will be given a new code which will allow you to cross outside the fences if you so desire... there are properties on this Island that exist nowhere else on Earth. Our mission is to study these properties for the betterment of mankind and advancement of world peace. Most of you will be working on the mainland. Should you be assigned zoological studies, the Pala Ferry will carry you to and from the Hydra 3 times a day...
Lost.Season03.Episode20 GIRL: Hey. You're new, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 GIRL: I'm Annie. Want one?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ANNIE: We can have as many as we want.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Work man? What is this? Work man? I'm a janitor?!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 OPAL: I'm sorry, Mr. Linus.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Goodspeed told me you people were doing experiments, changing the world. I didn't come here to clean up after ya!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 OPAL: Look, if anything else opens up, you can feel free to apply for it.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER:  Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 CHARLIE:  I think he'll grow out of it.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 CLAIRE: You don't think it's too big?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 HURLEY: Dude, you know what I'm saying?  It can't be worse than haggis.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 DESMOND: Oh I dunno, I could murder some haggis right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAWYER: Hey! Sayid!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: What happened to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAWYER: I was with Locke.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: Well, where is he?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAWYER: He went back.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: Back where?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAWYER: With them. Don't ask me where the hell it is, 'cause it don't matter right now. What does matter , is this.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MIKHAIL: Where is Ben?! Where is he?!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I thought you were dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MIKHAIL: I'm fortunate the pylons were not set to a lethal level.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MIKHAIL: What is he doing here?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: It's all right.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MIKHAIL: He's the one who tried to kill me!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: He's with us now. Where have you been, Mikhail?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MIKHAIL: I encountered several of his people in the jungle. They had an injured woman with them. Apparently, she had just parachuted onto the Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: What?!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MIKHAIL: Her helo crashed into water. She says her ship is approximately 130 clicks to the west of us. She has a radio telephone.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Where is she now?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MIKHAIL: I assume they have taken her back to their camp.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: We'll be visiting their camp day after tomorrow. We'll take care of it then.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MIKHAIL: Day after tomorrow? We have to go now!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Ben's not going anywhere with you.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MIKHAIL: Excuse me?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: He and I are going to see Jacob.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MIKHAIL: Please tell me this isn't true, Benjamin.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN:  I'm sorry, I have to deal with this now, John. Our excursion will have to wait.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 MIKHAIL: Since when do you explain yourself to him? An outsider-
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Tom? Richard?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE:  So when do we leave?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: You know, you didn't have to beat Mikhail senseless to make your point, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Yes, I did.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ALEX:  Locke.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ALEX: I hear you're gonna go see Jacob. You're gonna need this.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE:  Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ALEX:  Happy birthday, Dad.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 OLIVIA: So, once water is added to the bicarbonate, we will get our very own volcanic reaction.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 OLIVIA: Yes?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ANNIE: Is that what happened to the volcano on this Island?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 OLIVIA: Exactly Annie, but that was a long time ago. Okay! Let's get ourselves an eruption.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 OLIVIA: Just add water, and...voilà. Now I know it's not lava, but—
Lost.Season03.Episode20 OLIVIA: Okay, everyone into your positions! That's right, all together. Annie, lock the back door please!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 OLIVIA:  Ben, come on, honey, you gotta move. Ben!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ANNIE: Come on!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ANNIE: Don't worry. It's just the Hostiles. We'll be okay.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 HORACE: Hey, man, heard you ran into a little trouble.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: We're driving back from the Flame and we hear this huge explosion. Next thing I know, there's a siren wailing, and we're driving through the middle of a shootout.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 HORACE: Look, we're having some skirmishes with the natives.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: What do you mean, "natives"?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 HORACE: Well, we're not exactly sure who they are.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER:  Oh, this ain't what I signed up for!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 HORACE: Roger, I did you a favor, man. You were having trouble finding work. And don't forget about Ben—he's getting a quality education here.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: I don't give a damn about his education! If I'm gonna get shot at, I want hazard pay! I want another thirty grand.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 HORACE: Calm down, man.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: And don't try to tell me you don't have it, you hear me?!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: All right, get the hell out of my house!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: I thought I told you to go to bed.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: She's not here.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAWYER: I noticed.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 KATE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: Looking for Juliet.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 KATE: Well, you're not gonna find her in there. She left with Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: Juliet left with Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 KATE: He took off right after I told him about Naomi.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAWYER: Who's Naomi?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: And why would you do that, Kate?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 KATE: Because she's hurt, because he's a doctor, and because he has a right to know.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: Where is he now?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 KATE: I dunno, Sayid.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: Of course you don't.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 KATE: You know, it might be time for you to tell everybody else about Naomi, too.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID:  Play her the tape!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 KATE:  What tape?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Something you should know, John, before we go. Whether or not you think he's the Wizard of Oz, I can assure you that Jacob is very, very real. And we're gonna go see him, and he's not gonna like it. In fact, I have a feeling he's going to be very...angry. And that's why my hand was shaking, because this is not a man you go and see. This is a man who summons you.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Well, I guess there's a first time for everything.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ANNIE: It's us. That's you and that's me. Now we never have to be away from each other. Happy birthday, Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ANNIE: You're welcome.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Wow...  It's your birthday. Sorry I forgot. Kinda hard to celebrate on the day you killed your mom. She was just seven months pregnant.  We went for a hike, but you had to come early. Now, she's gone. And I'm stuck here on this island...with you.  Happy birthday, Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Mom?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 EMILY: Ben, don't!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Mom!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 EMILY: It's not time yet, Benjamin.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Mom!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Let's go, John. John!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 CLAIRE: So, what, the whole world thinks we're dead?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: That's not important right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SUN: Not important?!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 CLAIRE: What do you mean it's not important, Sayid?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 NAOMI: Excuse me. I'm sorry, don't you people want to be rescued?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: We kept her a secret to keep her safe.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 KATE: Safe from what, Sayid?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: Safe from Jack. He spent a week with the Others, and he brought one of them back with him. Here, amongst us. And every time we try to get answers from this woman, he prevents her from giving them.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SUN: But it's Jack! He would never do anything to hurt us. And Juliet? I believe she's a good person.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAWYER: Good person, huh? You basing that on what? Wouldn't involve her taking you to one of their medical stations would it now, Mrs. Kwon?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SUN: How—
Lost.Season03.Episode20 JULIET : Kwon is pregnant, the fetus is healthy and was conceived on-Island with her husband, he was sterile before they got here.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 JIN: 무슨 일이야?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 JULIET : I'm still working on getting samples from the other women. I should have Austen's soon. I'll report back when I know more.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 JACK: Where'd you get that?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: Where have you been, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 JACK: I asked you where you got it.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAWYER: You really think you're in a position to be asking us questions?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 JULIET: Turn the tape over.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAWYER: Stay out of it.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 JULIET: You wanna burn me at the stake, here I am, but first, turn the tape over, press play.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN : Juliet, it's Ben. I'm sending three teams to extract Kwon the night after tomorrow. We won't have time to run Austen's sample, so if you determine that she or anyone else is pregnant, mark their tents, and we'll take them, too. Good luck.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 JULIET:  The night I saw your baby on the ultrasound, I told Jack what they were making me do.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: Why didn't you tell us?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 JACK: Because I hadn't decided what to do about it yet.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 SAYID: "Yet"?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 JACK: I think we've got some catching up to do.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Mom..? Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Whoa. Whoa, hey, hey, whoa, I didn't mean to scare you. Wait, wait! Are you lost? Wait!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Are you one of them?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: One of whom?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: A hostile.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: Do you even know what that word means? What's your name?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: Ben? So you wanna tell me what you're doing in the middle of the jungle all by yourself?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I left home, and...I'm looking for my Mom.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: You think she's out here?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: You wouldn't believe me.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: Try me.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: She's dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: Did she die here, on the Island?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: No. When I was a baby.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: Did you see her, out here, Ben, in the jungle?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: She talked to me.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: What did she say?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: That I couldn't come with her. She said it wasn't time yet.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: You should go home now, your people will be looking for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I don't want to go back there! I hate it there! Take me with you.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: Maybe that can happen, maybe. But if that's what you really want, Ben, if that's what you want, I want you to really think about that. And you're gonna have to be very, very patient.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: We're here.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: You'll wanna turn off your flashlight, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Jacob feels the same way about technology as you do.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Once I open this door, there's no turning back. You sure this is what you want?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: So be it.  Jacob? I'm here with John Locke. We're coming in now.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Jacob. This is John. Aren't you going to say hello, John?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN:  I told you he wouldn't.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Who—what are you talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: You can't see him?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: See who?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Jacob! He's sitting right here, in this chair!  Yes, I know, but he insisted.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: What is this?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: You wanted the secrets of the Island?  Well, here they are. This is the man who can answer every single-  I am not. He made me bring him here—do you think that that was my—sorry, may I finish?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: You're crazy.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Excuse me?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: You don't know anything about the Island, do ya? You just...made it all up.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN:  Jacob, please, I can't hear him if you're gonna talk over what he's saying—
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Stop. Stop. Shut up! You're putting on a show for me? Or do you...do you really think there's someone there?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I know there's someone there!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: You don't know anything.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I'm sorry you feel that way, John. And I'm sorry that you're too limited to see.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: You're pathetic.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 VOICE: Help me.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: What did you just say?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I—I didn't say anything.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Oh yes you did. I heard you,  you said...
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN:  That's enough, you've had your fun!
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: What was that?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: That was Jacob.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: What did you hear in there, John? What did Jacob say to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: He didn't say anything to me. You did.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: There is no Jacob, Ben. I'm not gonna be taken in by the little show you put on last night. You're a fraud. And it's time your people were told the truth. And this is not the way we came.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I'm taking us back another way. I wanted to show you something first.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: I've seen enough.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: You know, John, you're not wrong.  Some of the things I've told you—some of the things I've told everybody—are simply not true.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Like what?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Well, for starters, I wasn't born on this island.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Then where did you come from?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: That's what I wanna show you.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Morning. Okay, wait. Put it right—right down there. What's the problem now? You're usually Chatty Cathy in the morning.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: It's my birthday. I dunno why I keep fooling myself into thinking that one of these years you're actually gonna remember.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Well, I'll tell you what. All we gotta do this morning is run this stuff out to Pearl station. Why don't we go up to the mesa, drink some beers? Have some...I dunno, father and son time.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I'd like that.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Okay.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Well, you sure can't say it ain't beautiful.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Do you really blame me?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Do you really think it's my fault that she died?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: What do I know...
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Why do you keep looking at your watch? You got a date?  Listen...if it makes you feel any better, I will do my best to remember your birthday next year.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: I don't think that's going to happen, Dad. 
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: What do you mean?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: You know, I've missed her too. Maybe as much as you have. But the difference is, for as long as I can remember, I've had to put up with you. And doing that required a tremendous amount of patience.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Goodbye, Dad.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 ROGER: Ben?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 RICHARD: You want us to, um...go get his body?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: No, leave him out there.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: This is where I came from, John. These are my people. The DHARMA Initiative. They came here seeking harmony, but they couldn't even coexist with the Island's original inhabitants. And when it became clear that one side had to go, one side had to be purged, I did what I had to do. I was one of the people that was smart enough to make sure that I didn't end up in that ditch.  Which makes me considerably smarter than you, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: What did Jacob say to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Why did you do this?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Because you heard him. Now, I need to know what he said.
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: Help me...
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: John, I'm not going to ask you again. What did he say to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode20 LOCKE: He said, "Help me."
Lost.Season03.Episode20 BEN: Well, I certainly hope he helps you, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Anyone want to venture a guess as to what Jack's going to be showing us out here in the middle of nowhere?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 HURLEY: I dunno. Stuff. Probably secret stuff.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Why does everything have to be such a secret? How about some openness for a change?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 HURLEY: We kept the parachute lady secret.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Ah, that's different.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: Different how?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Well, because we weren't out there playing football with them—
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: Nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Wait. You had one of your flashes again, didn't you?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: No, Charlie. I didn't.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: We're here.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: A couple of nights ago, Juliet came to me and she told me everything: that Ben had sent her here to find out which of our women were pregnant...
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KATE: So what, you guys were doing tests on us?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JULIET: No, but that's what he wanted me to do. I've been leaving tapes at the medical station. You all heard what he said; they're coming tomorrow. Sun, I'm sorry that I lied to you.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: While I appreciate your honesty, Jack, it doesn't explain why you brought us out here.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: DANIELLE!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Show 'em.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: When Juliet told me they were coming, the first thing I thought was, "Where the hell are we gonna hide this time?" But hiding's pointless. They're just gonna keep coming back. So I went out and I found some help. And for the past few days she's been bringing dynamite back from the Black Rock. For the very first time we know exactly what they want, when they're coming to get it, and they have no idea that we're gonna be waiting for 'em. So Juliet's gonna mark the tents with the white rocks just like she was told to, but there's not going to be any pregnant women inside; there's gonna be plenty of what we just used on that tree. So tomorrow night, we stop hiding, we stop running, we stop living in fear of them, because when they show up, we're gonna blow 'em all to hell.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Oh, bloody hell!! Why are we even doing this?!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 LIAM: Chin up, mate. We're headlining.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Headlining? We're playing Clitheroe — the arse-end of nowhere.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 LIAM: A gig's a gig. We're building our fan base.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Will our fan base pay for a new sodding tire?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 LIAM: Only if we show up. So let's just get on with it, shall we?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: You know what, Liam? You get on with it. I quit.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 LIAM: You giving up?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: There's nothing to give up on! We're broke. The album's not selling. We're a bloody joke—
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DRIVER: Hey, shut it! Listen!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: That's us. We're on the radio.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 LIAM: That we are.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: We're on the bloody radio!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 LIAM: I told you, baby brother, we're gonna be bloody rock stars!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NAOMI: Can I ask you something?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Yeah?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NAOMI: Who are you people about to go to war with?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Now that's a long story. Wanna ask me something else?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NAOMI: You having a laugh?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: No, of course not. I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NAOMI: You're from Manchester then?!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: I am. My band got its start at the Night and Day bar on Oldham Street.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NAOMI:  What band?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Oh, we're called Drive Shaft.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NAOMI: Yeah, yeah, I know you.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: We had our moment in the sun—
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NAOMI: No, not that, the crash. You're the dead rock star. They made a big deal out of you when they found the plane — huge memorial service, new album.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: There's a new album?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NAOMI: Yeah. God, it was everywhere... a greatest hits thing.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NAOMI: Hey, look on the bright side. You're not really dead, right?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Yeah, right.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ROUSSEAU: We need more wire so we can trigger these from a safe distance.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: I can get some people to start stripping the plane wreckage.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ROUSSEAU: Good. I should be able to finish rigging these tents in the next 24 hours. We'll be ready by tomorrow night.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: We need to talk about Naomi's phone.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Not now.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: If you're angry I doubted you, I'll be happy to make a sincere apology later, but now we have a means of—
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Look I'm a little bit busy right now, Sayid—
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: And I am trying to get us off this Island, Jack!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: I can't transmit using this phone because Danielle's distress signal is overriding the frequency.  If you tell me where the radio tower is, I can go there, switch off your message, and call for help.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ROUSSEAU: That signal has been playing for the last 16 years and nobody has heard it. What makes you think that you'll have better luck?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: But Naomi's boat is only 80 miles offshore. I know if we eliminate Danielle's signal, they will hear us—
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JULIET: No, they won't.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: And why is that?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JULIET: We're jamming it.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JULIET: Ben is using one of the DHARMA stations to block all of the signals off of the Island except for ours.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: What station?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JULIET: They call it the Looking Glass.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: The Looking Glass.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JULIET: Yes, but it's underwater. I have no idea where it is.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: I believe I do.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: Look, I know Jack thinks it's best, but, you know, what if they're coming for him again?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Claire, listen to me. I'm going to protect you. I'm going to protect Aaron. I promise. Everything is going to be fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: Er, sorry. Er, Charlie. Can you give me a hand with something?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Yeah, Desmond. Course.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: So, you ready to tell me what you saw this morning?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: Aye.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Right. So how's it happen this time?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Come on, Des. You can tell me. I can take it.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: What I saw, Charlie, was Claire and her baby getting into a helicopter. A helicopter that lifts off — leaves this Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Are you sure?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: Aye.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: A rescue helicopter on this beach?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: This Island — that's what you saw?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: We're getting bloody rescued! I thought you were gonna tell me I was gonna die again!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: You are, Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Wait, what?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: If you don't, none of it will happen. There won't be any rescue. I'm sorry, brother, but this time — this time you have to die.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 MR. PACE: Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on, Charlie! Jump in. I'm gonna catch you boy!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: No. You're just going to back away.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 MR. PACE: Don't be daft. Jump in.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 MR. PACE: I promise, Charlie, I'm gonna catch ya.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 LIAM: No he won't.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 MR. PACE: Zip it, you! Don't listen to your brother. Just jump on in. There's nothing to be afraid of, Charlie. I'll catch ya, I promise.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: I did it!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 MR. PACE: You've got it.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Seen it!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 MR. PACE: You're swimming, Charlie, you're swimming!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: What are you writing?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE:  Nothing. All right, tell me.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: You sure you wanna know? I mean it might be easier if you jus—
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Yeah. I want to know.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: You're inside a hatch. It's, er... a room full of equipment. There's a blinking yellow light above a switch. You flick the switch... light goes off... and then you drown.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE:  When?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: I don't know.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: You sure you saw Claire and Aaron get on that helicopter?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: Aye.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: So, before I drown, I just have to flip a switch.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: That's right.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Where is it, then?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: Now this is the Looking Glass. Its an underwater DHARMA station. Please, can you tell me anything you might know about this place?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JULIET: I've never been down there. I don't know anyone who has.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Why not?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JULIET: There was some accident. Ben told us that the station was completely flooded.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Well, if it's flooded then how does it still work?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: How it still works is irrelevant. The question is, how do we get it to stop working, so we can use the satellite phone. The diagram shows that the Looking Glass is connected to the Island by a cable. I feel sure that this is the very same cable down the beach which runs into the ocean. So if we follow the cable, it should lead us to the station.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: So how are we gonna get in?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: We swim in. There's a moon pool. A room with an open floor at the base of the station, big enough for a submarine to dock. Even if the station's flooded, I think I'll be able to find the relay switch and disable it.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: What about swimming back out?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: No. No, I'm not letting you go on some suicide mission just to flip a switch.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: But someone has to do it or we'll never leave this Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: I'll do it. Swim down, turn off that bloody switch, swim back up. Piece of cake.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Charlie, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: I was junior swim champion in Northern England. I can hold my breath for four minutes. I know exactly what you're talking about, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: No. And there's no reason to do this now. We're going to focus on the Others, and then we'll deal with this.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: Wait a minute. We have the chance to signal for a rescue.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Look, for 90 days I've been asked to make decisions for this entire camp. There you go. I just made one.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BERNARD: Rose, that's a sailor's hitch. It's not gonna hold. You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ROSE: Oh, so now you're knot expert.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BERNARD:  Well, trust me, it's, uh...
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BERNARD: How did you do that?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ROSE: Watch and learn, dear. Watch and learn.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JIN:  나한테는 언제 말해 줄 거야? 자기야, 제발. 테이프 들을 때 줄리엣이 우리 이름을 거론하던데. 모두 다 당신을 보고 있었어. 혹시 임신때문에 그런 거 아니야?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SUN: 나 우리 애기 봤어요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JIN: 뭐? 
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SUN: 줄리엣이 검사실에 데려갔는데, 그랬는데... 
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JIN: 그래, 괜찮대? 
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SUN: 응, 아주 건강하대요. 
Lost.Season03.Episode21 HURLEY: Hey!!! Look, there!!! Look!!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAWYER: Get off him, dammit, it's OK.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: What?! He's one of them!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAWYER: I know, I know, it's OK. He was in the cage next to me. I know this guy. What the hell are you doing here, Karl?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: They're coming. My people.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAWYER: Sorry you came all this way for nothing, but we already know.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: Then why are you still here?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAWYER: Because when your people show up here tomorrow night, we're gonna be ready for 'em.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: Tomorrow? No. No, they're coming tonight. They're coming right now!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ALEX: Hey! When'd you get back?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BEN: Just now.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ALEX: Where's Locke?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BEN:  Here's your gun back.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 RICHARD: Ben, what's going on?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BEN: Where's Ryan?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 RICHARD: He's at his tent, are you...
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BEN: It's time to get them.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 RICHARD:  But you said tomorrow.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BEN: Jacob wants it to happen now.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 RICHARD: Look, what happened out there--did John see...
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BEN: John had an accident. Ryan!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 RYAN: Yes sir.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BEN: If you leave right now, how long will it take you to reach their camp?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 RYAN: Well, if I take my ten best, we could set up to hit 'em by nightfall.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BEN: Then you'd better get going.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 RICHARD: No, no, Ben, wait, moving at this schedule, Juliet may not be ready. What if she hasn't had time to...
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BEN: Then we'll take all their women. And we'll sort out the ones we need later.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 RYAN: And the men?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BEN: If any of them are stupid enough to get in your way, kill 'em.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 RYAN: All right.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ALEX: Karl. It's me.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: I thought you were bringing rabbit.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ALEX: You have to go. Now.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: What? Did he find out I was out here?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ALEX: No. But he's sending Pryce to their beach camp right now, you have to warn them.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: Warn them?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ALEX: You have to go, now!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: I thought they were going to just take the pregnant women.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ALEX: If you take the outrigger, you'll get there a few hours before them.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: Whoa, wait, Alex...
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ALEX: He's gonna kill them, Karl! Austen and Ford saved your life. You owe them. You better take this.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: If I get caught, your father's gonna kill me this time.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ALEX: Is he my father?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ALEX: Now go.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Is that everything?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK:  You trust him?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: You don't trust me? What about her!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: She's a spy. She's supposed to mark the tents of the pregnant women with white rocks so they can take them.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JULIET: They know, Karl, but thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 HURLEY: So what are we going to do?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SUN: We have to leave now. Hide.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BERNARD: Where? It's their Island; if they wanna kill us, they'll find us.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: The sun's gonna go down in a few hours.  Do we have enough wire yet?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ROUSSEAU: Not even close.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: We've gotta figure out a different way of setting the dynamite off.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: We could shoot.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: We don't have enough guns. He said that ten of them are coming, armed.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: Not the Others, the tents. We can camouflage the dynamite next to the tents. Target it from our positions at the tree line.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Juliet marked three tents, that means we need three guns.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 HURLEY: Whoa!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KARL: Here. You can have mine too.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ROUSSEAU: I'll be your third.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: We'll take your gun, but you're not staying here. You're gonna lead everyone to the radio tower. Everyone.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: Radio tower?!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Now, if this doesn't work, we can't risk losing the chance of getting in contact with Naomi's boat, so everything has to happen at the same time. Charlie? You still up for a swim?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Yeah, I believe I am.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: I'll go with him.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: OK. We better get to it.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 LIAM: Ho ho ho. It's here, baby brother. Christmas is here. Oi, are these the birds from row two? Well done, mate. Well, as you have spent another year as the only drug-free rock star in the world, I'm gonna share a little known fact with you. Father Christmas lives just down the street from here.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Father Christmas lives in Helsinki?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 LIAM: Indeed he does. And in case you haven't noticed, baby brother, Finland is the bloody North Pole. Therefore, a very special gift for you this year.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Liam, no. Mum gave you that. You're the first born. It was her father's and his father before that...
Lost.Season03.Episode21 LIAM: And it's a family heirloom, and that's why we named the band after Dexter bloody Stratton. I know. But Charlie--let's be honest--we both know I'm a sodding mess. But you, you're different. You're gonna get married, have a family, a baby. I'll be lucky if I hit thirty.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Don't say that, Li.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 LIAM: The ring has to stay in the family, Charlie. So please, take it. Mum would have wanted it this way. Pass it on to your little one someday. I need to know it's safe.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: I'll hold on to it. But I won't take it. Hey, fits. Look at that.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 LIAM: Happy Christmas, baby brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: You need some help?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: Why didn't you tell me you were going to do this?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: I didn't want you to worry.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: Well, it's dangerous, isn't it? Swimming into some underwater station.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: It's what needs to be done to get us all rescued. I'll be fine, Claire. Now you've gotta promise me something. While I'm gone, don't worry about me.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: 'K.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: I'll take him.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Hey! All right turnip head, now you take care of your Mum while I'm away, OK?  I love you.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: See you soon.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: Be careful Charlie, 'K?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Yeah.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Sorry, guys. Thanks, man.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 WOMAN: Hey, help me! Help! Help! Help!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: OI!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 WOMAN: Help!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Oi! Get the hell away from her.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: What are you doing? Leave her alone!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: You OK, Miss?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NADIA: Yes, I think so, yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE:  Here you go.  Pardon me while I have a heart attack. The last time I was in a fight I was eight years old.  And I lost.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NADIA: Well, that makes you even more of a hero, doesn't it?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: I just did what anyone would do.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NADIA: Three people walked by the alley.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 NADIA: They saw me, but they just kept on going. You are a hero, sir. And don't let anyone ever tell you differently.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: What's that?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: It's a weight belt. Should bring you down quicker than swimming. Well, every second counts.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: So I just take it off when I hit bottom, swim up through the moon pool, into the station, swim into whichever room has the yellow blinking switch, flip it. Nothing to it.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: So how long can you really hold your breath for?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Does it matter?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BERNARD: You want me to hit another one?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: No, you've made your point.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ROSE: Bernard, this is not pheasant hunting in Montgomery County.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BERNARD: I know what I'm doing.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ROSE: No, you don't. Pheasants don't shoot back.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 BERNARD: Nothing's gonna happen to me, Rose. I just have to shoot a tent. And I'll be right behind ya.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ROSE: Then I'm staying, too.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: No, you're not, Rose.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Everyone's gathering down at the south end of the beach. No one's staying behind but the shooters.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ROSE: Says who? You wanna give me your word that nothing's going to happen to my husband, then I go.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: I'll give you my word that if we don't kill everyone that shows up here in about an hour, it's not gonna matter where Bernard is.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 ROSE: I like you better since you got back, Jack. You're almost an optimist.  Come on. If you're gonna be hiding in the bushes, let's get ya into something dark.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: You better get going. Rousseau says it's about a day's walk up to the radio tower.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: I'm not taking them to the tower. You are.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Excuse me?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: You're not staying behind.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: This was my idea.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: And I'm perfectly capable of executing it.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: I owe them!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 SAYID: What are you more concerned about, killing the Others, or getting our people off this Island? This afternoon you said you were our leader. It's time for you to act like one. Lead them to the radio tower, Jack. And then take us all home.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 HURLEY: Dudes, wait! I heard. I heard what you're doing. I wanna come with. Everyone — they're all going to the radio tower ... and I'm sick of trekking and, you know, explosions. I think I can help you guys out. I'm a really good paddler.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: You can't go, Hurley.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 HURLEY: Why not?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Because... you're too big! You won't fit in the boat.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 HURLEY: That's uncool, man.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Wait, wait, wait!
Lost.Season03.Episode21 HURLEY: Dude, it's fine. I don't even wanna go on your stupid boat.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Catch up with you later. Just remember I love you, man.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 HURLEY: Yeah, whatever, love you too.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK:  You got water in there? Good, good. How about you, lot of water? Good.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 KATE: So here we go again, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK:  Here we go again.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JULIET: The tents are all marked. We're set.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 JACK: Sayid find the third shooter?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 HURLEY: Ready, Claire? Need a hand with the little guy?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: Er, no, thanks. I'm OK.  How's my little sweetheart? We're just going to go for a little walk, so hold onto Mum, OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: This is it. Ready?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Hiya. Do you want a blanket?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: Oh, thanks. I got one.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Well, you're warming for two, take mine.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: So, first plane crash?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE:  What gave it away?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Ah, you can always spot the newbies. We're gonna be OK, you know.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: Are we?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: We're alive, we're on a beautiful Island. We'll sleep under the stars, and before you know it, the helicopters will come and take us all home.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: You really think they'll find us?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Well, yeah. Why wouldn't they?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: I'm Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CLAIRE: I'm Claire. Nice to meet you, Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: It's nice to meet you.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: We're here.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE:  I want you to give this to Claire for me.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND:  What is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: It's the five best moments of my... sorry excuse for a life. My greatest hits. You know, memories. They're all I've got.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: You don't have to do this Charlie.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: I'll go.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: No, you--your flashes.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: Maybe I keep seeing you die because I'm supposed to take your place.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: What about your girl, Penny?
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: What about your girl? Besides, I might be luckier than you. Keep your memories to yourself. I'll take it from here.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: I don't know what to say.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 DESMOND: Well, you could tell me where the, er, weigh belt is.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: Right there behind you.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE: You and I both know... you're not supposed to take my place, brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode21 CHARLIE:  I'm alive. AH! I'm alive!!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 STEWARDESS: Would you fasten your seat belts? Would you put your seat belt back on, please?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 WOMAN: Oh.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 STEWARDESS: Would you fasten your seat belt, please?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.  Can I get another one of those, please?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 STEWARDESS: I'm sorry, sir. We'll be landing in 20 minutes.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Well, 20 minutes is a long time.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 STEWARDESS:  How about a newspaper instead? ... And if you could buckle your seatbelt, sir?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 STEWARDESS: Please fasten your seatbelt. Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CAPTAIN: Sorry about the bumps, folks, we're just hitting a little warm air as we make our descent into Los Angeles. Please keep those seatbelts fastened and we'll have you on the ground shortly.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 VOICEMAIL: You've reached three one zero five five five zero one four eight. Please leave a message.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Hey. It's me. I, er, I just read... 
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Oh, forgive me.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KID: Mom! Mom! Mom!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MOTHER: Help!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KID: Mom!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: You have everything you need?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAYID: No, but I made the best out of what we have.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Bernard and Jin?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAYID: They're both excellent shots... and highly motivated. The dynamite's in place. We won't miss. Jack, no matter what happens here, I want you to keep moving; keep moving for that radio tower. Don't turn back for any reason. I'm willing to give my life if it means securing rescue, but I'm not giving it up for nothing. You understand?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK:  Yeah. I understand.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAYID: And good luck.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: You too.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROSE: If I told you that I'd help you with your SOS sign, would you change your mind?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BERNARD: No ma'am.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROSE: Then I want you to say it again.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BERNARD: Rose—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROSE: Say it, Bernard.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BERNARD: I am a dentist. I am not Rambo.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROSE: And don't you forget it.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Charlie's gonna be fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CLAIRE: Yeah. 'Course he is.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JIN: 잭 옆에서 떨어지지 말고, 피곤하면 꼭 쉬어라. 
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SUN: 진수 씨... 왜 이러는 거에요? 
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JIN: Because...we have to go home.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK:  All right. Let's do it.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: Jack. Can I ask you a question?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Sure.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: What did you do for a living before you became Moses?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK:  I was a doctor.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: Right, course you were. Well, I need your attention for a minute, doctor.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI:  Is she OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Why wouldn't she be?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: Because none of your people trusts her. No offense.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET:  You know what, why don't you catch up to me when you're done.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Juliet...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: It's fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI:  So, I need to show you how this wonderful gadget works in case anything happens to me. You need to be able to call my boat.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: OK. Show me.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: It's actually simple. You turn her on here. This opens a direct channel to the freighter. Give her a tap here. Wait for the beep, and say hello.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: And that's it?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: That's it. Once the rock star turns off whatever underwater contraption's jamming us up, this red light will turn a lovely shade of green. That'll be any time now, yeah?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Hopefully.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Who are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 GRETA: Look, if you tell us how you got down here, we won't hurt you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: I came in my invisible submarine. Don't you see it?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 GRETA: Hey! Take it easy.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Take it easy? He's one of them. Why are you here, huh? How did you find out about this station?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Juliet told us. She's one of us now. In case you haven't heard.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 GRETA: Stop. We gotta call Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Oh yeah. Let's call Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: You're inside a room full of equipment. There's a blinking yellow light, above a switch...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: ... You flick the switch, light goes off. Then you drown.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Come in. Come in, Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Hello?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Ben, it's Bonnie. Ben, are you there? Can you hear me, Ben?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Why are you breaking radio silence?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: One of them's down here.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: I'm sorry, what?!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: We have him tied up, but he's here. One of them swam down here.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Who? Which one?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: He won't tell us.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE:  It's Charlie! Tell him I said hi!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: How did... how does he know about the station?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: He said Juliet told them.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: All right, sit tight, don't do anything, I'm sending help.  Mikhail, you need to go down to the Looking Glass and find out what Charlie Pace is doing down there.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: You told us The Looking Glass was inoperable. Flooded.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: I lied. Mikhail, I need you to go now.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: I can be there by dawn. But if Juliet told them about the Looking Glass, what else did she tell them?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Ryan, come in. Ryan, are you there?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: Your walkies all off?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: Yes, sir.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: Did you get a good look?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 FEMALE OTHER: The tents are marked with white coral, three of 'em. Juliet did her job.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: All right, let's do this.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 FEMALE OTHER: It's empty!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: Get away from the tent!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: It's a trap! Move!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BERNARD: Please, God.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MALE OTHER: Tree line!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: I got your man! Drop your weapons!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: I got your man!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: It's over!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MALE OTHER: Don't. Finger off the trigger.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 [Miles away, the main group watch the smoke rise from the beach.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROSE: There were supposed to be THREE explosions.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE:  It didn't work.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TANNOY: Doctor Leon to surgery, Doctor Leon to surgery.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DOCTOR: There you go. Good as new.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DOCTOR: The news people are waiting for you outside. You being a hero and all.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Right. The woman, how is she?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DOCTOR: She's been stabilized. Thank god you were on that bridge.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Right.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DOCTOR: Sorry, no visitors in ER.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: It's OK. She... we used to be married.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DOCTOR: Come on in.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SARAH: What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: We saw... a car accident.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SARAH: Are you OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SARAH: Are you drinking again?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SARAH: Are you, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: No. Why did you come down here, Sarah?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SARAH: Erm, I'm still your emergency contact. What were you doing driving around at two o'clock in the morning?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: You think maybe you could give me a lift home?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SARAH: I don't think that would be appropriate.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Well, thanks for coming down, Sarah.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SARAH: Goodbye, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SUN: Why were there only two explosions?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Maybe they didn't have to blow the third tent.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROSE: But those gunshots, what was that all...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: He's OK, Rose.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SUN: Do you believe that?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Listen, they had no idea that we were waiting for them. And Sayid's with your husbands, they're gonna be fine and they're gonna be a couple of hours behind us.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SUN: Then we should wait for them here. You go on...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: No. No one gets left behind.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROSE: If you say live together die alone to me, Jack, I'm gonna punch you in your face.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK:  Fair enough, Rose. Fair enough.  But we have a plan. And for all we know, it worked. It's gonna be OK, everything's gonna be all right. Let's just keep moving, OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SUN:  It's OK, let's go.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: I'm gonna ask you this one more time. Why are you here?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: I'm here, to turn off your jamming equipment. It's in there, next to the flashing yellow light.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 GRETA: How do you know about that?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: I know because I know. Whatever you ladies do to me, I'm going to turn it off.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: You are, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Most definitely am.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: So what's the code?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Oh Charlie, if you're gonna turn off the jamming equipment, you're gonna need the code. And only three people know it. Me, her and Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Well, guess I won't need the code. Since this entire station's gonna be flooded anyway. I just turn off your little jammer and the helicopters come and rescue all my friends.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: But if this station floods, what happens to you?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: I die.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: They're all dead. Diane, Ivan, all of 'em, dead. And Shephard and his people, they're all gone.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Gone, gone where?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: I dunno. Did you hear me? They killed seven of our—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: Tom! Calm down and tell him the good news.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: What good news?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: We caught three of 'em. The one's who stayed behind to blow up the tents. Ben, they knew we were coming.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: It was Juliet. She betrayed us.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Just figure out where she is, Tom.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN:  Get up.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: OK, junior, where the hell did—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: They're not talking.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Who do you have?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: Jarrah, Kwon and the dentist.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Shoot Kwon.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: If you want them to answer questions, kill Kwon. Do it now.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JIN: 지옥에나 떨어져라. 
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: I dunno what that means, but I'm sure it's lovely.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BERNARD: No, wait. No.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JIN: No. No talk.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BERNARD: No, please.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: You talk to me, nobody will get hurt. Now tell me where your people are.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAYID: He's lying, he's going to kill us all any—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: Where are they?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: Sayonara.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BERNARD: A radio tower. They're hiking to a radio tower.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: Why in the hell are they going there?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BERNARD: A woman... parachuted here. She has a satellite phone and they're gonna call her ship.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN:  Juliet thought we were coming tomorrow. So why were they waiting for us tonight?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN:  You heard him. How'd you know?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BERNARD: A kid... told us. He came in a canoe, and he warned us.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: What kid?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BERNARD: Karl. He said his name was Karl.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: You heard that, Ben?  Ben?!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: I heard.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: What do you want us to do, kill 'em?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: No. Not yet.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RICHARD: We're going to the radio tower?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Not we, Richard, me. You're going to take everyone to the Temple as planned.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RICHARD: Now might not be the best time to go tromping off on your own.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Oh really? And why not?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RICHARD: Because people are asking questions, Ben. About leaving home, about what happened to Locke, about Jacob. Not to mention the rapidly spreading rumor that everyone that went down to the beach is dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: They're not all dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ALEX: Where are you going?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Hello, Alex.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ALEX: I asked where you were going.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Well, I thought I might go for a walk! See if I can't find Jack and all his friends.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ALEX:  I'm coming with you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: All right.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ALEX:  What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: I said all right. In fact, I think it's a good idea. I mean, you do want to see Karl again, don't you?  Get your pack, I'm leaving in 10 minutes.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RICHARD: There's 40 of them. And you're alone. They're gonna do whatever it takes to get off the Island. What do you think is gonna happen when you get there?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: I'm going to talk them out of it.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Something's wrong.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: Lots of things are wrong, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Jin, Bernard and Sayid... they should have caught up to us by now. I want to go back to make sure they're all right.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: 'Course you do.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: What's that supposed to mean?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: It means, Kate, there's always someone to go back for.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: What's the matter with you?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: Nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE:  Nothing?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: I'm fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Why don't you just tell me what happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: What you do that for?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: To wake you up. Ever since you got that tape from Locke, it's like you've been sleepwalking. You don't care about our friends, fine, but it's like you don't care about anything anymore. And since when did you start calling me Kate?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: You know. They sent Juliet to check out Sun, but she was there to check and see if I'm pregnant too.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: Well, let's hope you're not.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: The light's still red?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Des. Des!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: Charlie! Bloody hell! You all right?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Not for long if you don't get out of here. You have to hide, Des, hide, hide, there's people in there! Quick, hide hide hide. Go go go! Hide hide hide.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Who's he talking to?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE:  I feel like standing... stupid people...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Who are you talking to?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: I wasn't talking to anyone, I was just singing.  You all everybody! You all everybody! You all everybody! You all everybody!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Shut up.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Right, OK, you got it.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE:  Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MALE DOCTOR: Can I help you?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Just checking her chart.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MALE DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Hamill, Rob. The new chief of surgery. I don't think we've met yet.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Jack Shephard.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: Dr. Shephard, the hero? Twice over.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: You all right? After last night, I'm surprised that you'd even want to come in. Talk about right place right time, huh? This woman is very lucky you were there.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: If she was lucky, she wouldn't have a fractured back that was impinging upon her spinal cord. I'd like to operate first thing in the morning.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: You want to operate?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: I'm sorry, Jack, but this isn't your patient. And we are well aware of the issues; Gary Nadler's doing the surgery at 6 a.m..
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK:  With all due respect, Doctor Hamill, I'd rather do it myself.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: Jack. Last night you pulled this woman's 8-year-old son out of a burning car, then you went back for her. I think you've done enough.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: I want to do the surgery.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: Look. Everything's under control. She'll be fine. Go home, have a drink. You deserve it.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: The chart, please, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: You call me. I wanna know what happens.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 REPORTER: This morning .. ... bridge was shut down for several hours in the wake of a fiery car accident that left two injured, an unidentified 40-year-old woman and her son...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 REPORTER: ...Fortunately for the two of them, Dr. Jack Shephard, who was at the scene of the crash, pulled both victims from the burning wreckage and treated them at the scene until paramedics arrived. The victims were later transported to Saint Sebastian Hospital. Further details of their conditions have not yet been....
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: I'm going back.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: I'm going back to the beach.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: No way. We keep moving.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: I ain't asking permission.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER:  Look, you got a job to do here. I ain't gonna stand in your way of doing it. And you sure as hell don't need me.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: What do you think you're gonna get done, alone and unarmed?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: He won't be alone, I'll go with him.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: No!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Twenty minutes ago you weren't even interested in going, and now all of a sudden you're telling Jack that I'm—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: I didn't wanna go with you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Sawyer, it's a suicide mission without guns.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: I know where there are some guns. There's a hidden cache a couple of miles from here. I can take us back to the beach on a route past it.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Juliet, you don't have to do that.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: Yeah, Jack, I kinda do.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: Let's do this.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK:  Don't do anything stupid.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: I won't if you won't.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: Don't wait up.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: 
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: AH!! I told you to shut up!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: You know when you get a tune stuck in your head? This song just started coming to me, it's almost finished. Just need to find the bridge. 
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Get the speargun!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 GRETA: What, why?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: 'Cause I want it to hurt.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 GRETA: No, Ben said—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: You don't want to get it, I will.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 GRETA: Bonnie.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Oi, oi, oi, no! I'll, I'll shut up, I'll shut up, I'll shut up, I'll shut up.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Mikhail?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: I thought you two were on assignment in Canada?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 GRETA: He made us promise not to tell anyone.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Hello again.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: Where is the other one?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: This idiot swam down from a boat. I was just shooting at his friend. He dove down here.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: He's alone.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: Are you sure about that?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Here's a better question to ask, Cyclops. Why did your little friend Ben tell you people that this entire station was flooded when it isn't? Or, why these two have been jamming transmissions off the Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: What? Is that true?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 GRETA: That's Ben.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL:  I'll get it.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: You have to understand, everything I did, I did for the Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: The Island told you it was necessary for you to jam your own people?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Yes it did. You've always been a loyalist, Mikhail, now I'm asking you to trust me, to trust Jacob who told me to do this.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: Why would Jacob ask you to lie to your own people?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Because this Island is under assault by forces stronger than anything it's had to deal with in many many years. And we are meant to protect it, Mikhail, by any means necessary. The jamming was for everyone's security. We are in a serious situation here.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: So why not trust me?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: I made a mistake. I should have told you, and I apologize.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Mikhail, are you still there?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: Yes.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: I need you to help me. I need you to help me clean up this mess that I've made. I need you to kill Charlie. Make sure that the jamming mechanism continues to function at all costs. And we can't risk Greta and Bonnie telling the others about what we've done, so you'll have to take care of them too.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: How do I know you didn't say the same thing to them about me?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Because if I had, Mikhail, you'd already be dead.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: So, when you pulled us out of those polar bear cages and put us on the chain gang, what the hell did you have us breaking all those rocks for anyway?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: We were building a runway.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: Runway, for what?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET:  The aliens.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: I don't know what for, do you think they told me everything?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: Yeah, yeah, whatever you say. So you screwing Jack yet?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: No. Are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: How far away are these guns?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: There aren't any guns.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: I lied.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: You lied?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: It was the only way he'd let us go back.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: So why are you going back?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: Karma. Why are you going back, James?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Hey! Hey guys, wait up!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: What the hell do you want?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: I'm coming with you guys.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: Uh-uh, no way. Not a chance.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Come on, I can help. They're my friends, too, man. Look, Charlie wouldn't let me go with him, Jack's too busy leading to even talk to me. I just wanna help, please?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: For God's sake, Hugo, look at you. You're just gonna get in the way. You want to get us killed?  Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: If we head North, we should get to 'em before they reach the tower.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ALEX: Why did you let me come?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: I let you come because I'm delivering you to your new family. I let you come because you betrayed me, Alex.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ALEX: You locked Karl in a cage. You put him in a room and tried to brainwash him.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: I didn't want him to get you pregnant. I suppose I overreacted. We better get going.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ALEX: Ben. Why do you have to stop them? Why won't you just let them leave?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Because I can't, Alex.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 VOICE: Don't, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 WALT: Put the gun down.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 LOCKE: Walt!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 WALT: Now get up, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 LOCKE: He shot me and I can't... move my legs.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 WALT: You can move your legs. Now get out of the ditch, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 WALT: Because... you have work to do.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: You OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Yeah, I just... got a rock in my shoe.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: He didn't mean it, you know.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Sawyer. When he said that he didn't want you to go with him, he didn't mean it.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: He didn't mean it, why'd he say it?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: He was trying to protect you. That's why I asked you not to come back for me.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Hey. Why are you sticking up for Sawyer? He'd never do it for you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Because I love you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 VOICEMAIL: You have reached three one zero five five five zero...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DIRECTOR: Can I help you?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Sorry, I, er... Actually, I came, er... Is the funeral over?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DIRECTOR: There was no funeral, sir, only a viewing.  Nobody showed up.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Nobody? You sure?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DIRECTOR: Just you.  My deepest condolences. Friend or family?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Neither.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DIRECTOR: Would you like me to open it up?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: No... no.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DIRECTOR: Take your time.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK:  Damn it.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Danielle. How much further?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROUSSEAU: About an hour.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: The radio tower, when was the last time you were there?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROUSSEAU: The day I recorded the message. I'll take you to the tower, but I'm not leaving the island.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROUSSEAU: There's no place for me back there. This is my home now.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Hello, Jack. We need to talk.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 GRETA: What did Ben say?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Can we kill him?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: Is it possible to turn this equipment off?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: The equipment that's jamming the Island, can you turn it off?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 GRETA: Sure. Ben gave us the code.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: You are the only ones who have it?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Yeah. Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: What would happen if this station were to be flooded?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 GRETA: Nothing. The casing for the equipment is waterproof, it'll keep going forever.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: Then why do you need to be here?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Because Ben told us to. We were following orders.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: And you never asked why?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: No. Because I trust him. And I trust Jacob. And the minute I start questioning orders, this whole thing, everything that we're doing here falls apart.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL:  She makes an excellent point.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: No, please.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MIKHAIL: I'm sorry, Bonnie, I too am following orders.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: Hey!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: No, Des, no, don't! We need her.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN:  Hi, I'm Benjamin, I don't believe we've had the pleasure...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Don't talk to him!  What do you want?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Just a moment of your time. To talk, you and me, alone.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: For what?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Jack, you've just killed seven of my people, the least you can give me is five minutes.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: He alone?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: There's only two sets of tracks, his and hers.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Five minutes.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PHARMACIST: I'm sorry, sir, there are no more refills left on this prescription.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Ah, that's a mistake. I, uh, I only refilled it twice, could you check again?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PHARMACIST: I did check it again, Dr. Shephard, and that was the third refill, so there's nothing I can do.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Fine. I've got another prescription right here.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MAN: Hey, I know you. You're the hero.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: I'm not a hero.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MAN: Yeah yeah, we saw it on TV. Hey lady, what's wrong with you? Just give this guy whatever he needs. Do you know what he did?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Here it is, here. Oxycodone.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PHARMACIST: Dr. Shephard, you can't write a prescription for yourself.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: That's not me, that's Dr. Christian Shephard, I'm Dr. Jack Shephard, he's my father.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PHARMACIST: I'm gonna have to call your father's office to confirm this.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: He's out of town right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PHARMACIST: Well, I'm sure somebody in the office—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Don't bother.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Have a seat.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Not so long ago, Jack, I made a decision, that took the lives of over 40 people in a single day. I'm telling you this because... history is about to repeat itself, right here, right now.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Let me guess, you've got us surrounded, and if I don't do what you say, you're gonna... you're gonna kill all my people.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: No Jack, you are.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: And how am I going to do that, Ben?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: The woman you're travelling with. The one who parachuted onto the Island from that helicopter. She's not who she says she is.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: She's not, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: No, she's not.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Then who is she?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: She's a representative of some people who've been trying to find this Island, Jack. She's one of the bad guys.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Oh, I almost forgot, you're the... you're the good guys.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Jack, listen to me. If you phone her boat, every single living person on this Island will be killed. So here's what has to happen. Get that device, the phone she carries with her, and give it me. I will turn around, we'll go back to my people, you will turn around and go back to your people.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: I'm not going anywhere.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: May I have my walkie back?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: There's something you need to hear. Please.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Thank you. Tom, are you there?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: Yeah, I'm here.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN:  Your plan killed seven of my people, but the ones that you failed to kill are now holding your friends. Jin, Sayid, Bernard. At gunpoint.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAYID: Jack, don't give him anything!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BERNARD: Leave him alone!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: I said shut up!!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: And what's to stop me from snapping your neck?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN:  Tom, unless you hear my voice in one minute, shoot all three of them.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: Got it.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: I said don't move!!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Bring me the phone, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAYID: Don't negotiate with him—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: Gag him.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JIN: No!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Forty seconds.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: No. I'm getting them all off the Island. ALL OF THEM!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Let me ask you something, Jack. Why do you wanna leave the Island? What is it that you so desperately want to get back to? You have no one. Your father's dead, your wife left you, moved on with another man. Can you just not wait to get back to the hospital? Get back to fixing things? It's 20 seconds now. Just get me the phone, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Ten seconds. Bring me the phone.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: I'm not bluffing!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: I WON'T DO IT!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Five. Four. Three...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: No.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: I'm so sorry, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Tom. Are you there?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: Yeah, Jack, I hear you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: I'm going to lead my people up to the radio tower. And I'm gonna make a call. And I'm gonna get 'em all rescued, every one of them. And then I'm gonna come find you, and I'm gonna kill you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: What's the code?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Go away.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Bonnie, let's just get this over with, OK? What's the code?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: She's not gonna tell you, brother.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Yeah she's gonna tell me.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: What makes you say that?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Because you said it's my destiny to turn off that jammer. OK, Bonnie, we're both gonna die down here. All right, let's be perfectly honest. A one-eyed maniac just killed your friend, he shot you in the back. It would appear that your glorious leader, Ben, put him up to it. Are you a sodding idiot? You have the opportunity to make Ben very very angry. Why would you not take that?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Five, four, five...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Eight, seven, sev-...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Is that the code?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Five, five, four, three, seven, seven...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Start again.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Six, one.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Stop, Bonnie. Start from the beginning, start again. Bonnie, Bonnie! Wake up, stop. Bonnie, start again. Start again.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: "Good Vibrations."
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BONNIE: Beach Boys. "Good Vibrations." On the keypad, the numbers, they're notes. It was programmed by a musician.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Tie him up. He's coming with us.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ALEX: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN:  Alex. This is your mother.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROUSSEAU: I'll help you tie him up.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: What happened? What'd he say?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: It's not important right now. Just, get everything together—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Jack. Your knuckles. Here.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: What happened?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: He killed them. Bernard, Jin, Sayid, all three of them. He radioed the beach. And I let it happen. I had to let it happen. We can't tell Rose, or Sun, not yet. We gotta keep moving, I promised Sayid that we would keep moving.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: So why did you bring him back? Why didn't you just kill him?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Because I want him to see it. I want him to experience the moment that we get off this Island, and I want him to know... that he failed. And then I'll kill him.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 RYAN: It was an order, Tom, we had to follow it.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM: Ben doesn't know what the hell he's talking about, he's lost it! I mean, look at what they did to us. Instead of putting three bullets in the damned sand, we should have killed them for real.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: All they got left is three guys and four guns.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: And all we've got, James, are two people and no guns.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: So we'll wait 'til night.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET: That isn't going to change the fact that we're unarmed. If you wanna kill yourself, fine, but before you go, I can try—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: Shh! You hear that?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MALE OTHER: RYAN!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Woo!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: Stay in the bus, Hugo.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JULIET:  Stay right there, Tom.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 TOM:  OK. I give up.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: That's for taking the kid off the raft.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Dude, it was over, he surrendered.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 SAWYER: I didn't believe him.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: What are you doing, Dr. Shephard?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: I was just, uh... I was just checking the, uh, the Arland charts. Just wanted to... just wanted to see how the operation went.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: I left three messages on your voicemail, you didn't get them?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: My phone's broken.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: Let's go to my office, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: For what?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: We need to have a talk. Come on.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: You know, I know that you're... you're new around here, so you don't know much about—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: I know enough. But let's just walk down to my office—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: If you've got something to say to me, you can say it to me, right here.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL:  Will you excuse us, please?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: Mrs. Arlene, the woman you saved, woke up in recovery about two hours ago. She was in some pain but highly responsive to the reflex test and entirely lucid.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: That's... that's great.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: But then she described the series of events that caused her accident. She says she was driving over the bridge when she saw a man standing on top of the railing, about to jump off. She was distracted, lost control of her car. She ran into the median, rolled over and was hit by the van behind her. So the obvious question here, Jack, is how did you get to that flaming car so fast? What were you doing on that bridge?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Do you know how many years I've worked at this hospital? Do you know anything about me? Do you have any idea what I've been through?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: How much have you had to drink today, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: OK, I'll tell you what, you do this. You get my father down here, get him down here right now, and if I'm drunker than he is, you can fire me!  Don't you look at me like that. Don't you... pity me.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DR. HAMILL: I'm trying to help you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: YOU CAN'T HELP ME!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Attention, Others. Come in, Others. If you're listening in, I want you to know that we got you bastards. And, unless the rest of you wanna be blown up, you best stay away from our beach...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Hurley?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Where are you, what's going on?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Dude. I'm back at the beach.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Yeah, I went back to help Juliet and Sawyer. I, I saved them.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: They're OK, Juliet and—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Everyone's fine. Me, Sawyer, Juliet, Sayid, Jin, Bernard. We're all—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: What, wait. Bernard and Jin and Sayid, they're with you?!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Yeah, dude, I told you, I saved 'em all.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Hey, stay where you are, we're almost up to the tower. You'll be safer there.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Yeah, I got ya, we'll stay put until you, like, phone home.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CLAIRE:  What about Charlie, did he make it back yet?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 HURLEY: Not yet, but they're probably paddling home as we speak. Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Des? There's diving gear in those racks, yeah?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: Aye. There's plenty.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Why don't you take care of that, I'll tap out "Good Vibrations."
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: All right, mate.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Hey, Des.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: Aye?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: You get any flashes?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: No, nothing.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Meet you back here then.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: Aye.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: So much for fate.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Incoming transmission!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PENNY: Hello?! Can you hear me?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Yes, yes, I can hear you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PENNY: Who is this? Who am I speaking to?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Charlie er... Charlie Pace, I'm a survivor of Flight eight-one-five, Oceanic Flight eight-one-five.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PENNY: Er... where are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: We're on an island, we're alive.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PENNY: An island!! Well, where, what's your location?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: I dunno. Who's this?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PENNY: This is Penelope. Penelope Widmore. How did you get this frequency?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE:  Desmond? Desmond!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PENNY: Did you just say Desmond?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Yeah, he's here, he's with me.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PENNY:  Is he OK?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: He's brilliant! Hey, are you on the boat?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PENNY: What, what boat?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CHARLIE: Your boat, 80 miles off shore. Er... Naomi, parachutist.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PENNY: But I'm not on a boat! Who... who's Naomi?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PENNY: Hello, hello, is Desmond there? Desmond, can you hear me? Desmond?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 PENNY: Can you hear me?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: Penny!!! NO!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 DESMOND: Charlie!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CLAIRE: Shhh. Hey Aaron, it's OK, sweetie.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: What's the matter?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CLAIRE: I dunno, I think he's just a bit scared.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: Hard to blame him.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CLAIRE: What is it?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: What's your boyfriend's name? The rock star who swam down to the station?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 CLAIRE: Charlie, why?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: Charlie just got us rescued.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: Jack!! Jack, he did it!! Your friend bloody well did it!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: The green light, it's on. The jamming's stopped.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Use it then.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: All right.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 VOICE: Four, four, two..
Lost.Season03.Episode22 FEMALE VOICE: 
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: What's this?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: It's Rousseau's message, it's still blocking the signal.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROUSSEAU: It doesn't matter. We're here.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 VOICE:  Iteration one, seven, five...
Lost.Season03.Episode22 ROUSSEAU: I recorded this 16 years ago.  Three days before you were born. I guess we don't need it anymore.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK:  All right, do it.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: I can't get a signal in here.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: I'm getting something!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: It's gonna work! It's happening, we're gonna get off of this Island!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: We'll celebrate when we're home.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Jack! I know you think you're saving your people. But you need to stop this. It's a mistake.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: The mistake was listening to you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: This'll be your last chance, Jack. I'm telling you, making that call is the beginning of the end.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 NAOMI: I've got it, I've got a signal!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Jack, please, you don't know what you're doing!!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: I know exactly what I'm doing.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: JOHN!!!
Lost.Season03.Episode22 LOCKE: Step back, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: What did you do?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 LOCKE: What I had to. Now step back.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 LOCKE: Stay away from the phone.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: What are you doing, John?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 LOCKE: I don't wanna shoot you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 BEN: Do it, John! Shoot him! Do what you need to do—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 LOCKE: Please. Put the phone down.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: No. You're done keeping me on this Island.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 LOCKE: I will kill you if I have to.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Then do it, John.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 LOCKE: Jack. You're not supposed to do this.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MAN: Minkowski. Hello?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Who is this?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MINKOWSKI: Who is this?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: My name is Jack Shephard. Are you, are you on the boat, the freighter?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MINKOWSKI: How'd you get this channel?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Naomi, Naomi told us about your search team. About the boat.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MINKOWSKI: Naomi. You found her? Where is she? Who are you?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: I'm one of the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815. Can you get a fix on our location?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 MINKOWSKI: Hell yeah we can. Sit tight. We'll be right there.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 VOICE: Hello.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Hello? It's me. Whoa whoa, wait, don't, don't hang up, please. I know what you said, I just... I just need to see you, please? Yeah, yeah, out at the airport. You know where. Thank you.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Saw you on the news. Still pulling people out of burning wreckage, huh?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Old habits.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: You look terrible.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK:  Thanks.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Why did you call me, Jack?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: I was hoping that you'd heard. That maybe you'd go to the funeral.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Why would I go to the funeral?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: I've been flying a lot.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: What?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Yeah, that golden pass that they gave us—I, I've been using it. Every Friday night I... fly from LA to Tokyo or, Singapore, Sydney.  And then I... I get off, and I... have a drink, and then I fly home.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Why?
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: Because I want it to crash, Kate. I don't care about anybody else on board. Every little bump we hit, or turbulence, I mean, I... I actually close my eyes, and I pray that I can get back.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: This is not gonna change.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: No, I'm sick of lying! We made a mistake.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: I have to go. He's gonna be wondering where I am—
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: We were not supposed to leave.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Yes, we were.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 KATE: Goodbye, Jack.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: We have to go back, Kate.
Lost.Season03.Episode22 JACK: We have to go back!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NEWSREADER: Almost 30 minutes now since the start of this high-speed chase. We still have no information about who's driving this vehicle. Jeff, can you tell us where the chase started?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JEFF: We're getting reports that the pursuit began near the La Brea area, then travelled to a warehouse in the district south of the ten freeway.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NEWSREADER: Can you see how many people are in the car?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JEFF: It would appear to be just the one, the driver. We're not sure if that's the owner of the car. What you're seeing here are pictures of the ten freeway, south of downtown.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NEWSREADER: Is that a Camaro, Jeff?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JEFF: Yes, yes it looks like a vintage early 70's model.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Damn it.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 POLICEMAN: Show us your hands!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 POLICEMAN: Pull down the window, and show us your hands now!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 POLICEWOMAN: Now slowly open the door with your left hand.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 POLICEMAN: Get out of the car!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 POLICEMAN: Turn around, slow!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 POLICEMAN 2: On the ground!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 POLICEWOMAN: Now!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Stop! Don't you know who I am? Stop, wait, don't you know who I am? I'm one of the Oceanic six! I'm one of the Oceanic six!!!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DETECTIVE: So five minutes before you led ten cruisers on a chase across the city, you're minding your own business in a convenience store, until, you see something and freak out. Mr Reyes, why'd you run like that? Who'd you see in there? Listen buddy, I know you saw somebody in that store and it made you run away in a...
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: I wasn't running away from anyone.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DETECTIVE: Do you think I care that you're a celebrity? You crashed your Camaro in the wrong neighbourhood.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: I'm not a celebrity.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DETECTIVE:  Is that why you kept shouting "Hey I'm one of the Oceanic Six"? You wanna know a funny coincidence?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Sure.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DETECTIVE: I knew somebody on your plane.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Really?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DETECTIVE: Her name was Ana Lucia Cortez. She was my partner before I made detective. Dark hair. Gorgeous. Maybe you knew her? Maybe you met her on the plane? Before it took off?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Sorry, never met her.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DETECTIVE: Why don't you watch the tape. Maybe it'll spark something. I'm gonna get a doughnut, you want one?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: No thanks.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DETECTIVE: When I come back, you're gonna tell me who you ran from.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Help! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DETECTIVE: The hell is wrong with you?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DETECTIVE: What are you doing Reyes? Huh, you trying to get tossed into the nuthouse? 'Cause if that's what you want, I can make that happen right now, my friend.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: You can?  Oh thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Jack? You there dude? Beach to Jack, come in Jack. Beach to Jack—
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Right here, Hurley, what's up?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Hey. Did you guys make it to that radio tower thingy yet?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Yeah, and I talked to the people on the boat, they're on their way to pick us up right now.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Seriously? It worked?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Seriously, we're all on the way back to the beach right now, so you better pack your bags buddy .
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Hahaha! Dude that's great! Woohoo!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Any luck?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: Nothing, no sign of him. (She looks at Naomi lying on the ground) It's like he just disappeared. Why would Locke kill her? He hadn't even met her.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Because he's crazy.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: So what if he comes back?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: He comes back, I'm gonna kill him.  I'm gonna get everybody together, the sooner we get back to the beach, the better.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: Are we really going home?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Yeah. We're really going home.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SUN:  I can't believe I'm actually going to have my baby in a hospital.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CLAIRE:  Oh rub it in why don't you!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SUN:  Oh, no...
Lost.Season04.Episode01 ROSE: You ladies need a hand?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CLAIRE: No, we're just wrapping things up, thanks. You know, you must be very proud with Bernard, I hear he's quite the hero.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 ROSE: But everyone up here knows that the real hero is your man, Claire. If Charlie didn't turn off that gizmo, we'd still be getting a busy signal on that fancy phone. So you'd better make sure you treat him real good when we get back.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CLAIRE: Rose!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BEN: I need you to do me a favor. I need you to take Alex and get as far from here as possible.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 ROUSSEAU: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BEN: Listen to me, we don't have time for this. Everyone who stays here is going to die. Now get Alex and get away right now, I don't care where you go, just go, I will not have my daughter—
Lost.Season04.Episode01 ROUSSEAU: She is not your daughter.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Did I ever tell you I won the lottery? I had like a hundred and fifty million dollars. Worst thing that ever happened to me.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BERNARD: Oh yeah, who needs a hundred and fifty million dollars, right?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Now it'll all be gone. Cause they all think I'm dead. We get rescued and I go back. I'm gonna be free. (Pauses) I wanna do a cannonball. I've been walking up and down this beach everyday and looking out at this water. And I wanna do a cannonball.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BERNARD: Hurley. You wanna do a cannonball? Cannonball.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAYID: Are you alright Desmond?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DESMOND: We need to get to Jack. We can't let him get in touch with that boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: Easy, Scottie, everything's cool, boat's on the way.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DESMOND: What? On the way? No.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Hey where's Charlie?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DESMOND: No that woman, Naomi, she lied. The people on the boat aren't who they say they are!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JULIET: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: Then who are they?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Desmond, where's Charlie?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DESMOND: I don't know, but we need to get in touch with Jack, now!!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JULIET: It's alright, we can call him, we have a walkie. It's OK.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DESMOND: Where is it, get it.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BERNARD: What do you mean the people aren't who they say they are?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY:  Where's Charlie?!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 DESMOND:  I'm, I'm sorry brother. I...
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: That's our ride.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Hello.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MINKOWSKI: Hey Jack. This is George Minkowski. We're trying to get a lock on your signal there, but we're getting some RF interference. We're gonna need to re-jigger some of the settings on your sat phone.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Er sure, ok, just tell me what I gotta tell.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MINKOWSKI: How about you put Naomi on.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Naomi went to get some firewood. Can you hold on for a second, let me see if I...
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Where is she?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BEN: 
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: Look, we gotta call the Doc.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAYID: Did you listen to Desmond? Charlie wrote on his hand.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: Look, I'm sorry he's dead. But I don't even know what the hell "not Penny's boat" means.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAYID: Calling Jack accomplishes nothing.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JULIET: It would accomplish warning him.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAYID: It also means warning the people on the freighter that we're suspicious of them. I've no doubt they're monitoring our communications, if we call Jack...
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: You know what? I got the walkie, I'm making the call. Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: We better get going.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER:  Going where?!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 ROUSSEAU: I found blood. The girl's trail. Probably crawled away. Can't be more than 10 minutes ahead of us. We should go, now, and find her.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK:  We're taking him with us.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 ROUSSEAU: Why would we do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Because I don't trust him with anybody but me.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Alright, listen up. I need all of you to head back down to the beach. When these people show up, we wanna make sure that we're real easy for them to find. OK?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CLAIRE: You look worried, Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: The only thing I'm worried about is missing our ride home.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: I found her trail. She's headed West across the Island.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK:  Rousseau already found it, we're going after her right now.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: But, are you sure it's hers?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Unless someone else is bleeding.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: But if she didn't want us to find her, then she could have created a dummy trail. I think we should follow both just in case.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Kate, six hours from now we're gonna be sitting on that boat laughing about the fact that there was one final thing that we couldn't agree upon. Naomi is hurt, she ran into the jungle, she's not thinking about leaving fake trails.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: You're right.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: I'll track her down, why don't you get everybody back to the beach.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: You got it.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: Be careful, OK?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: The hell's gotten into you, Hugo? They'll all be back in the morning, if you just wait.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: You don't wait with warnings dude, you warn.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: And here I was thinking I was gonna get a good night's sleep.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: You almost got me that time. How about best out of seven?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NURSE: Are you ready for your meds, Hugo?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NURSE: Oh by the way, you have a visitor.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 VISITOR: Mr Reyes. Hello. My name is Matthew Abaddon. I'm an attorney for Oceanic Airlines. Can we talk for a few minutes?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: OK.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MATTHEW: I'm here, Mr Reyes, because we heard about your recent... episode. Your arrest. Your incarceration here. Frankly, we feel terrible about it. So, on behalf of Oceanic, I'd like to extend you an invitation for a little upgrade.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: What kind of upgrade?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MATTHEW: To a facility where the paint isn't peeling off the walls. Where you'd have your own bathroom. You could see the ocean from there...
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: I don't wanna see the ocean.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MATTHEW: No problem.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Actually, thanks, I'm... I'm fine right here.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MATTHEW: Are you fine Mr. Reyes?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: What do you mean?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MATTHEW: You're in a mental institution.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Who'd you say you were again? I'd like to see a business card.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MATTHEW: I must have left them at home.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Then we're done, dude.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MATTHEW: Are they still alive?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY:  What?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MATTHEW: You heard me.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Nurse. Nurse! Get out of here! You better get out of here! Help me. Help me, he's after me. No no no. That guy's after me. Help me.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NURSES: It's OK, it's OK.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: Alright there, Hugo?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Yeah, dude, I'm fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: You wanna talk about it?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Talk about what?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: Charlie. I mean, you two were buddies, I just thought...
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: We'll probably get to Jack faster if we don't talk.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: I'm gonna head up and tell 'em to slow down.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: I can keep up.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: Alright "esé"... Just holler if you need me.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Guys. Guys! Guys! Guys!!! Guys!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Uh oh.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 ROUSSEAU: The blood trail ends here.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: What do you mean?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 ROUSSEAU: It ends.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: You're telling me she stopped bleeding here?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 ROUSSEAU: No. I'm telling you that she fooled us. Doubled back.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BEN: Better call the boat. Tell 'em she's getting a real big bundle of firewood.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Where is it?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BEN: OK, I probably should have told you that I saw her take the phone, but you beat me up, Jack. I owed you one.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BEN: Kate took it when she hugged you.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BEN: She found the right trail too, but you wouldn't listen to her, so I guess she's taken matters into her own hands. But look on the bright side, at least somebody around here knows what the hell they're doing.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: Hello.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MINKOWSKI: Who's this?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: Uh, this is Kate.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MINKOWSKI: You with Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: No, no, he's not here.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MINKOWSKI: Where's Naomi?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: We're looking for her.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MINKOWSKI: What do you mean, you're looking for her?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NAOMI: Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: Naomi, listen to me. You're hurt, let me help you.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NAOMI: Help me? I just spent the last three days trying to get you people rescued. And you throw this knife in my back.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: No, no, it was not us.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NAOMI: Who?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: His name is John Locke.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NAOMI: Why?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: He said that you weren't who you said you were.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: I swear to God, we would never hurt you, you know us. Please. We need your help, please help us.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NAOMI: Give me the phone.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NAOMI: George. It's Naomi.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MINKOWSKI: Naomi, where have you been? What's going on over there?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NAOMI: I had an accident. I'm hurt.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MINKOWSKI: Wha, an accident. What accident? What happened? Naomi? Hello? Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NAOMI: I hit a tree branch, when I parachuted in. Took it through my gut.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MINKOWSKI: Why did they tell me you were getting firewood?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NAOMI: I guess they were afraid to tell you what happened to me until I could talk to you myself.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MINKOWSKI: We've lost our signal and we can't come get you. Can you change your tracking frequency?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NAOMI: Yeah.  Try it now.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 MINKOWSKI: Clear as a bell. Hang on Naomi, we'll get you back here ASAP, OK?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 NAOMI: I'm sorry, George. Just tell my sister that I love her.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Help! Help! Help!!!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: Hello, Hugo.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: You got yourself good and lost out here, Hugo. How did you get separated from the group?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: I just... fell behind, I guess.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: Is that why you were shouting for help?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: I got scared.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: What Desmond said happened down in that station, "not Penny's boat." Are you sure that's what Charlie wrote on his hand?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Jack should never have called those people.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: I couldn't agree more.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: It's gonna be hard, to talk them into thinking they're not coming here to rescue us.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: Well, we're just gonna have to try our best, Hugo. Because if we can't talk 'em out of it, then Charlie died for nothing.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: Where the hell have you been, Hugo?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Sorry, I was just er... I got lost.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAYID: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: I came here for the same reason you did, to warn Jack about the people on that boat. I already gave it a shot, but, I figured I might have better luck with some support.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAYID: You want my support? You can tell me why you destroyed that submarine.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SUN: 진수 씨!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BERNARD: Still in one piece.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 ROSE: Rambo.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BERNARD: Ow!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: I'll tell her.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: He's dead. Charlie's dead.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CLAIRE: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 PATIENT: I'd watch out if I were you.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: What you talking about, dude?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 PATIENT: There's a guy over there, staring at you.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: What guy?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 PATIENT: That guy.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CHARLIE: Hey man. Don't run. Hurley. Just, just, sit down. I wanna talk to you. Come on. Don't do what you did in the store. OK? There's no need to freak out.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: No need to freak out? I'm trying to buy some jerky and a slushy, and suddenly you're standing over there by the Ho Hos. You're dead, what do you expect me to do?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CHARLIE: Can we just sit down?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: I may be in a mental hospital, but I know you're dead, and I'm not having an imaginary conversation with you.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CHARLIE: I am dead. But I'm also here.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: OK, prove it.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Alright, OK.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Did you know you were going to die when you swam out there?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY:  Then why didn't you tell me?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CHARLIE: Because you would have tried to stop me. And since I was gonna do it anyway I thought I would spare you all the drama. And now you have to do something. But you're hiding from it. That's the real reason you ran when you saw me in the store. You knew I was here to tell you.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: I'm not listening to this. No, 'cause you're not here.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CHARLIE: I am here, you're being a baby.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: I'm gonna close my eyes and count to five, and when I open them, you'll be gone.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CHARLIE: I am here.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: One!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CHARLIE: Don't do this.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Two!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CHARLIE: They need you.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Three!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CHARLIE: They need you, Hugo.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Four!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CHARLIE: You know they need you.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Five!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 CLAIRE: What, what happened? I mean, how, how did he...
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: He was trying to help us.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JULIET: Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: You're not gonna shoot me, Jack. Any more than I was gonna shoot—
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: It's not loaded.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: Come on.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Let go of me! Do you know what he did?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAYID:  Yes, I know what he did!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: All I did, all I have ever done, has been in the best interest of all of us.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Are you insane?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: I know I... I have a lot of explaining to do. But, I never did anything to hurt any of you. I even risked my life to tell you there was a traitor in your midst. 
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: She helped us, John. All you ever did was blow up every chance we had of getting off of this island. You killed Naomi.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BEN: Well, technically, he didn't kill her, yet.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: Yes, he did.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: She just died. She didn't give you up, John. She covered for us, and she fixed this.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: They're on their way.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: She didn't cover for anyone. She wants her people to come here. And trust me, when they do, we had better be far away from here. I'm going to the Barracks. The Others abandoned them. It's the only place on the Island with any form of security right now, it'll have to do until I can think of something else. Until then, if you wanna live, you need to come with me.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: No one's going anywhere with you, John. Because they're not crazy.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: He's not crazy. What about Charlie? Charlie went down to that place so we could all be rescued. And whatever he did down there, it worked. But then something must have happened. He must have heard something before he...  I don't know why, but he changed his mind.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Because the last thing he did was to warn us that the people on that boat are not who they said they were. So I'm not listening to you. I'm listening to my friend. I'm listening to Charlie.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: Anyone else? There isn't much time.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BEN: Jack, with your permission, I'd like to go with John.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: He's all yours.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 BERNARD:  You said you'd never leave the Island. If you wanna go with Locke, I'll be right behind you.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 ROSE: I'm not going anywhere with that man.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 SAWYER: Same thing I've always done, Kate. Surviving.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 LOCKE: You know where to find us when you change your mind.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Do you ever miss?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Yeah, I was on my way back from a consult. Thought I'd drop by and pay you a visit. Horse?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: You're on. So, consult, huh? Does that mean you're back doing surgical stuff?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: H.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Reporters leaving you alone?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Yeah. Still have to sign some autographs when I go out for coffee.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Thinking about growing a beard.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: You'd look weird with a beard, dude. That's H-O. So, what are you really doing here, Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: I was just checking on ya, seeing if everything was OK.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Checking to see if I was nuts, if I was gonna tell.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: You're up.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Nah, you win. I, uh, I gotta run. It was great seeing you Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I went with Locke. I should have stayed with you.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: It's water under the bridge, man.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: I don't think we did the right thing, Jack. I think it wants us to come back.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: And it's going to do everything it can—
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK:  We're never going back!
Lost.Season04.Episode01 HURLEY: Never say never, dude.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: Are you thinking of Charlie?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Feels like a hundred years ago that we came out here together. How did this happen?
Lost.Season04.Episode01 KATE: Thunder's getting louder.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: That's not thunder.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 JACK: Come on.
Lost.Season04.Episode01 PARACHUTIST: Are you Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MAN 1: Sorry, Ron. Drone's got nothing but seafood at five thousand meters below. You picking up anything with yours?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 RON: Zip. Trying to get her a peek over this ridge as soon as I can. Sonar's picking up something now.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MAN 1: Hey, you wanna switch feeds?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 RON: Roger that.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 RON: I'm headed on a bearing of about 137 from the coordinates we pulled off our guy's map. But don't hold your breath.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MAN 1: Magnetometer's picking up a hell of a lot of anomalies around here.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 RON: Chests full of doubloons?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MAN 1: Keep dreaming, Ron. Let's swing round to the next grid and recalibrate.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MAN 1: Are you getting this?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 RON: What, what's up?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MAN 1: It's... It's an airplane. Oh my god, it's Oceanic 815.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 NEWSCASTER: This haunting footage comes to us from the Christiane I, a salvage vehicle in the Indian Ocean. For more than two months, it's been scouring the depths of the Sunda Trench off Bali, in search of the remains of sunken trading ships. Late last night, the Christiane deployed two remotely operated vehicles, or ROVs, that verified what the National Transportation Safety Board had long feared, that the commercial...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 WOMAN 1: How do you want your eggs, Dan? So what happened, they find that missing plane? Dan? Dan? Dan, why are you so upset?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: I don't know.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 WOMAN 2: I can't find my vest!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MAN 2: Check under your seat!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 WOMAN 2: I already did!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 PILOT: Get ready!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MAN 2: Here, just take mine!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 PILOT: Everybody out now!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MAN 2: Hey, genius, go!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: No!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MAN 2: Go!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: No!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Hey there. Are you Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Yeah, I'm Jack. Who are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: I'm Daniel Faraday. I'm here to rescue you.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Hey, Dan, the chopper, how many of you were on it?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Er, four, including me.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: So what happened to the rest of them?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Yeah, yeah, I, er, I have no idea, I dunno how many were able to get out before it went down, I just, I jumped and I lost my, er, what do you call it, my pack, and my phone was in my pack, if I had my phone, I would just, er...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: We have a phone.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: You have a phone.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MINKOWSKI: Minkowski.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Hey, George. It's Daniel.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MINKOWSKI: Dan, the chopper comm went dead, what the hell happened up there?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Yeah, I dunno, George, there was an electrical storm, all the instruments, they... I think they went down. But listen, I made contact with some of the survivors, and we were just, er...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MINKOWSKI: Dan, am I on speaker?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL:  Would you give me just one sec?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: Don't worry. Naomi covered for us. They don't know what Locke did to her.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: You sure about that?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL:  Okay, so the boat hasn't heard from anybody else yet, but, er, their GPS transponders, my team and I are all wearing these, the transponders will send the locations back to the ship, and then the ship will send all the locations back into the phones. Er, oh, there we are, there's my signal right there, and hopefully we'll get the signals for the rest of the team soon. Will you help me find 'em?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Absolutely.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Okay, thank you. Hey, where are the rest of your people?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: Most of them are back at the beach.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Most of them?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 HURLEY: Dude. What's wrong with you? You're gonna get struck by lightning.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: The storm's about to pass, Hugo.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 HURLEY: It's a friggin' monsoon, we gotta...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Let's go.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: Why are you going East? Thought you said the Barracks were due South.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Because, James, we have to make a little detour first.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: Detour to what?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: There's a cabin I have to go to.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 HURLEY: I thought the cabin was back that way.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: What did you say, Hugo?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 HURLEY: I, er, thought you were talking about the airplane cabin.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: Why are we wasting our time going to some shack, anyway?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Because we're supposed to.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: Right. Like you were supposed to throw a knife into that Naomi chick's back.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE:  Uh-huh.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: You mind telling us who you're getting your orders from, Colonel Kurtz?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: I got 'em from Walt.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JULIET: Jack still isn't back. Anything?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAYID: No. But it's a big Island. The freighter could be approaching from the other side.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JULIET: That's the spirit.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAYID: Juliet, you lived amongst the Others. Why would Ben say the people coming here intend to do us harm?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JULIET: Because he's a liar. And he's trying to scare us, that's what Ben does. Or, because the people coming here intend to do us harm. How many guns do you have left?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: Hey. That from your chopper?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Er, yeah yeah yeah, that, er, they had to reduce the weight load when we started going down. I  guess that's why they pushed me out.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: What's this for?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Erm, I'm not in charge of packing, so...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: You're not, huh?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: We should, er...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Hey, Daniel, why did you bring the gun?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Er, as a precaution.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Precaution against what?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Er, okay, see, erm, rescuing you and your people. Can't really say it's our primary objective.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Then what is?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: It's Miles, it's Miles, come on!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: What the hell do you mean you saw Walt? In a dream?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: No dream, it was Walt. Only, taller.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: Taller? What, like a giant? Okay, what exactly did Walt tell you?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: He said I had work to do. That I had to stop this woman, Naomi, from bringing the rest of her people here.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: What, you didn't ask any follow-up questions?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Ben had shot me and left me for dead. Walt saved my life, so I pretty much took him at his word.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: He shot you? Yet here you are fit as a fiddle tromping through the jungle.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: The bullet went in one side, came out the other. I'd probably be dead if I still had a kidney there. Anything else?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Down there. Hey, Miles! Miles!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: He dead?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Back up, handsome.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Hey, whoa whoa whoa, Miles! Take it easy, it's okay! They're here to help us. It's okay, Miles, they're just trying to help.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Hey! Back away from him! Hands where I can see 'em!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Kate, it's alright, it's okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: So you're Kate. You wanna tell me where Naomi is?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Naomi, the woman you killed. Where is she?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CAR RADIO: ...Oceanic 815, it can only be described as the worst case scenario. With the plane accounted for, and a salvage mission unlikely, authorities are confirming all three hundred and twenty-four passengers dead.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Ms Gardner? I'm Miles Straume. We spoke on the phone earlier.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 GARDNER: Oh oh oh, please come in.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Which room is it?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 GARDNER: It's upstairs at the end of the hall.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: I get paid in advance. Two hundred, cash only.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 GARDNER: You told me a hundred over...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES:  That was before my buddy at the police station told me your grandson was murdered. It's gonna be two hundred.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 GARDNER: Fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: No matter what you hear, don't come up.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: You're not doing your grandmother any good staying here, man. You're causing her a lot of pain. I wanna go downstairs and tell her you've gone, but the only way I'm gonna be able to do that is if you tell me where it is. So where is it?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: You can go now.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 GARDNER: Did it work?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Yeah. He's at peace now.  Here, you get a refund, half off. Wasn't as tricky as I thought.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 GARDNER: Thank you. Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Miles, Miles, hey, hey, hey, what you doing? What are you doing? These are good people.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Then why'd Naomi use the damn code? Yeah, you remember when she said tell my sister I love her, well she doesn't have a sister. That's what we're supposed to say if we get captured, have a gun to our heads. Like right now, Jack here would say tell my sister I love her, you get it?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: We didn't kill your friend.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Then take me to her body.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Miles, what about Charlotte, what about Frank?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Take me to Naomi!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: Listen, Naomi was killed, but not by us, it was, it was a man by the name of John Locke. He's not with us anymore.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Kate, seriously, if I have to ask you again...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: Even if I took you to her body you wouldn't know what happened...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: I'll know! Now take me to her body.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: Alex. Alex, hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 ALEX: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: Something I need to tell you.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KARL: Keep your mouth shut, Mr. Linus.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN:  Karl! Now, if you're gonna sleep with my daughter, I insist you call me Ben.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: Easy, kid, guy's just trying to get in your head. Go take a walk or something.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: Mind if I ask you a question, James?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: Yeah, I do.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: Why'd you leave Kate behind?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: Wasting your time, Yoda.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: I know it's not pleasant, but, let's face it, you really don't stand a chance now...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: Chance of what?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: James. Look at yourself. Yes, on this Island you're brave, daring, handsome, you're someone, but if you left with them, back in the real-world a low-life scam artist like you could never compete with a first class surgeon. I think Kate was really upset when you made your choice to come with us. Thank god she has Jack there to comfort-
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: James! Don't!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: Don't what! Anyone wanna tell me why we're keeping this guy alive?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: We're keeping him alive because he's been on this Island a lot longer than any of us. Because he has information we need. And because apart from his mouth, he's completely harmless.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: His mouth put that hole in your gut?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Okay, James. Let's execute him, right here, right now, in front of his daughter.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: It's only a matter of time before he gets us, Johnny, and I bet he's already figured out how he's gonna do it. So you walk him.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: What is he doing?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: The light is strange out here, isn't it? It's kinda, like, it doesn't scatter quite right.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: Dan, your name's Dan, right? Listen, Dan. I know that you don't want anybody to get hurt, right? So why don't you just put that away? 
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Er, because, erm, Miles would kill me.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: We're just trying to help.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Kate, you're wasting your breath. Why don't we just let this play out and see what happens, okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: They didn't kill her. Happened like they said it did.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: It's Charlotte, only three kilometers from here.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Alright then, let's go get her.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: I said let's go.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: You need to put the guns down.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Put the guns down.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Now why would I do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Because our friends are out in the jungle right now holding a gun at your head, and his head. So I'm gonna forget about the misunderstanding. Just put the guns down.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Come on, how stupid do you think I-
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: I dunno, Miles, how stupid are ya?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 WOMAN: How many different languages do you have to read that in before you believe it's true?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: How many different languages are there?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 WOMAN: He wants to know if we're lost.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Remind him the people in our line of work are terrible at keeping secrets. I know about the dig.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 WOMAN: He says the site is closed.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Then tell him to open it.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 WOMAN: Dinosaur?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Not by a few million years. It's an Ursus maritimus.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 WOMAN: Wait, Ursus as in bear?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: As in polar bear.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 WOMAN: Charlotte, we're in the desert. This is a hoax, right?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 WOMAN: He wants to know what you're doing with the hammer.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Excavating.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 WOMAN: Is that a collar?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Hi.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Hi yourself.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JULIET: We were worried when you didn't get back so we went out to the cockpit and tracked you from there.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Thanks for that, for what it's worth.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JULIET: Don't mention it.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: Someone could have told me that the cavalry were here.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: I gave you that... wink.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAYID: What are your names?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Er, I'm Daniel Faraday, and this is Miles...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Don't tell him my last name.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: I guess it's just Miles.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAYID: What do you do for a living, Daniel?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: I'm a physicist. Well, I guess you could call me a physicist, I don't really like being pigeon-holed into one...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Dan, I swear to God, you say one more word, I'm gonna break your fingers.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAYID: And what do you do, Miles?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: I collect soil samples.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAYID: Oh, that's nice. Well, maybe you can help me. You say you're not here on a rescue mission, and the world at large believes us to be dead. But here we are alive and well, and you don't seem remotely surprised to see us.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES:  Oh my God, you guys were on Oceanic Flight 815! Wow! That better?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: I can't believe you're alive. How many of you are there?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 HURLEY: Why do you wanna know?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Why wouldn't I wanna know?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 HURLEY: Forty-eight of us survived the crash, that's not counting the tail-section. They're pretty much all dead now...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Hugo.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: So you've all been living here this entire time.  Is that your baby?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CLAIRE: Yeah, this is Aaron.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Did you have him here on the Island?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CLAIRE:  Mmhmm.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: That's amazing.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Well, I've about a million more questions I want to ask you, but they can wait until we get you back to the freighter. We all got one of these transponders, so if we just sit tight, they're gonna be here soon, okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: This team of yours, how many of you are there?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Four, including me.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: And what happened to your helicopter?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: I dunno, the pilot was trying to put it down.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Where?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: I dunno. I had to jump, it was chaos. I'm lucky to be alive.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Get up, you're coming with us.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Wha- What? We need to stay where we are so they can find us.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: See, there's your problem. We don't wanna be found.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: I wouldn't mess around with that if I were you.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAYID: It can't hurt to try and call someone else.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Oh, it can hurt.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: What'd you do?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAYID: I didn't do anything.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAYID: Your friend, Charlotte, she's moving. And she's moving fast.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: She's running from something.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAYID: According to this, she's right here.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Charlotte! Charlotte!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: Over there, over there.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: Vincent.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Locke's got her.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 TV REPORTER: We wanna caution our viewers that the images they are about to see are graphic in nature. Viewer discretion is advised. Authorities have released dramatic footage of the sunken remains of Oceanic Flight 815. The National Transportation Safety Board has set up a hotline for family members of the Oceanic victims. The NTSB has begun the victim identification process.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 TV REPORTER: We have confirmation that this is the pilot, Captain Seth Norris. In a statement, the NTSB said that quote...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 TV REPORTER: ...recovery of the bodies will be next to impossible. We can only hope that identification will provide closure to the families of the victims. Unquote.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FEMALE OPERATOR: National Transportation Safety Board, Oceanic hotline.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: Yeah, let me speak to your supervisor.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FEMALE OPERATOR: Yes, sir, are you a family member of the deceased?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: No I'm not, but I got some information on the crash, may I please speak to your supervisor.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FEMALE OPERATOR: Sir, if you could just tell me...
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: Look, I'm staring at the television right now, you're broadcasting footage of the wreckage and saying that that's the pilot Seth Norris.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FEMALE OPERATOR: Yes, sir?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: Well, that's not him.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FEMALE OPERATOR:  Please hold.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MALE VOICE: Who am I speaking with?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: Doesn't matter who I am, you're showing footage of Seth Norris and that's not him. Listen, this guy married his high school sweetheart at nineteen, he always wore his wedding ring and I'm telling you there's no ring on that body.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MALE VOICE: Sir, it's likely the ring fell off.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: I'm telling you, that is not him.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MALE VOICE: How exactly is it that you know all about Captain Norris?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: Because I was supposed to be flying Oceanic 815 on that day.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: That's them. That's somebody from my team.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: What's wrong with you people? We're here because of you. I just almost died jumping out of a helicopter because you called us for help.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 HURLEY: Maybe we should go see who launched that flare.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CLAIRE: Yeah, I mean, they could be hurt, John.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: She's lying. And whatever they came for it, isn't us. We keep moving forwards as planned.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: Sure! Who are we to argue with taller ghost Walt?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: You know what? You people do whatever you want.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: I want you to come with us.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: I'm not asking for permission, and if you think you're gonna bloody stop me from getting to my-!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: What did you do, you son of a bitch.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE:  Vest.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Vest. Vest.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Is he alive?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: I've got a pulse.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Frank? Frank? Hey, hey. Frank?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: What happened?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: We got struck by lightning.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Frank, where's Charlotte?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: She bailed out just before we went down. I don't know where she is.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Where's the chopper?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: I saw a cow.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Hey, hey, Lapidus, where's the chopper? Where did it crash?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: Crash? The hell kind of pilot do you think I am? I put her down safe and sound, right over there.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 NAOMI: So this is the team.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MATTHEW: You familiarized yourself with their profiles?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 NAOMI: Unfortunately, yes. With respect, these are the wrong people for a mission like this. None of them have field experience, military training.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 NAOMI: You can't just drop them in unprotected. It'll be a disaster.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MATTHEW: They're not unprotected, they have you.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 NAOMI: There's only so much I can do.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MATTHEW: Your modesty is positively charming.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 NAOMI: This is a high risk covert op in unstable territory. It's dodgy enough without having to babysit a headcase, ghost buster, anthropologist and a drunk.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MATTHEW: To be fair, he's also a pretty good pilot.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 NAOMI: It's madness. What if we find survivors from 815?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MATTHEW: There were no survivors.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 NAOMI: I know, but what if there are survivors?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MATTHEW: There were no survivors of Oceanic 815. Don't ask questions, just do what you were hired for. Every member of this team was selected for a specific purpose. Everything relies on you getting them in, getting them out, and preventing anyone from getting killed. Think you can do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 NAOMI: Sure. Why not?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Well?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAYID: There's some minor damage, but the mechanical systems are intact.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: So it'll fly then?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAYID: Absolutely.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Can I have the phone now?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Tell you what, I'll give you the phone if you tell me what you people are doing here.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: I'll tell you what we're doing here if you give me the phone.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Don't say anything about your sister.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 WOMAN: Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Regina, it's Miles. I need to talk to Minkowski.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 REGINA: Minkowski can't come to the phone right now.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: It's important, go get him.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 REGINA: Miles, he can't come to the phone right now.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Alright, have him call me when he can.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 REGINA: I gotta go.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Whoa whoa whoa, what are you doing with her?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: We're taking her with us.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: What's the point? That's not Naomi, it's just meat.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIEL: Miles, we can't just leave her here.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK:  Miles is right. We burned up most of the damned fuel flying around that storm. We barely got enough to get back to the freighter, we're not carrying any unnecessary weight. I'll take her on the next run. I promise, Dan.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: There's a blanket over there by my backpack, would you get it?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: Look as bad as it feels?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JULIET: How bad does it feel?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK:  What's your name again?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JULIET: Juliet.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: Juliet. Juliet what?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JULIET: Juliet Burke.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: Juliet Burke. You weren't on that plane, were you?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: Miles!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Yeah?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: This is Juliet, and she was not on the plane.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: What? You sure?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 FRANK: You know how many times I studied that damn manifest? Believe me there's no Juliet Burke on that plane. She's a native.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES:  Really... where is he?!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JACK: Back off!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 JULIET: Where's who?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: You wanna know why we're here? I'll tell you why we're here!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: We're here for Benjamin Linus.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 MILES: Now where is he?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: James, listen to me! Please!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: Keep your mouth shut!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE:  You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: I feel like I've got a cinder block on my chest, but I'll survive.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: I'm sorry you got shot. I didn't intend for that to happen.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Really? Because it seemed like you were about to shoot me yourself.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: What good would you be to me dead?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CHARLOTTE:  I feel much more comfortable now. Thanks.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: I guess this is the part where I'm supposed to say I told you so.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: James, I stand corrected.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: You want me to do it?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: No, it's my mess, I'll clean it up.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 ALEX: No, wait!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Danielle, you should escort Alex away from here.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 ALEX: No, no!
Lost.Season04.Episode02 DANIELLE: Let's go. Come on, Alex.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 KARL: She's right, let's go.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Anyone who doesn't want to see this should leave now.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 CLAIRE: John, we should talk about this.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Claire, what if one of those bullets had hit you or the baby?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: John, listen. I have information that you need. I have answers.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE:  What is the Monster?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: The black smoke, the Monster, what is it?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: I don't know.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE: Then goodbye, Benjamin.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: Her name is Charlotte Lewis! Charlotte Staples Lewis. Born July second, nineteen seventy-nine, Essex, England. Parents David and Jeanette. Eldest of three, all girls. She was raised in Bromsgrove. Did her undergraduate studies at Kent. Took her PhD in Cultural Anthropology at Oxford. She's here with two other team members and a pilot. Their names Daniel Faraday, Miles Straume, and Frank Lapidus.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: Your instinct was right, John. These people are a threat, and if you shoot me you'll never know how great a threat they were. Because I know what they're doing here. I know what they want.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 SAWYER: What do they want?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: Me, James, they want me.
Lost.Season04.Episode02 LOCKE:  How do you know all this?
Lost.Season04.Episode02 BEN: Because I have a man on their boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: Did Ben ever mention knowing anyone off the island? You're sure of that?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JULIET: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: Look, this is real simple. Do you know where he is or don't you?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK:  What do you want with him?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES:  I want to locate him.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: The people who hired me told me his name’s Benjamin Linus, I don't know anything else. They gave me the picture, that's all they told me.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES:  They told me "find him," and for what they're paying me I don't need to know anything else, do you?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK:  Okay, you want Ben. He's with Locke, and your friend—
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES:  Charlotte.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK:  Charlotte. John's got her, too. And we know where they're headed.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES:  Locke’s the guy who killed Naomi. Give me back my gun, Shepherd.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK:  You want your gun back? I want answers.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK:  You don’t trust me, I don't trust you.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: You're supposed to be dead. But am I asking a million questions? No. We both have the same problem, this Locke guy.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: Even if Locke has your friend, you can’t just waltz in there and grab her. They're armed.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES:  Well how 'bout that? So are we! So why don't we move out?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: You're not going anywhere.  Will that helicopter fly?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: It's what she does.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Then you can take me to your ship.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: Sayid, wait a second.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: We did call these people to get us off this island, didn't we?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Well?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: We burned a lot of fuel coming in, it can't carry much weight. I'll take three of you.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: In case you zoned out while you were tweezing your goatee, one of these yahoos took Charlotte prisoner.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I can bring her back. Safely. And if I do, will you take me to the ship?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Absolutely. You bring Charlotte back safe, and I will take you off this island.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 1:  Good morning.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Good morning.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 1:  Long walk to the next hole. Want a ride?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Thank you, but no. My ball is right here.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 1: You know, you are the first person I have seen out here all morning.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I believe we are paying quite a premium for that kind of privacy.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 1: That we are.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 1: Is this your first time in the Seychelles? Uh-uh, I'd use the 5-iron.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I think I'll stick with the 7.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 1: Tell you what. Fifty Euros says mine goes closer to the pin with a 5.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Let's make it 100.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 1: Eccelente. Amazing, huh? How a wager makes just about anything more fun.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 1: Not bad, not bad.  So, what do you do for a living, my friend?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I do nothing.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 1: Nothing? That doesn't pay for a vacation here.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I was the recipient of a large settlement.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 1: Corporate merger?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Actually, a plane crash. Oceanic Airlines flight 8-1-5. I'm Sayid Jarrah, one of the Oceanic Six.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 1: Ah, that's— that's amazing. I remember reading all about it.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Take your shot, my friend.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: It appears you were right about the 5-iron.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 1: Well, uh, enjoy your round, don't worry about the wager. All in good fun.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: No, you won. Allow me to pay you.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN: No, it's fine. Thank you, it's—
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I insist, Mr. Avellino.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Ist frei? 
Lost.Season04.Episode03 WOMAN: Wohin möchten Sie gehen? 
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: "Is it free" was the full extent of my German.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 WOMAN:  What are you looking for?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I love Europe. Everyone speaks English.  I'm looking for Potsdamer Platz.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 WOMAN: You don't need a map. It's one block down right across the street.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 WOMAN: I'm Elsa.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Sayid.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 WAITER: Kann ich Ihnen etwas bringen? 
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  Could I have an espresso, please.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 WAITER: Ja, sofort. 
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: What sort of business brings you to Berlin?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I'm a headhunter. A corporate recruiter. What do you do?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: My employer is an economist. He works in emerging markets. Actually, I don't really understand what he does; which doesn't matter, since all I do is shop for him.  If this goes off, I'm at his side instantly. Which is wonderful, since he's only in Berlin once or twice a year.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Which is why you are enjoying a luxuriously long mid-day coffee.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: Yes.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  Danke. 
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: Do I... know you from somewhere?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I'll tell you exactly where you know me from... if you let me take you to dinner.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: Mm...  This is the restaurant you're taking me to tonight. 8:00. Well — if you can find it. 
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 2:  Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I made contact.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 2:  Good.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Take a look at this.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Naomi had it with her.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: She was looking for Desmond. Whatever their real agenda is, it's clear they're not sharing it. Maybe Desmond can shed some light on this.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: How long would it take to get to the beach and back?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JULIET: A couple of hours.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: You mind?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JULIET:  Anything I can do to help.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK:  Sayid, so how are we going to do this?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: You're not the best candidate for this kind of mission.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK:  And what kind of mission is that?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I'm going to make Locke release Charlotte. And I'm going to do it without any bloodshed.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: As opposed to the way I'd do it.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: The last time you encountered him, you put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  That's not good diplomacy.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: Hey, Jarrah, you think you're going after Charlotte without me?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Of course not.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES:  Oh. Well, good.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  Is there anything else?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: Yeah, give me my gun back.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  We leave in 10 minutes.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER: You ready to give us the name, Gizmo?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: He's not going to tell you who his spy is on their boat, James.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER: Yeah, why not?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: Because that's the only thing keeping him alive.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER: Well here's an idea: Why don't we take a gun, point it to his big toe, send that little piggy to market.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER:  And if he still doesn't want to tell us, we'll move on to the roast beef. Now why don’t we do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: Because then we'd have to carry him.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 CLAIRE: Hey, John, how much further is it? I need to feed Aaron.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: It should be here, the cabin.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY:  Maybe we got turned around. It could be anywhere.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE:  No, it was here.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER: Well, what's in this cabin that's so important anyway?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 BEN: John's looking for somebody to tell him what to do next.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: I guess I was mistaken. It doesn't matter, the plan's the same. We keep moving. The Barracks aren't far.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIELLE: If her team is with Jack's group, they know we're going to the Barracks.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER: Yeah, and Red here was wearing a vest. Which means her posse's gonna come expecting themselves a gun fight.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: If all they want is her, maybe we should just let her go? I mean, I thought we were just gonna go hide. Why do we need to take prisoners?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: We're keeping her because she’s gonna be valuable.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY:  How's she going to be valuable?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 CHARLOTTE: He means as a hostage, love.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: Nuh uh, no, that's not what I signed up for.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: What did you sign up for, Hugo?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: Look, I'm just saying that if we let her go, they'll look at is as a sign of good faith.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: They'll look at it as an act of foolishness, which is what it would be.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: I'm just trying to come up with some kind of compromise—
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: We're beyond compromise. And right now, Hugo, I'm making the decisions. Is that going to be a problem for you?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: Kinda sucks, huh?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: What's that?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: Being told not to come along.  Now you know what it feels like to be me.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: Does that mean I should wait 20 minutes and go anyway?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE:  Touché.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: You should go with them, Kate.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: Are you serious?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: What, don't you trust Sayid?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: I don't trust Locke.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: So what's preventing him from doing to me what he did to Naomi?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: Sawyer won't let him.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: Got room for one more?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: Oh, yeah, she gets a gun.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  Gun's a last resort, Kate.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: You give Locke that same speech?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: Hey. Let's move out.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Hey, this guy Sayid — where's he from?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: Iraq.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Iraq? He's just gonna go and work everything out? What was he, a diplomat?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK:  No. No, he was a torturer.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Naomi, were you close to her?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: Nope. Met her on the boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: You don't seem particularly affected by her death.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: Sure I'm affected. She was hot and I dug her accent.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: Nice.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: And this woman, Charlotte. You don't really care about her, do you?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: Define care.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: So much for camaraderie.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: Yeah, gee, who's the one going after one of their crash buddies with guns? Actually, I do care about Locke.  Maybe you can tell me how he managed to split your happy little family in half.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  There was a fundamental debate as to whether your people were coming to rescue us... or kill us.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: And which side did you land on?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I let you know when I decide. 
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: You look fantastic.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA:  This is why I wanted to take you to the opera.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: If a man can't wear his tuxedo by the fifth date, why bother?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: You know what? I'm not bringing it. If tonight's the night he calls, so be it.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I'll carry it. If he does call, I don't want you fired over me. You should tell your employer that there is newer technology.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: Well, I've tried. He's very old-fashioned. You know how bosses can be.  Do you have a boss?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Everyone has a boss, Elsa.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Come on, we don't want to be late.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: Why are you still here? When we met, you said you would only be in Berlin for one week.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: The job I'm on is proving harder to accomplish than I thought.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: Oh.  Right. I was hoping it was because of me.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Let's go. Strauss awaits.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: What's his story?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Daniel?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Couldn't tell ya. Half the stuff he says goes way over my head; the other half goes way, way over.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: Hey, uh, Frank? Could I, uh,  sorry to interrupt. May I please use the phone, just for a second?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: For what?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: I just wanna call Regina on the boat. I figured since we're waiting, I could just, you know, try to—
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: What is it, Daniel?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: I'd just like to do an experiment. Just, uh...
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Sure. You just keep it to that science stuff, alright?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: If Minkowski gets on there, you hang up right away.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: Yeah, thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 REGINA:  Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: Regina? Hey, hi, it's Dan. Hang on.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: Can you hear me?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 REGINA: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: Yeah, hang on.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: I'm all, yes,  I'm all set here, I have a fix. Are you locked in?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 REGINA: Getting your signal pretty clear.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: Oh, okay, great, then. OK. Fire the payload.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 REGINA: Payload away.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Don't sweat it. He does this kind of stuff on the boat all the time.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 REGINA: Forty kilometers to beacon. Thirty-five kilometers to beacon. Thirty kilometers to beacon. Twenty-five kilometers to beacon. Twenty kilometers to beacon.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 REGINA:  Fifteen kilometers to beacon. Ten kilometers to beacon.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: Regina?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 REGINA: Five kilometers to beacon.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: Huh.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 REGINA: Zero.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: I don't have it.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 REGINA: That's weird.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: That is far more than weird.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: What's with the swing set? These people have daycare?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE:  You think they're here yet?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Let's find out.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: It's coming from in there.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: Hurley, what happened?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY:  They left me.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: Locke's gone off the reservation, man. I mean, he took this one chick hostage, he said Walt was the one who told him to kill the other chick, and, and he—
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  Walt?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: Dude, don't ask. I was, like, just trying to argue with him, so he would just like, you know, chill, but—
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: How about you stop babbling and just tell us what happened to them? Where are they?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: Who are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: Where the hell did they go, Tubby?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: Oh, awesome. The ship sent us another Sawyer.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  Hurley, where did they go?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: Look, I guess they were too busy tying me up to tell me. I don't know.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: So they all left, all together?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: Yeah, they were freaked. Locke said the people on the ship were here to rescue Charlotte and then kill us.  So... are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: Not yet.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Did they say anything that suggested where they were going next?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: Um, Locke said they were gonna go by Ben's house before they took off.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Why would they go there?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY:  For all I know, they could have locked Ben up in a closet too.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MILES: Where's Ben's house?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: Mind if I ask you a question?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Shoot.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: The Red Sox really win the Series?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK:  Hey, don't get me started on that, alright? My dad's from the Bronx. I bleed Yankee blue.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK:  I can't believe it's been a hundred days since I've seen a game.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: Oh. It's the payload!  It's finally here.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: What is that?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: It's a rocket.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: Oh, no, no.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL:  Thirty-one minutes.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: Oh, no. This is not good.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Your friends are back.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DESMOND: Well... look at that. 
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Look for anything that shows where they might have gone. I'll start in here.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: Sayid!
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: Don't worry, Kate's fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: Good job, Hugo.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: Sorry, dude.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIELLE: Sorry, Sayid, nothing personal.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Where's Locke?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: He's talking to that angry Chinese guy.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  I'm not going to hurt you, Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 HURLEY: Yeah... I saw you snap that guy's neck with that break dancing thing you do with your legs. I think I'll hang back here.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 BEN: Well... I guess they're running out of jail space.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 BEN: I lost a dollar, you know.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: How did you manage that?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 BEN: I bet John that you wouldn't be stupid enough to fall for your friend as bait.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: What do you know about friendship?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 BEN: I know it's no use having friends you can't trust.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: So what, I'm your prisoner?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER: If that sorta thing turns you on.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: What are you doing here with Locke?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER:  I'm not with him.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: Yeah, you are, James.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER: Then what are you doing with Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: I went with Jack because I believe he can get us off this island.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER: I guess that's the difference between us.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER:  I ain't looking to leave.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: Why not?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER:  'Cause, I ain't got nothin' back there for me.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE:  And what's here that's so much better?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER: Why do you want to go back, Kate? Seem to recall you being shuttled off to jail before we landed here. So if you think there's anything waiting for you back home other than handcuffs, then you really don’t know how the world works. Look around us, Freckles. We've got roofs over our heads. Electricity, showers, beds.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 KATE: Yeah, how long, Sawyer? How long do you think we can play house?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAWYER:  Why don't we find out? 
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: Iced tea.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: I thought you might be thirsty.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 BEN:  I'm thirsty.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: I'm sorry about, um, all the theatrics, but uh, I didn't know how many of you there'd be, or whether you'd be armed. I covered my bases. 
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: What have you done with Miles and Kate?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: Kate's with Sawyer. And Miles is somewhere else.  He's fine. All I did was ask him some questions.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Did he answer any?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Did you have more luck with the woman you captured?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: Not particularly.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Then why don't you turn her over to me?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: Why would I do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I agree that these people are liars and they're certainly not here to rescue us. But if I return safely with Charlotte, they'll take me to their ship. It's our best chance of finding out who they are and what they really want.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: Well, then, I can save you a lot of trouble, Sayid, because Ben says he's got a spy on the boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Who?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 BEN: It's a secret.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Forgive me, but the day I start trusting him is the day I would have sold my soul. Give me Charlotte! Allow me to do things my way. Or war is coming, which we will both be powerless to stop.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 LOCKE: Why would I give you Charlotte for nothing?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Oh, I think you misunderstood me. I never expected you to give her to me for nothing. 
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: Should we get dressed?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  No.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA:  Well,  we're going to have to get out of this bed at a certain point.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Why?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: Well, for one thing, because I know that eventually you're going to have to go to that job of yours — you know, the one that you never talk about.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: There's nothing to talk about, it's just a job.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: I know nothing about you. I understand you don't want to talk about the crash, what happened to you. But what about life now, what about you? That's what you do when you're in love, right?  You...
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: In love?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Okay. No more secrets. What do you want to know?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: He's here. My boss. I, um, I have to go.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Now? Where?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: Hotel Adlon. Where's my dress?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Elsa? You have to leave Berlin.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: You can't be here anymore.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: What do you mean? Why would I—
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: People will be asking questions soon. About what happened to your employer. And you can't be around to answer them.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: My employer? This... this is about my boss? Who are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: This has nothing to do with how—
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: The café? You meant to meet me there? You used me to get to my boss. What did you say, "people will ask what happened to him"?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: It's best you don't know.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: You gonna kill him? You're gonna kill him?!  Do you even know him?!
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: His name is on a list.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: A list?! What list?! You have a list?!
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: It's my employer's.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: And who is that?!
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  It doesn't matter who he is!
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: You just kill people 'cause they're on a list? Innocent people?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: The man you are working for is not an economist.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA:  You were supposed to page me at ten-thirty, not ten.  No, I didn't kill him. He's not going to give up the name now.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA:  Why should I keep him alive? No. He had no idea. All right, all right. I'll bring him to you. Leave the hotel. I'll meet you at the safe house.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 ELSA: What do you think you're do—
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DESMOND: Hey. I'm gonna ask you one last time. Why was Naomi carrying this picture of me?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Look, man, you gotta understand something. She was senior management. It's not like we hung around the cafeteria together. She stayed on her own.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DESMOND: Look, Naomi told me you people were hired by her!  So you look me right in the eye and tell me you've never seen or heard of Penelope Widmore.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DESMOND: Fine. You don't want to tell me the truth; I'll find someone who will. See, when that takes off,  I'm on it.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JULIET: He's back.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: Where's Kate?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: She decided to stay.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: What happened to Miles?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I traded him.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Traded him?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I promised you Charlotte, here she is.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: You cheated.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Did I?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Yes, you did. Lucky for you that guy's nothing but a pain in my ass.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 CHARLOTTE: Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: You all right?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 CHARLOTTE: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: All right. That gives us room for one more. Charlotte?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 CHARLOTTE:  Go back? With all the fun I'm having here? No, I've got work to do.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Seat's yours if you want it, Daniel.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL: I... no, thank you. I think I should probably just stay with Charlotte.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: All right.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 DANIEL:  Hey, Frank. Frank?  Just one thing. Just be sure that you follow the same exact bearing that we came in on. No matter what. By that, I mean no matter what. Just — just stay on it.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Roger that.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: Be careful.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: I don't have to talk you out of coming.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: As much as I like helicopter rides, I think you got this one under control.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: Wish me luck.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 JACK: Good luck. Send me a postcard.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: You said we have room for one more?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 FRANK: Yeah, why?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: We should bring Naomi home.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 2: Take your shirt off.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 2: Is she dead?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID:  Yes.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 2: Why didn't she kill you?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: She was trying to get information from me.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 2: What sort of information?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: She wanted to know who I worked for. She wanted to know about you.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 MAN 2: Of course she did.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 BEN: Why are you crying? Because it hurts? Or because you were stupid enough to care for her? These people don't deserve our sympathies. Need I remind you what they did the last time you thought with your heart instead of your gun?
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: You used that to recruit me into killing for you.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 BEN: Do you want to protect your friends or not, Sayid? I have another name for you.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 SAYID: But they know I'm after them now.
Lost.Season04.Episode03 BEN: Good.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: These are the last two eggs.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN: From my own bookshelf.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Help you pass the time.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN:  I've already read it. 
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: You might catch something you missed the second time around.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN:  Why did you move me from the rec room down here?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: I wanted you under my own roof.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN:  Where are you keeping your other prisoner? Miles, is it?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN:  Oh, you don't wanna share.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Actually, I was hoping you would share, Ben. Seeing as you claim to have a spy on his ship.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN:  I feel for you, John. I really do. You keep hitting dead ends.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN:  You couldn't find the cabin, you can't make contact with Jacob — you're so desperate to figure out what to do next, you're even asking me for help. So here we are, just like old times. Except I'm locked in a different room, and you're more lost than you ever were.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: I know what you're trying to do. It's not going to work.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN: Excellent, John! You're evolving!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Done with your breakfast?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: What was that all about?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: Who knows? It's Locke.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Mornin', ladies.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: Good morning.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Mornin'.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Mmm, the coffee smells good.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: Well, why don't I go make you a cup?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Kinda weird, ain't it? Sittin' on porches, drinking coffee out of mugs? By the way, I found some clothes about your size, in the closet. So after I kick out Hugo—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I'm not moving in with you, James.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Well. Then why did you stay?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: That's none of your business.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Oh, you got a secret agenda, huh? Well, if you're spying for Jack—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I'm not spying for anyone.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: So why don't you tell me why—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Because I don't trust you.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: This is about the pregnancy.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: James?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Go home.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Okay, fine. See you later then.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: You ready?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Is there a back entrance?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Yeah, but you're going in the front door, with your head held high, okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Yeah. Okay. Let's do this.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Let us through. Folks, we're not making any statements or answering any questions right now. Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEARDED MAN IN CROWD: We hate you!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BAILIFF: The people vs. Katherine Anne Austen, the honorable Arthur Galzethron presiding.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE GALZETHRON: Bailiff will read the counts. Will the defendant please rise?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BAILIFF: Katherine Anne Austen, you are charged with fraud, arson, assault on a federal officer, assault with a deadly weapon, grand larceny, grand theft auto, and murder in the first degree. Ms. Austen, how do you plead?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Not guilty.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE: Thus entered. I will now hear the argument on the bail.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA: Your honor, we are requesting that the defendant be remanded into custody for the duration of the trial.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Your honor, my client's been free pending arraignment, now suddenly she's a flight risk?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA: She's the very definition of a flight risk.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: She is one of the most recognizable faces in America. Where's she going to run?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE: Ms. Austen, based on your prior history, I'm inclined to agree with the people. You are hereby remanded into federal custody for the duration of your trial.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Your honor—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE: Bailiff, please take the defendant into custody.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Sorry.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JIN: Al-ber-kerke.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SUN: Too hot.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JIN: New York.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SUN: Too many people.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JIN: 서울보다 더 많아? 
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SUN: 서울이 어때서요?  
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JIN: 자기야, 이제 우리는 이 섬을 곧 떠날텐데... 
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JIN:  I learn English...for you...to live...in...America.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SUN: 글쎄... 나는... 내 아기는 내가 자란 한국에서 키우고 싶어요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JIN: 우리 애기. 
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK:  This is, uh, Charlotte, and Dan. Their helicopter already took Sayid and Desmond back to their freighter. They can make arrangements to get all of us off this island.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SUN: Where's Kate?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK:  She stayed with Locke.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Hello, Kate.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: You got blood...
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: I just killed a chicken. What can I do for you?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I want to talk to Miles. Where are you keeping him?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Why do you need to talk to him?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: It's personal.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: And what gives you the right to decide whether or not—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: You may think this is a democracy, Kate, because of the way Jack ran things, but this is not a democracy.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Then I guess that makes it a dictatorship.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: If I was a dictator, I would just shoot you and go about my day. Dinner's at six if you're hungry.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Hey Hurley! You bringing that to Miles?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 HURLEY: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Well, Locke asked me to do it.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 HURLEY: Cool. That dude creeps me out.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: He's still in the rec room, right?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 HURLEY: No, we moved him to the boathouse that... You just totally Scooby-Dood me, didn't you.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Sorry.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 HURLEY: You're not going to let him go, are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: No. No, I promise.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 HURLEY: Just don't tell Locke it was me.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: So the Arab traded you too, huh?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Do you know who I am?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: Excuse me?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Do you know who I am. Do you know what I did?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: What did you do?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Answer the question.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: Okay. I'll tell you what you wanna know. But you gotta do something for me first.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I'm not letting you go.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: I don't wanna be let go. I'm exactly where I wanna be. What I want, is one minute of someone's time. You bring him to me, and I will tell you everything I know about you.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Who?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: Who do you think?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Yeah, I'm fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Listen. The D.A.'s decided to try this case herself. Which means they're gonna do the full-court press. Now we need to start talking about cutting a deal.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: What kind of deal?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Honestly, my best guess, I'd say...she'll take a fifteen year sentence, and you serve seven.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: No way.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: If you go to trial, Kate, you're looking at twenty years on each count, not to mention a life sentence on the murder charge.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Kate, you confessed to your mother that you killed your father. And now, she's their star witness. So you tell me, what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to win this thing?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Put me on the stand.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: And take a chance with the D.A. crossing you, no. The way I see, we've got one shot at this.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: What's that?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: We make it about character. Not about what you did or didn't do, but about who you are.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: What do you mean who I am?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: I want him in the courtroom.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Absolutely not.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: We need him, Kate. It will generate tremendous sympathy—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Duncan, listen to me. You are not bringing him in here. Alright, you want to make this about me, about my character, fine. You are not using my son.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JULIET: Maybe you should try a number other than the boat, like 911.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SUN: What's wrong?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Nothing. I'm just having some trouble getting a hold of their boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SUN: You haven't heard from Sayid? You said they left yesterday!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: And I'm sure they're fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SUN: What if Locke was right? What if these people are here to hurt us?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Locke has no idea what he's doing.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SUN:  Then why is Kate with him?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: You sure he's got Ben in the basement?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: Uh-huh. I saw Rousseau take him in there last night.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Does Locke ever go out?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: No, he's been in there cooking all day. He invited us all over for dinner.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: Oh, can you get Aaron for me?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE:  Just pick him up and rock him a little bit.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Um...yeah, I'm just not very good with babies. I wouldn't want him to get more upset.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: Here, I got it.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: Ohhh...it's okay. There we go, muffin. There we go.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: You're so good with him.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: Just...the last thing I thought I'd be good at was being a mum. You know, you should try it sometime.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BAILIFF: Please rise.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BAILIFF: Court is now in session. Please be seated.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN:  Don't fire me, okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN:  We got killed in the opening. I had to do this.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE: Does the defense have a witness?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Yes we do, your honor. The defense calls Dr. Jack Shephard to the witness stand.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA: Your honor, I'd like to renew my objection to this witness on the basis of relevance.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE: And I'm going to renew my overruling of your objection. You have to be aware that this witness did not meet the defendant until after the alleged crimes she's been charged with. He is to be viewed as a character witness only. Proceed.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BALIFF: Please raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Dr. Shephard. Could you please tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if there are any of you who don't read the newspapers or the internet or watch television, how you met the defendant?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Um... on September 22, 2004, Kate uh, Ms. Austen, and I were both passengers on Oceanic Flight 815, which crash-landed on an island in the South Pacific.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Were you aware that Ms. Austen was a fugitive being transported by a United States marshal on that flight to Los Angeles for trial?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: I did learn that eventually, yes.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: From the U.S. Marshal?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: No, the marshal died in the crash. I never spoke to him. Ms. Austen told me.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Did you ever ask her if she was guilty?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: No. Never.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Well, that seems like a reasonable question. Why not?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: I just assumed that there had been some kind of mistake.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: And why would you think that?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Only eight of us survived the crash. We landed in the water. I was hurt, pretty badly. In fact, if it weren't for her, I would have never made it to the shore. She took care of me. She took care of all of us. She — she gave us first aid, water, found food, made shelter. She tried to save the other two, but they didn't—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Stop.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE:  Ms. Austen, please sit down.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: This has nothing to do with... with anything. This is my trial, and I don't want him to say anything else.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: That's fine. I have no more questions, your honor.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE: Ms. Dunbrook, bear witness.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA: That was very moving, Dr. Shephard. I only have one question for you. Do you love the defendant?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Objection!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE: You opened this door, Mr. Forrester, I'm going to allow it.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA: Doctor Shephard, do you love Ms. Austen?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: No. Not anymore.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 HURLEY: So... what do you wanna watch? Xanadu or Satan's Doom?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: I'm reading.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 TV:  "They call it Xanadu..."
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Turn that thing down, dammit!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 HURLEY: Sorry.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Can I come in?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Sure. I believe you know my roommate.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Hey Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 HURLEY: Hey Kate.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Got something in your eye, Hugo?  Why don't we talk in the kitchen?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: I know it's in a box, but, uh, it's pretty damn good wine. I tested it. So, how's life in Casa de Claire? Baby Aaron keeping you up all night?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: No, no, he's a good sleeper.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Good for you.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: You are terrible at this, Freckles.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Terrible at what?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: You already said you didn't stay behind for me. So at least be woman enough to tell me you want to use me for something.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I want to use you for something.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: See? Wasn't that hard. For what?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: For Ben. I want you to help me bust him out.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Wanna play some backgammon?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: You're on.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Do you think I know what I'm doing?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Huh?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Do you regret following me out here? Are you worried about what we should do next?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: All I know is that I'd be a lot more worried if I was sitting on that beach.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: And the rest of the group, what are they saying?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: I think they're saying "Baa."
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER:  That's the nice thing about sheep. They're predictable. But I ain't so sure about Kate.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: What do you mean?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: I need your word you ain't going to do nothing to her.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Why would I do anything to her?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Just give me your word, John.  You know what? Forget it.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: No, no, no, alright. You have my word.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: She came to me about an hour ago. Said she wanted my help busting Ben out of your basement.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: She talked to that guy... Bruce Lee from the freighter, the guy you've got locked up. He told her to bring Ben down to him for a chat.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: No, that's impossible. She doesn't even know where Miles is.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: What, the boathouse down by the dock? If Hugo knows, everybody knows.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Are you sure about this?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Yeah, I'm sure.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are you going with that?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Whatever Miles has to say to Ben, he can say to me.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Come on.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: You got one minute. Go.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: How about some privacy?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Fifty-five seconds!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES:  Do you know who I am?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN: Yes.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: Do you know who I work for?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN: Yes.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: Then you know he's put a lot of time and energy into finding you. So now I've found you. And I can tell him exactly where you are. Or I can lie, and tell him you were already dead. I'd be willing to do that, for 3.2 million dollars.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN: You've arranged this meeting so you could blackmail me?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES:  It's extortion if you want to get technical.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN: 3.2? But why not 3.3 or 3.4?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN: What makes you think I have access to that kind of money?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: Do not treat me like I'm one of them! Like I don't know who you are, or what you can do!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN: Your friend Charlotte has seen me, she knows I'm alive.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: I'll take care of Charlotte. You just worry about getting me the money. You have two days.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BEN: My present situation is a little bit restricted. Can that be amended?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: Okay. One week, in cash.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Time's up.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: Don't even think about it!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I said time's up!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: Ooh, this is hot.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: You got your meeting, now I want my answer.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: We got your name when you called the freighter. Of course we know about you and everybody else on the 815 manifest.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Then prove it.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: Your name is Katherine Anne Austen, and you're wanted for murder, fraud, arson and a whole bunch of other stuff I can't remember. You're a fugitive. You got caught in Australia and the feds were bringing you back. So  yeah, we know. If I were you, I'd stay right here on the island. Who knows, maybe you didn't survive the crash.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Come on.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Go back to your house, Kate.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: John, this has nothing to do with you—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Go back to your house, Kate!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: Hey. You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I couldn't sleep.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: Yeah. The beds take a little getting used to.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I didn't wake Aaron up, did I?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: No. Aaron was born on this island, he can sleep through anything.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CLAIRE: John. What are you doing?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: I'd like a moment alone with Kate. Would you excuse us, please, Claire?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: It's okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: John, I—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: I don't need to know why you did what you did, Kate. I just need to know what they said to each other.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Miles told Ben that he would lie to the people he worked for on the boat, tell them that Ben was dead for 3.2 million dollars.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Hmm.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Listen, John. I'm sorry. I asked you where he was—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: You're not welcome here anymore. I want you gone by morning.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: I worked it out so you two could have a few minutes of privacy.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I don't need any privacy.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: You need to talk to her, Kate. I'll be outside.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DIANE: Hello, Katherine. Was it true, what he said? Dr. Shephard. That you're a hero.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DIANE: Why won't you talk to me?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Because, mom, the last time I tried to talk to you, when you got sick? When I risked my life to see you, you screamed for help and called the police!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DIANE: Please. I don't want to fight with you, Katherine.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Why are you here?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DIANE: Because I... It all changed, when I thought you were dead.  My doctors have given me six months to live for the last four years. I don't know how long I'm going to last. So I came here to tell you that I don't want to testify against you.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Then don't.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DIANE: I want to see my grandson.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: You came here to make a deal?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DIANE: I just want to meet him.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I don't want you anywhere near him.  We're finished! We're finished!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Oh hey, Freckles. You okay? Listen, look, I'm sorry I couldn't do nothing. I wanted him to think that you'd fooled me too. No sense in him not trusting both of us.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: He wants me gone by tomorrow.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: What, he banished you? Well, I unbanish you. You can stay right here. This is my house.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Okay, me and Montezuma's house. You're gonna be alright. I'll keep you safe.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: Time. Okay, tell me. What do you remember?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DANIEL: Uh...queen of diamonds? Then uh...six! Of clubs. Sorry. And then we have the red ten of...hearts, maybe?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: It's two out of three. It's not bad. It's progress.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DANIEL: Three cards, Charlotte. Is that progress?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Hey. I've been calling your boat all day. Why isn't anyone answering?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: We're here, how should we know? If they're not answering, they're probably--
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Are you telling me there is only one line on that boat?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: There is another number that we're only supposed to use in emergencies.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JULIET: It's an emergency.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Put it on speaker.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 REGINA: Yeah?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: Regina, it's Charlotte.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 REGINA: Why are you calling me on this number?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: Minkowski wasn't answering. The people on the island want to talk to their friends, make sure they're alright.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 REGINA: What friends?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: They left last night! Frank took them up in the helicopter.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 REGINA: What do you mean they took off? I thought the helicopter was with you.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Morning.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MILES: Listen. I don't know what you think you're doing, but you're wasting your time—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Open your mouth. Open your mouth.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: Wide. Don't talk, bite down, bite down.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 LOCKE: I realize that when I tied you up in here the other day, I made the mistake of failing to introduce myself. My name is John Locke, and I'm responsible for the well-being of this island. Eventually, Miles, you're going to tell me who you are, you're going to tell me about the people on the boat, and you're going to tell me why you're so interested in Ben. In the meantime, however, you're going to keep your mouth shut. I learned something yesterday. No use in having rules if there's no punishment for breaking them. You'll be fine if you bite down on the trigger. Enjoy your breakfast.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Wait, wait, wait a minute. Just slow down.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Oh, come on! It's not like we ain't never done it before. Now, I'm cool we didn't go all the way last night. I get it. You were sad. But I mean, how can you resist after that whole "I'll keep you safe" thing?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: No, Sawyer.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: What? What, what'd I say?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Forget it.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Alright. You still think you might be pregnant.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I'm not worried. And I'm not pregnant.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Are you sure?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Yeah, I'm sure.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER:  I mean, whoo!
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Would it have been the worst thing in the world?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Yes, yes it would have been the worst thing in the world. What would we have done with a baby?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I'm going back to the beach.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Beach? What, you're leaving? Because of this? That's that? You crawl up in my bed one second, and the next you just—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Goodbye, James.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 SAWYER: Don't make this about me, Kate. You didn't want a baby any more than I did. You're just looking for some excuse to split, and now you got one. But it's alright, Freckles, I ain't gonna hold it against you. I'm just gonna sit right here in my comfy bed. Because in about a week, you'll find some reason to get pissed at Jack and bounce right back to me.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE: Ms. Dunbrook? Are the people ready to proceed?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA: May we approach the bench, your honor?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE: Oh, please.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA: Unfortunately, your honor, our chief witness, Diane Janssen, the mother of the defendant, is unable to testify because of medical reasons.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE: How long will you need?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA: I can't say right now.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JUDGE: What I'm going to do is grant a recess for lunch, but be ready to proceed with the case after we return. (to all) This court is now in recess.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 BALIFF: All rise.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA:  We have to talk.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA: My key witness spoke to her daughter yesterday, and now she's got cold feet.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: Quit posturing, and let's get to it. What are you offering?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA: Four years in.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: No jail time. Kate Austen is a worldwide hero who saved five other people's lives after a plane crash, and nearly starved to death on a deserted island. And after all that, you put this woman on trial for rescuing her mother from an abusive husband. If you think that jury is gonna give her actual time, then you must have a hell of a closing, Melissa.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA: Alright. Time served plus ten year's probation in agreement that she does not leave the state.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: What does that matter? She can go anywhere she—
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: No, I'll take it.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 DUNCAN: No, wait, Kate--
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Give me something to sign and I'll sign it. And then I walk out the back door. I just...I just want this to be over.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 MELISSA: I can do that. Ten years probation, and you stay put.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I have a child. I'm not going anywhere.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: How did you know I'd be here?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Uh, your lawyer gave me the heads up. He owed me one.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Thank you for saying what you did.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: You're welcome.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: You know, Jack, I've heard you say that story so many times, I'm starting to think you believe it.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: I just...I just wanted to tell you that what I said in there...I didn't mean it.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Do you want to follow me? Come by for a visit?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Uh, I actually have to get over to the hospital. But um...maybe you and I could grab some coffee together or something.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: I know why you don't want to see the baby, Jack. But until you do...until you want to, there's no you and me going for coffee. But um...if at anytime you change your mind, come and see us.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Yeah. Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Bye.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 JACK: Bye.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 NANNY: Kate! I'm so glad you're back. He missed you so much.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Did you keep him away from the TV?
Lost.Season04.Episode04 NANNY: Absolutely. I just put him down for a nap.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Hey buddy. Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 AARON: Hi mommy.
Lost.Season04.Episode04 KATE: Hi, Aaron.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: What's that?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: Cheat sheet Faraday drew for me.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: You don't know where your boat is?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: I know where it is.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Why are you flying directly into the thunderhead?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: Why don't you just sit back and let me do my job, huh?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Is that Penelope?   She told Charlie she didn't know about this boat, correct?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Aye.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: What do you expect to find when you get there?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Answers.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: Damn it!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: Hold on!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SERGEANT: On your sodding feet, move, move, move!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SGT: What are you waiting for, Hume?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SGT: What's the matter, Hume? Did you not hear me?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I'm sorry, sir. I was...I was having a dream, sir.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SGT: You were having a dream, were you? And what were you dreaming about, that it took you so sodding long to get to your mark?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I was in a helicopter, sir. And there was a storm, sir. And I don't remember the rest, sir.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SGT: Well, at least it was a bloody military dream. Right! All of ya! In the yard, four minutes. And you can thank Private Hume for having to do it in double time. Move!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SOLDIER 1: One, two, three!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 REST: Four!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SOLDIER 1: One, two, three!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 REST: Five!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SGT: One hundred crunches! Go, go, go, go, go!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SOLDIER 1: One, two three, four...
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SOLDIER 2:  I hope your dream was worth this, mate.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Sorry brother. It's just that, I've never had a dream so vivid. It was like I was actually there.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SGT: Have you got something to say, Hume?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SGT: I asked you a question!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: We're almost through it. I see daylight!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: What are you doing? Desmond! Are you alright?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Who are you? How do you know my name?!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JACK: Alright. They took off a day ago. Why haven't we heard from them?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: I'm going to tell you again, as I've been telling you all night, doctor. I don't know! You heard the same thing as I did when we called the boat. What makes you think I know anything?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JULIET: Because you're not worried.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JULIET: Your boat's 40 miles off the coast, it should have taken them what, 20 minutes to get there? So why aren't you worried?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: Should I wring my hands together and whisper a prayer on their behalf?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DANIEL: Hey, hey, hey, c'mon. Maybe we should just, just tell them.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JACK: Tell us what?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: Dan, let's not confuse anyone.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JULIET: Well, Daniel, maybe if you talk real slow, we'll be able to follow.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DANIEL: Your perception of how long your friends have been gone, it's not necessarily how long they've actually been gone.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JACK: What does that mean?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: This is a mistake.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DANIEL: It'll be fine, it'll be fine. As long as Frank flew on the bearings I gave him. If he stayed on it, it'll be fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JACK: And what if he didn't?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DANIEL: Then there might be side-effects.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: We're at two thousand feet, sit down!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What am I doing here?!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: What the hell's going on?!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Something's wrong with Desmond!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: How do you know my name?!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: Hold him there, Sayid!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: I'm trying!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Let go of me!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: Keep him away from the stick! We'll be there in two minutes!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: What are you doing back?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 OMAR: Who are they?!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: Survivors of 815.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: You shouldn't have brought them here, what the hell were you thinking?!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Alright, where am I?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: Alright, just take it easy.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 OMAR: Whoa.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Alright, who are you people?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 OMAR: Whoa, buddy. Calm down.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What am I doing here? who are you people?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: My friend is disoriented!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I'm not your friend! I don't know you! I don't know you!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: When did he start doing this?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: He was fine when we took off. When we hit some weather... Hey, Faraday told me as long as I stayed on the vector --
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: What's your name, my friend?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Sayid.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: Okay, Sayid. Look, we're going to take your buddy down to the sick bay, okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: I'm going with you.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: Let a doctor look at him first, then you can come down. You got my word on that, okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 OMAR: Alright.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Listen, listen. This is a mistake, alright?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 OMAR: Settle down.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I don't know these people.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 OMAR: I understand.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: No, this is wrong! I'm not supposed to be—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: —here!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SOLDIER 1: Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-three...
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SGT: Here? Here what? What the hell are you doing on your feet? Are you finished with your crunches, because you want to run?!  Right! Squad, on your feet! Right face! Ten kilometers, go, go, go, go, go!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 BILLY:  Keep moving, or so help me, I'll kill you myself!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 BILLY: What the hell's the matter with you, Des?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: If I told you, you'd think I was crazy.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 BILLY: I already know you're crazy.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: This morning, when I was in the yard doing crunches, I left.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 BILLY: What do you mean you left?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I was on a boat. And then I was back here...right where I started.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 BILLY: Des, if you're trying to get tossed out of service-
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Billy, I'm telling you the truth, man.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 BILLY: Who else was on this...boat? Anyone you recognized?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Penny. There was a photo. Penny was in the photo.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 BILLY: What? Oi, Des...where you going?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SOLDIER 3: Thanks for this morning, Hume.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Watch your step. Watch your step. Take it easy.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I'm not here. This...this isn't happening.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: You are here. And, this is happening. Look, we're going to take care of you.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Wh-wh-what am I doing here?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: It's alright, you're gonna be okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Who are you people?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: Well, my name is Keamy, and this is Omar. I'm from Vegas and he's from Florida, but as for where we are, I—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 OMAR: The last port was Fiji. So at least we know we're still in the Pacific.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: Alright, my friend. Now you just relax, okay? Now, we're gonna go get the doc, and he's gonna want to ask you some questions to help us sort all this out.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What do you mean, sort out? Wait a minute! What do you mean?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I'm not supposed to be here!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I'm not supposed to be here! Open this door! Open this door!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MAN: Hey. Hey! Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MAN: It's happening to you too, isn't it?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: What's happening to Desmond? Your friends know what's wrong with him.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: Well if they do, they're not sharing it with me.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Then perhaps you'll share how we took off at dusk and landed in the middle of the day.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: Listen. I don't know what's happening to your buddy, alright? But you gotta trust me when I tell you this. I am trying to help you.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: You want to help me? Give me your phone. Let me call my people.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: You give me that weapon and I'll give you this phone.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: Be quick. And don't go trying to call Baghdad, those phones can only call each other.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JACK: Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Jack, it's Sayid. I'm on the freighter.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JACK: Are you okay? Where the hell have you been?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Something happened during the flight, and now Desmond's in their sick bay.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JACK: Hold on, hold on, hold on. Alright, you're on speaker.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: On the helicopter, something happened to Desmond. He doesn't appear to recognize me or know where he is.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JACK:  Side-effects?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Wait, your friend, Desmond? Has he recently been exposed to high levels of radiation or electromagnetism?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Okay, look. Uh, we don't know why, but going to and coming from the Island, some people can get a little...confused.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JULIET: So, what, is this amnesia?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: No, this is not amnesia.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Hey. Hey. Hey! Can you hear me? Are you alright? Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MAN: I was just on a ferris wheel.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MAN: See, Ray? I'm not crazy. It's happening to him too, Ray. And it's going to happen to you. It's going to happen to all of us. Everyone! Once we start heading to that Island again.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY:  Would you please step aside?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MAN: No, Ray, Ray, no.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY: I need you to relax for a minute.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MAN: No! It's not going to stop it, Ray, nothing can stop it, Ray, nothing can stop it!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY:  And how are you feeling?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What the bloody hell is going on?!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY: I understand, you're disoriented.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: You're not going to stick me with that, brother!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY: I don't want to stick you with anything. It's okay, I just want to check your eyes.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Why?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY: So I can help you.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY: What's your name?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Desmond.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY: Desmond. Desmond, why don't you tell me about the last thing you remem—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Penny?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: What do you want, Desmond?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Uh, Penny, listen. I'm in trouble, and I think something's happening to me, and I'm confused, and I need to see you.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: You broke up with me and then you joined the army. And now you call with the expectation that I still care about you? Yeah, I say you are confused, Desmond.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: No, no, I'm not. It's... look, I've got two days leave starting tonight. Can I...can I come and see you?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: No. No, and don't you go showing up at the flat, either, 'cause I've moved.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Moved? Where?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: That doesn't matter. Look, Desmond, I'm going to go. Please, just don't call me again.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Look, look, now listen, Penny, Penny, I need—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: —need you.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY: Did you just experience something, Desmond?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY: What the hell, Frank? You're not supposed to be down here, and definitely not with him.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: Sorry, doc, but I've got Faraday calling from the Island, and he needs to talk to this—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY: No, Faraday's not talking to my patient, now get out of here.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: He's not your patient.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY: Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Give Desmond the phone.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Give him the phone now!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Desmond! Desmond, my name is Daniel Faraday. We met yesterday before you took off? But I'm guessing you don't remember that. Am I right?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Took off? What?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Desmond, we don't have long to talk, so I need you to tell me what year you think it is.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What do you mean, what year do I think it — it's 1996!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Alright, Desmond, Desmond look, you gotta tell me... where are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Um...um...I'm in some kind of sick bay...
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: No, no, no, no. Not right now, Desmond. Where are you supposed to be. Where are you in 1996?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Uh, Camp Millar, it's a... Royal Scots Regiment, it's just north of Glasgow.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JACK: Dan. You might wanna—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: No, no, no. I'm thinking, I'm thinking. Desmond, listen. When it happens again, Desmond, I need you to get on a train. Get on a train and go to Oxford. Oxford University. Queens College Physics Department. Alright?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What, why?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Because I need you to find me.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN:  Where is it? Where is it?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: My journal. I need my journal, I won't believe him.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JACK: Why does he think he's in 1996?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: I don't know, I don't know. It's unpredictable, it's a random effect. Sometimes it takes place for only a couple of hours, sometimes it's years.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 JACK: Wait, wait. This has happened before?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: The phone now, please. Thank you.  Desmond, you still there?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Talk to him! I can't hold them for long.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND:  Yes! What've you got?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Okay, Desmond, listen. When you find me at Queens College, I need you to tell me to set the device to 2.342.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Alright, you got it? 2.342! And it must be oscillating at 11 hertz. You got it Desmond?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: 2.342 and oscillating at eleven...
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Just remember that. 2.342 and eleven hertz, alright? And one more thing, Desmond. If the numbers don't convince me, I need you to tell me that you know about Eloise.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 OMAR: Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy...
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Desmond! Tell me that you know about Eloise!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: ...not a single piece of original thinking. You do understand the concept of original, the opposite of derivative? Now I'm the one you need to impress, Mr. Hollister, and I'm not impressed. So go. Go try again.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Um, sorry. Are you Daniel Faraday?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: And you are...?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Um...sorry, I'm Desmond Hume, and um...I was told I could find you here. I think I've ... just been to the future.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: ...the future?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Yes. Uh, I spoke to you there, you told me to come here, to Oxford, to find you. You said you'd help me.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Why didn't I just help you there, in the future?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Sorry?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Why would I put you through the headache of time travel, you know? You know what I mean, it just seems a little... unnecessary. And don't you think that my esteemed colleagues could have come up with something just a little more believable, huh? Wha—what kind of a prank is that? Huh, paradox. So uninspired.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Set your device to um... 2.342 and make sure it oscillates at 11.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Okay, now you, you're going to tell me who told you those numbers.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: You did.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: No, this is — this is ridiculous.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I know about Eloise.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What, what is all this?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: This is where I do the things Oxford frowns upon. Alright, this, this future version of me... uh, he referenced this meeting, right? Obviously, so, so I would remember you coming to Oxford, right? I would remember this, here, right now.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Actually, um, no.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Maybe you just forgot.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Yeah, right, how would that happen?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: So this, this is changing the future?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: You can't change the future.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What's that for?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Radiation.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Do I get one?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: You don't need one. For prolonged exposure, I do this 20 times a day.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: So what do you put on your head?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN:  Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: And this... this is Eloise.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What does this do?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: This, if the numbers you gave me are correct, what this will do is unstick Eloise in time. Just like you.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What happened?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Wait, shhshhshh! She's not back yet...there she is. Okay, here goes everything.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Come on, come on, that's it, come on, that's it, yes, yes, yes, haha! Yes! Oh, it worked! This is incredible.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I'm sorry, how is a rat running through a bloody maze so incredible?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: What is incredible, is I just finished the maze this morning. I'm not going to teach her to run it until an hour from now.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: S-so you, you sent her to the future!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: No, no, no. Her consciousness. Her mind.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: So, so how does that help me?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: You, what? I don't understand, am I supposed to help you? Didn't I send you back here to help me?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I don't know why you sent me here. All I know about you is, you, you end up on some bloody island.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: An island. What island, where...why would I go to an island?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: Desmond, give me the phone.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: Hey look! Hey, come on! Everybody relax, listen! Look! Daniel wanted to talk to the guy so we brought him the phone, that's all.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: You let Faraday talk to him?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 FRANK: He said he could help!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 RAY: Faraday can't even help himself!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 OMAR:  Outside now. The captain wants to talk to you.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: And I want to talk to your captain.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 KEAMY: I'll be sure to let him know. In the meantime, have a seat.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I need to get back.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Back where? The island?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: He said he could help me, said he could tell me what I needed to do.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Desmond, Desmond, can you please explain to me—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MAN: Desmond? You're Desmond?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Do I know you?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MAN: I'm George Minkowski. I'm the communications officer. Before they strapped me down here, all the calls to and from this boat came through me, in the radio room. And every so often, I'd get this flashing light on my console. An incoming call. We were under strict orders never to answer it.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: So? What's that got to do with me?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MINKOWSKI: Those calls came from your girlfriend. Penelope Widmore.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What happened?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Whoa, you're back, and you were out almost 75 minutes.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Out?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You just whoof, went catatonic right in the middle of a sentence. I had to carry you to the chair. So I take it you were, you were in the future again?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Aye.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: For how long?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I don't know...five minutes? Why does this keep happening?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: In your case, I'm guessing that progression is exponential. Each time your consciousness jumps, it gets harder and harder to jump back. I would be careful crossing the street if I were you.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: What happened to her?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: She died.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Yeah, I can see that. How?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Brain aneurysm, probably. I dunno. I'll need to do an autopsy later.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Is that going to happen to me?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: The effects seem to vary from case to case, but uh—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: If these keeps happening, am I gonna die?!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: I don't know. I think Eloise's brain short-circuited. The jumps between the present and the future...she eventually, she couldn't tell which was which — she had no anchor.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Wh...what do you mean, anchor?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Something familiar in both times. All this, see, this is all variables, it's random, it's chaotic. Every equation needs stability, something known. It's called a constant. Desmond, you have no constant. When you go to the future, nothing there is familiar. So if you want to stop this, then you need to find something there...something that you really, really care about...that also exists back here, in 1996.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: This constant — can it be a person?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Yeah, maybe. But you have to make some kind of contact. Didn't you say you were off on a boat, in the middle of nowhere?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DAN: Uh...who're you calling?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I'm calling my bloody constant.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 OPERATOR: The number you have dialed has been disconnected.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Hey, hey. You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MINKOWSKI: You look a lot older now, huh? Welcome back, Desmond.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I need to call Penny.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Calling your girlfriend is not our priority.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Listen, brother, I don't know you. But you seem to know me, so...so if you and me are friends, then I need your help. I need to call Penny, now.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MINKOWSKI: Whoa! You boys are getting way ahead of yourselfs. Two days ago, someone sabotaged all the equipment. We lost all communication with the mainland. I probably could have fixed it, but then.. .then I went nuts.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Where's the radio room?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MINKOWSKI: It's one deck up. I'll take you there. Come on.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: And how do we get out of here?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MINKOWSKI: Through the door.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MINKOWSKI: Looks like you guys have a, a friend on this boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Hey, uh...your nose, brother.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: It's clear. Let's g—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 AUCTIONEER: The Black Rock set sail from Portsmouth England on March 22, 1845 on a trading mission to the kingdom of Siam, when she was tragically lost at sea. The only known artifact of this journey is the journal of the ship's first mate, which was discovered among the artifacts of pirates on the Ile Sante-Marie off the coast of Madagascar seven years later. The contents of this journal have never been made public, or known to anyone outside the family of the seller, Tovard Hanso. We open the bidding on lot 2342 at 150,000 pounds. 150,000, sir. For 160? Do I hear one six- 160, sir. 170, sir. 180 on the phone. 200,000 pounds. 220,000 pounds, 240? 260,000 pounds, sir. 280? On the phone I have 300,000...320. 340,000 pounds. 360? 380...
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SUITED GUARD: This auction's reservation only, sir.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Listen, brother, I just need to speak to that gentleman, just for a moment, okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SUITED GUARD: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 AUCTIONEER: Sold, for 380,000 pounds to bidder 755. Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Just for a minute, alright? Mr. Widmore!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 WIDMORE: Desmond?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Can I have a word, sir?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SUITED GUARD: I'm sorry, Mr. Widmore, he—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 WIDMORE: No, no. It's fine. Walk with me.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 WIDMORE: Your word. Let's have it.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I need to get in touch with Penny. I don't know how to reach her, and her number's been disconnected.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 WIDMORE: There was a time when if you'd have asked her to marry you, I'm certain she would've said yes. Unfortunately, your cowardice won out instead. I take it you've had second thoughts, and you'd like her to give you another chance.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Why do you hate me so much?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 WIDMORE: It's not me who hates you. Here's her address... I'll let her tell you herself.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MINKOWSKI: Desmond. I know... it's getting harder. It starts happening faster too.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Come on, let's move.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Hey, how did this happen to you?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MINKOWSKI: We were anchored here. Waiting for our orders. Bored out of our minds. Me and Brandon — he's one of the crew members  we took off the ship's tender. We just wanted to see the island. But Brandon started acting crazy...so we had to turn around.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Where is he?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MINKOWSKI: In a body bag.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MINKOWSKI: There.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Who did this?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MINKOWSKI: You got me. But when the captain finds out, I feel sorr—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: After your call, someone has to tell me precisely what is going on.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Can you fix it, brother?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: I need a minute. Do you have the number to make the call?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Wake up, wake up, you've got to come back! You've got to come back—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Desmond! Do you know the number?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Well, you better remember it.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: It's 2004...
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: I didn't realize it was almost Christmas. It's been...
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: ...Desmond.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 MINKOWSKI: I...can't....get....back!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: What happened to him?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: The same thing that's gonna happen to me.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Desmond? What are you doing here?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I had to... I mean, I tried to call you, but you disconnected your phone.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Yeah, because I moved. Look, I don't know if you're getting the signals, Desmond, but I'm trying to make a clean break from you, so if you don't mind, I'm gonna—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Wait a minute, Pen, please wait. I just need to get your new phone number, okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Why would I give you that?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Because I made a huge mistake, I never should have broken up with you, and, and and... and I know that now,  and I'm sorry, and—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Don't, just don't dare—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: —and I understand. And I know it's... it's too late to change things, but I need to tell you something and, and I need you to listen to me, and I know it's going to sound ridiculous, but... please, Pen. I need you to listen to me.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Just, say what you need to say and then go.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I know this doesn't make any sense, because it doesn't make any sense to me. But... eight years from now... I, I need to call you, and I, I can't call you if I don't have your number.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Look, Penny, just, just give me your number, and, and I, I know I've ruined things, and I know you think things are over between us, but they're not. If there's any part of you that still believes in us, just give me your number.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: And what's to say you won't call me tonight, or tomorrow.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I won't call for eight years. December 24, 2004. Christmas Eve. I promise. Please, Pen.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: If I give you the number, will you leave?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Aye.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: 7946-0893.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: All that, and you're not going to write it down?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND:  It wouldn't do any good. You have to keep that number. You can't change the—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Just get out, get out!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: —just, just remember, December the 24th, 2004. If you still care about me you'll have to—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I'm not crazy, Penny! You have to believe me! You have to—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: —trust me.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: I do trust you. But you still have to remember that number.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: 7946-0893.  It's a London number.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Excellent timing...the patch is done, but I don't know how long the battery will last. I hope she's there.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I hope so too.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Penny?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Desmond?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Penny...Penny, you answered. You answered, Penny.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Des, where are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I'm... I'm, I'm on a boat. Um... I've been on an island, and— Oh my god, Penny. Is that really you?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Yeah! Yes, it's me!
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: You believe me? You still care about me?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Des, I've been looking for you for the past three years. I know about the island. I've been researching------and then when I spoke to your friend Charlie, that's when I knew you were still alive. That's when I knew I wasn't crazy. Des, are you still there!?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Yes, yes, I'm here! I'm still here, can you hear me?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: Yeah, yeah, that's better.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I love you, Penny. I've always loved you. I'm so sorry. I love you.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: I love you too.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: I don't know where I am, but—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: I'll find you, Des—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: —I promise—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: —no matter what—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: —I'll come back to you—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 PENNY: —I won't give up—
Lost.Season04.Episode05 BOTH: I promise. I love you.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: I'm sorry. The power source went dead, it's all we have.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Thank you, Sayid.  It was enough.
Lost.Season04.Episode05 SAYID: Are you alright now?
Lost.Season04.Episode05 DESMOND: Aye. I'm perfect.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Hello. I'm sorry I'm late. You must be Dr. Burke.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Juliet.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Juliet. I'm Harper Stanhope. Please sit. Today is just a meet and greet so that we can get to know each other.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Please don't take this the wrong way, but I-I really don't think I need therapy.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: How about we call it "talking" instead of therapy?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Good.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Let's talk. So you've been here a week. And what's your least favorite part so far?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: I don't like being treated like a celebrity.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: And is that surprising? You're big news right now.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Yes, I know. I guess I don't like being the center of attention. It makes me feel isolated ... alone. (Chuckles nervously)
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Well, maybe you feel that all eyes are on you, but you're not a celebrity, and soon enough, you'll realize that you're no different than anyone here.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Oh, I-I know. I-I never meant that I—
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Yes?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 TOM: Harper, I'm sorry for the interruption. I know you don't like me busting in, but Ben would like to see the doc.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Uh... She's all yours, Tom. It was nice talking to you, Juliet. Welcome to the Island.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 TOM: That Harper's a piece of work.  But you give her a week, she'll have you cryin' about your daddy. I'm speaking from personal experience here. 
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Welcome to your humble abode.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: This is for me? The whole house?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: You're here to help us with some very important research, Juliet. We pulled out all the stops. Two bedrooms, two baths. Washer, dryer. Fresh linens, a well-stocked fridge.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Oh, and I know you love the opera. You have all the classics on CD.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Ben, this is amazing. Seriously, you shouldn't have gone to all the trouble. I'm only gonna be here for six months.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Right, of course. But... we want you to feel at home.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 SUN: Need some help?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: I'm fine. I just can't seem to get it steady.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 SUN: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Nice. Thanks.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 SUN: Why are you going to all this trouble when we're about to leave this island?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Well, I still need somewhere to sleep tonight, right?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Juliet.  Have you seen Charlotte and Faraday? All their stuff's gone.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: No, I haven't seen them. You still have the sat phone, right?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JIN: 샬롯하고 패러데이는 정글로 들어가는 걸 봤는데.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 SUN: He saw them going into the jungle.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Why didn't he say anything?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 SUN: 왜 아무한테도 얘기 안 했어요?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JIN: You said... they are friends.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 SUN: Aren't they?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: All right, we've got a lot of ground to cover, so let's fan out. If you cut their trail, call out to me. I'll come to you.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Hello, Juliet. Long time no see.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: I came to deliver a message... from Ben. The two people you're looking for — Faraday and Lewis — they're headed to the Tempest. And if they figure out how to deploy that gas... then everyone on this island is going to die.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Why don't you stop them?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Because Ben wants you to go.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: How can Ben possibly know where they are when he's a prisoner?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Ben is exactly where he wants to be.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: How am I supposed to stop them?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: By pointing the gun and pulling the trigger.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Who are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: I'm an old friend of Juliet's. I just told her where the people you're looking for are headed. Maybe you and your gun can go too.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: Uh, I was just looking for some gauze. I-I didn't know anyone was here.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: How'd you manage that?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: I, um... I-I work over at the power station. I was pressed up against the transformer.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Take a seat. Let me take a look at it.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: You're Burke, right? The baby doctor.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: What gave me away?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: I heard we lost Henrietta this morning. It's okay. It's not your fault.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Pregnant women are dying on this island. I was brought here to help fix that. So whose fault is it?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: Believe me, nobody expects you to fix it overnight.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: You have anyone to talk to? Any friends here? Maybe Harper.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Harper hates me.  We only talk because we have to. I get the feeling that she is a mean... and spiteful person.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: She's my wife.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: She's your wife? I'm sorry. I didn't—
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: No, don't worry about it. Really, it's okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Okay, you're, uh, you're set.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: Much obliged, ma'am.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: Hey. I know this place can wear on you, but if you need to talk... I'm around.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Good to know. Oh, um... if you promise not to tell your wife what I said about her, I won't tell anyone that you lied about how you hurt your arm. I know a chemical burn when I see one.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: You got a deal. Uh, by the way... I'm Goodwin.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Juliet.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Faraday and Charlotte are heading for the Tempest.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: The Tempest?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: It's safer for you if I don't talk about it.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: No. Talk about it, please.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: It's an electrical station that powers the Island.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Why would they go there?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Hey. If there's something you need to tell me, now's the time to do it.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: What I need is for you to help me. Will you help me?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: If we move all night, maybe we can still catch them. Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 DAN: I think it's that way. But what happens if I... what if I can't do it?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CHARLOTTE: Dan. Look at me. I know you can do this. Should we get going?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 DAN: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CHARLOTTE: Come on.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 DAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's—it's okay. It's okay. It's Kate.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 DAN: So they have Miles?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: Yeah, but he's fine. They're treating him fine. I thought you two were with Jack at the beach. What are you guys doing out here?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CHARLOTTE: Jack was trying to communicate with Sayid and Desmond on the freighter, but their sat phone ran out of juice. It's totally dead. There's no way we can call the boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CHARLOTTE: So we volunteered to get the spare batteries out of the packs that we threw out of the chopper.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: So... if you threw your pack from the chopper, what's that?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 DAN: This? Uh... it's... just borrowed this.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: Mind if I take a look?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CHARLOTTE: Go ahead, Dan. Show her.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: Batteries, huh? What's this for—
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: —uhh!
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CHARLOTTE: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: That woman--what was her name?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Harper.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: The two of you friends?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Not exactly. She was my therapist.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: You people had therapists?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: It's very stressful being an Other, Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Seemed kinda hostile, even for a therapist.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: I'm sure there are things from your past that you'd rather not talk about.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Yeah. You read them all in my file.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Trust me, Jack. You don't want to see my file.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: The problem occurs somewhere during the second trimester, when the mother's immune system is triggered. The white blood cell count plummets. It's like the... immune system turns on the fetus.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: May I?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Sure.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Any thought yet on a cause?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Mm, it's really too early to tell, but only women who've conceived on the Island does it happen to—
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: —which makes me wonder—
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: Hey Juliet. Oh, Ben, I didn't know you were here. Ethan's out sick.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: I have an extra egg salad on rye. I was just checking to see if Juliet wants it.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Thanks. No, I already ate. Oh, besides, I have an appointment with your wife in 10 minutes.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: Great. Tell her I said hi.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Oh, will do.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: Ben?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: No, I'm fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: So, Juliet, what do you think of Ben?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: He's great. Uh, very smart... and intense. Challenging. He's been really good to me.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Of course he has. You look just like her.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: And I see you and my husband have become friendly.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Yeah. He's great. He's been really helpful.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: When did you start sleeping with him?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Look, Juliet, I'm not an idiot. So just tell me. When did it start?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Okay.  I'm not doing this. We're done.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: No. Please respect me enough to spare me the pretense that you are actually offended. I know. I followed you. Watched you.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET:  I'm sorry.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: It doesn't matter anymore. But what does matter is that you listen to me and that you believe me. And if you continue to have a relationship with Goodwin, there will be consequences. I don't want him to get hurt.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: I would never hurt him.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HARPER: Look it, I am not talking about you. I am talking about Ben.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CLAIRE: Hi John.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: Hey Claire. Is there something I can do for you?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CLAIRE: I want to know what's going on with Miles.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: Right now, not a whole lot. I'm... bringing him food and water until he decides to talk.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CLAIRE: I'd like to talk to him myself.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE:  And why would you want to do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CLAIRE: John, we have to find out who these people are and where they came from. And why they're not interested in rescuing us.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: And you don't think I'm gonna get that out of him?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CLAIRE: No, I... I just think we might be taking the wrong approach. I mean, you killed one, Ben shot one, and now we're holding one prisoner. You know, it's not hard to understand why they might think we're hostile. I might be just a little less intimidating.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: It's not gonna happen, Claire.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CLAIRE: John, I don't—
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: You do remember what Charlie said about these people.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CLAIRE: All Charlie said was whose boat it isn't. Don't you wanna know whose boat it is?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Rabbit today?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: We're running out of chickens.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: This didn't have a number on it, did it?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: Eat, change, put your laundry and dishes by the door. I'll be back to collect them in 15 minutes.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: So has the revolution begun yet? Or...
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Well, you're the leader now. I know it's a tough position. You have to deal with all those people constantly second-guessing your decisions, and it always starts out so innocently, doesn't it? A question here, a comment there, and then if you're not careful, you find you have a full-blown insurrection on your hands. Believe me, your people are gonna be so angry when they realize you still don't have a plan.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: And I assume you have a plan.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: I always have a plan.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: Does it involve you raising $3.2 million? Phew. That's a lot of money. Wait.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: Maybe this'll get you started. Put your laundry and dishes by the door.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: I can help you, John. We have shared interests... or at least a common enemy.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: And that would be our friends on the freighter.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Not them. The one they work for. Let me out of here. Give me some semblance of freedom, let me sleep in a bed and eat with utensils, and I give you my word I'll tell you everything you want to know about the person who sent the freighter.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: Yeah, but see, there's the problem. I don't trust your word.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: All right, then. I guess I'll have to show you.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: I hope this is good.  I don't know much about wine. I swiped this off the sub.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: There.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Thanks.  Mmm.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: I wish we could do this all the time. I hate that we have to be so... private.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: What's the matter with being private?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN:  It's ridiculous. I've been sleeping on the couch for a year. Why am I not just telling her?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: I don't think it's a good idea.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: Why not?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Ben wouldn't like it.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: That's what this is about? You're worried about Ben? Why? Because he has a crush on you?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: You know?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: Come on. Everyone knows. He follows you around like a puppy.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: And you don't think that's a problem?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN:  Now, a little less than a kilometer from here, he has me working with chemicals, that could kill every man, woman and child on this island if I flip the wrong switch. Trust me, Ben has enough on his plate. The last thing he cares about is you and me.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: I just... get the feeling that he would be upset.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: What's Ben gonna do?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Goodwin! You see where the tail landed?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 GOODWIN: Yeah, probably in the water.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: You run, you can make that shore in an hour.  Ethan, get up there to that fuselage. There may actually be survivors, and you're one of 'em — a passenger. You're in shock. Come up with an adequate story if they ask.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Stay quiet if they don't. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in three days. Go.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Something's wrong. We should've... we should've caught up with 'em by now.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: These people base jumped out of a helicopter, Jack. Let's give 'em the benefit of the doubt.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Hey. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Hey.  It's all right. It's okay. Hey. It's okay. It's all right. Come on. Take it easy.  Take it easy.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: I'll go get her some water.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Yeah. Thanks.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: What happened?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE:  I was going back to the beach, and... I ran into Faraday and that woman... um... Charlotte. I think she hit me.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: They disappeared out of camp last night. We've been trying to catch up with them.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: Do you know where they were headed?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Some sort of... power station.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: Jack. They had gas masks.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Juliet? Juliet?! Juliet! Juliet!
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: All right, no tricks. You're not leading me out into the jungle so you can disappear or shoot me in the back.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: No tricks, John. We don't even have to leave the living room.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: So let's have it.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: We have a deal, right?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: How do I know you're not gonna run off and meet your people first chance you get?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN:  If my people still wanted me, John, they would've stormed this camp long ago. It's behind that picture.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: 36-15-28.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: "Red Sox"?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: I taped over the game.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: This is Charles Widmore. This is the man whose boat is parked offshore. This is the man that's been trying to find the Island.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: Who's the man in the blindfold?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: One of my people that had the misfortune to get caught.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: How does Widmore know about the Island?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: I don't know, but he does.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: What does he want?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: John, three months ago in Gainesville, Florida, the Virgin Mary seemed to appear in a patch of mold on the side of an old housing complex. When the word got out, over 5,000 people came to see her face for themselves. You've survived an airline crash on this island. One minute, you're in a wheelchair. The next minute, you're doing jumping jacks. If 5,000 people came out to see a piece of mold, how many people do you think would come here to see you? Charles Widmore wants to exploit this island, and he'll do everything in his power to possess it.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Everything I know about Charles Widmore is in this file. Some of it's vague, some of it's guesswork, some of it's concrete. But this is everything, and now it's all yours.  I'm sorry I didn't tell you all this sooner. But it was the only bargaining chip I had left.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 LOCKE: There's one more thing I need to know. Your man on the boat...I want you to tell me who it is.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Alright. But you might want to sit down.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: She came through here. So did they, about half an hour ahead of her.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: What happened?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: Sorry?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: At Locke's — why did you stay?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: I stayed because I had to find something out.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Are you gonna tell me, or are we gonna keep walking through the jungle like it doesn't matter?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: I stayed to find out if the people on the freighter know who I am... if they knew that I'm a fugitive... that I'm wanted for murder.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Do they?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: Yeah, they know... we should keep moving. God knows where Juliet is.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Hi. Come on in. Sorry. I have to get this ham out of the oven, or it'll dry out.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Please. Don't mind me. How are you feeling, by the way?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Never better.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: It smells delicious.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Ben, I thought this was a dinner party.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Just you and me. Oh, I guess I should've made that clearer.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: ... No. It's fine. I—I hope you like dinner rolls.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: I do indeed.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: I want to thank you for how wonderful you've been with Zack and Emma.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: They're really sweet kids.  Ben, they've been asking me about their mother in Los Angeles. I'm not really sure what to say.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: They'll stop asking in time.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: They're children. Do they really belong here?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: They're on the list, Juliet.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Who are we to question who's on the list and who's not?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Now that we have everyone on the list from the tail section, what about Goodwin?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: He's been undercover for three weeks.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: ... He's making a case for this woman, Ana Lucia.  He thinks she'd be a valuable member of our society. But between you and me, I don't see it. He feels very passionately about her, almost inappropriately so.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: After losing Ethan, it's a risk.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Goodwin stays where he's at right now, Juliet. There's no reason for him to hurry back, right? But his assignment will be over soon. I promise you.

Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: You want to release the gas? You'll die with the rest of us.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 DAN: No, no. I—I'm not trying to release it. I'm trying to — I'm trying to render it inert. Juliet, I just want to make it safe.

Lost.Season04.Episode06 CHARLOTTE: We're trying to disable it before he can use it against us!
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CHARLOTTE: Juliet... look me in the eye and tell me you are certain that Benjamin Linus wouldn't use this gas to kill everyone on this island! We know he's used it before. If you want to stop us, you're going to have to shoot us both.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE: 10 seconds to contamination.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CHARLOTTE: Daniel!
Lost.Season04.Episode06 DAN: Yeah, yeah! I'm trying!
Lost.Season04.Episode06 DAN: Come on.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 WOMAN'S AUTOMATED VOICE: Contamination in 5... 4... 3... 2...
Lost.Season04.Episode06 DAN: That... that was a close one.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: What are you reading?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Shephard's file. Mikhail dropped it off. He's a spinal surgeon, Ben. He has extensive experience in tumor removal.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Hmm. How about that?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: He can help you. I thought you'd be more excited. What's wrong?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: I need you to come with me.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: After our last raid on the tail-section survivors, they ran off, left the beach. I sent Pickett and Tom to track their location, and they came across this. I'm sorry, Juliet.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Sorry about what?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Oh my god, oh my god!
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Oh my god. Oh my god.  Goodwin.  What happened?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: We don't know; there weren't any witnesses. I can only assume they found out he wasn't one of them. Guess I should've listened to you.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Why are you showing me this? Why did you bring me out here?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: What, you mean instead of his wife?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: You knew this would happen. You sent him out here because you knew this would happen. (Cries) You wanted this! You wanted him to die! Why?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: "Why"? You're asking me "why"? After everything I did to get you here, after everything I've done to keep you here, how can you possibly not understand... that you're mine!
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN: Take as much time as you need.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Whoa, Kate, it's all right. They're on our side.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: Our side, Juliet? She just knocked me unconscious.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 CHARLOTTE: Yeah. I'm very sorry about that, but I had no choice. Look, Daniel's inside securing the facility. If you come with me, I will be more than happy to explain exactly how we just saved your life.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 KATE: All right. Let's go.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: I'll take their word for it.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: He wanted me to kill them. Ben. He told me to kill both of them.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: How can he tell you anything?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: I don't know, but he knew how to get to me, and he knew where they were going and what they were doing. Don't you understand? These people came here to wage war against Ben, and Ben's going to win, Jack. And when he does, you don't want to be anywhere near me.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: Why not?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JULIET: Because he thinks that I'm his.  And he knows how I feel about you.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 JACK: He knows where to find me.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 SAWYER: Oh! Beat that. 
Lost.Season04.Episode06 SAWYER: Son of a bitch! How'd you get so damn good at horseshoes?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 HURLEY: I don't know. Guess I'm just ... lucky.
Lost.Season04.Episode06 SAWYER: What the hell are you doing out?
Lost.Season04.Episode06 BEN:  See you guys at dinner.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 KEAMY: Lapidus! You ready?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 LAPIDUS: I'll be up.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 KEAMY: Don't be late, Frank.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 LAPIDUS: Regina?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 REGINA:  Frank!  I didn't hear you.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 LAPIDUS: Sorry, I didn't mean to spook you. Captain wanted me to bring these guys some grub... you know your book's upside down.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 LAPIDUS: Just trying to help...
Lost.Season04.Episode07 LAPIDUS: Thought I'd check in on you guys and bring you some food.  How are you feeling, by the way?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: Yeah, much better, thanks.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: Why are we being held captive? We had nothing to do with Minkowski's death.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 LAPIDUS: This has nothing to do with Minkowski. The captain wasn't very happy that you two decided to bust out of sick bay and into our radio room.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: We didn't bust out. The door was left open! We assumed that was you.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 LAPIDUS: Why the hell would I do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: Did you have any contact with our people on the beach?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 LAPIDUS: No luck. Something must have happened to the phone.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: Lima beans?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 LAPIDUS: Sorry, we had a little problem in the kitchen. Just stay put, alright?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: I still want to talk to the captain.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 LAPIDUS: No, you don't.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 LAPIDUS: Regina?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 왜 그래? 괜찮아? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 사이드하고 데스몬드가 떠난지 3일이나 지났는데 왜 아직 돌아오지 않는 걸까요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 아마 배를 타고 오느라 시간이 좀 걸리나봐. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 자, 그 얘기 그만하고 더 중요한 게 하나 있어. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 뭔데? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: Let's talk about baby names.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Good. You're getting better... But no, Jin.  지금부터 아기 이름을 지으면 못 나가요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 웬 미신? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 이 녀석한테 나쁜 일이 생기면 안 되지. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 당신 말뜻은 우리 공주님. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 어, 그러니까 당신은 딸일 것이다? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 지연. 지연이라고 지을래. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 아기 이름은 그만 얘기해요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 왜 지연이 마음에 안 들어? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 아니, 이름은 예뻐요. 우리 이렇게 해요. 우선 이 섬에서 벗어난 다음에 그때 가서 아기 이름을 지어요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: Deal!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 WOMAN ON THE PHONE: 긴급 상황 서비스입니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 네, 저 응급차 좀 불러주세요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 WOMAN ON THE PHONE: 어떻게 도와드릴까요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 저 임신부인데요. 뭐가 잘못된 것 같아요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 STORE OWNER: 어서 오세요! 뭐 찾으시는 거 있으세요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 예, 팬더 하나요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 STORE OWNER: 자, 이쪽으로요. 예. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 네, 좋아요. 저걸로 주세요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 STORE OWNER: 마음에 드신다니 다행이네요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 아니요, 시간이 없어요. 병원에 가는 길이예요. 얼만데요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 STORE OWNER: 5만원입니다. 분만실? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 예. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 STORE OWNER: 아이, 진작 말씀해 주시지! 참 기쁘시겠네요. 혹시 아드님인지 따님인지 아시나요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 아, 그건 아직 몰라요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 STORE OWNER: 팬더는 누구든 다 좋아하니까 걱정 마세요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 네, 네... 지금 가는 길입니다. 예, 알겠습니다. 네, 간다니까요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 STORE OWNER: 어서 가세요! 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 진수 씨! 진수 씨! 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 진수 씨, 케이트하고 잭이 돌아왔어요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: What happened?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 KATE: You mean before or after the redhead knocked me out?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: She hit you?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 KATE: When I ran into them on my way back from Locke's camp.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Why would she do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 KATE: I guess she didn't wanna have to explain why she was on her way to a poison gas factory. Juliet told Jack that it was a power station.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Why would Juliet lie about that?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 KATE: Force of habit?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Why were they going there?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 KATE: To turn it off, to deactivate the gas. I guess they wanted to earn some brownie points.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Do you think they're really going to rescue us?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 KATE: In all the time they've been here they've talked about a lot of things, and none involved rescuing us.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: Good morning.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: Good morning.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID:  I hope they resolve their kitchen issues.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: Sayid! What's that?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: It's a note. Three days ago, when I was in Locke's camp, Ben claimed he had a spy on this boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Hello. My name is Sun.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DANIEL: Hi, Sun, hi... I'm Daniel.  Something I can help you with?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: I'm two months pregnant.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DANIEL: Oh, you're... Wow, that's... Congratulations!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: So are you here to rescue us?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: It's a simple question. Are you or are you not going to rescue us?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DANIEL: The thing is... um, it's not really my call, Sun.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: And whose call is it?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: Uh, can you pass, uh, the cereal?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JACK: Pretty good English, Jin.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: Thank you. I... understand better than I, uh, speak.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JACK: Has Sun been teaching you, or are you just picking it up?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: Uh, Sun teach me... Uh, Sawyer, too. Sun, is... better.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JACK: I bet.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JACK: Hey Sun. How are you feeling?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: I'm good, thank you... The morning sickness has stopped, which has been nice.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JACK: That's good... Well, if you need anything, just let me know, okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: Would you like some breakfast?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 진수 씨, 지금부터 이유는 묻지 말고 내가 시키는 대로만 해야 해요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 왜, 뭔데? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 이틀 동안 우리 먹을 식량을 챙겨서 20분 후에 우리 텐트에서 봐요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 뭐 때문에 그러는데? 무슨 일이 생겼어? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 로크한테 가봐야겠어요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: What are you doing?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: I needed another bottle of those vitamins you gave me, the... the pre-natals?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: You could've just asked.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: You're right. I should have.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: What happened to the last ones I gave you?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Sorry?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: The last bottle I gave you. There should be 20 left... are you planning a trip?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Please, just give me the vitamins.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: Where are you going, Sun?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: We're going to Locke's camp.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: What? Why?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Because I don't trust these people.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: Whether you trust them or not, you can't go there. Locke doesn't want to leave the island, and I've told you... Sun, pregnant women... they don't survive here.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Yes, you did tell me that.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: You don't believe me... Look, I know that I have been less than truthful about certain things since coming here, but I promise you, Sun... I promise you, I'm not lying about this. After everything you've confided in me, I should at least have your trust.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Claire's baby is fine. I feel fine. All I have are your stories that I'm going to get sick. I'm going to do what's best for me and for my baby, because, no... I don't trust you.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 NURSE 1: 곧 괜찮으실 겁니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 NURSE 2: 맞지? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 NURSE 1: 맞아, 오세아닉 6. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 잠깐만요, 지금 뭐하시는 거예요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 NURSE 1: 귀금속 빼셔야 합니다. 혈압이 높아서 몸이 많이 부었어요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 안돼요, 내 반지는 안돼요! 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 NURSE 1: 별일 없으니 안심하세요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 아냐아냐, 그냥 둬. 백선화 씨, 전 닥터 박 대신 담당을 맡은 닥터 배입니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 박 선생님은요? 저 왜 이러는 거예요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 박 선생님은 지금 출장 중입니다.   제가 우선 진통제를 놔드리겠습니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 자, 봅시다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 제 애기한테 무슨 이상이 있는 건가요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 태아가 스트레스가 있군. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 뭐가 잘못됐나요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 아직은 잘 모르겠지만 알아보겠습니다. 연락드릴 가족분 계십니까? 남편분이나 부모님? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 제 남편한테 연락을... 제 남편 좀 불러주세요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 진수 씨? 진수 씨 좀 불러주세요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 제가 바로 남편분에게 연락 드릴테니... 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 제 남편 좀 불러주세요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 남편 꼭 오실겁니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 진수 씨... 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 어, 택시! 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 아우, 간다니까요... 여보세요? 여보세요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 야, 뭐야? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 이놈의 새끼, 너! 너 이 새끼야! 너 오늘 죽었어, 너 나한테 잡히기만 해봐! 나한테 보이기만 해봐! 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 팬더 하나만 더 주세요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 STORE OWNER: 어떡하죠, 손님. 그 인형이 마지막 거였는데요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 저거는요? 바로 뒤에 있잖아요! 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 STORE OWNER: 저거는 벌써 팔린 거예요. 사신 게 워낙 잘 팔리는 물건이 돼서요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 얼마면 돼요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 STORE OWNER: 저거 팔렸대니까요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 STORE OWNER: 손님, 이거는 어때요? 올해가 용띠 아니예요? 행운을 갖고 올 거 같은데. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 그냥 그 팬더 이리 갖고 와요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 STORE OWNER: 이거 마지막 거니까 잃지 마세요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 KATE: Once you hit the stream, you want to head northwest, pretty much in a straight line for about a day and a half.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 KATE: I'm gonna have to tell Jack. But I'll give you guys a nice, long headstart.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: I'd tell him myself, but he wouldn't understand.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 KATE: No, he wouldn't.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 KATE: You'd better get going. Be safe okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: She's not going anywhere. Sun, this is a bad idea.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: What concern is it of yours?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET:  Do you understand your wife's medical condition right now?  Translate for me.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET:  Your wife is very sick. If she doesn't get off this island in three weeks, she will die.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 신경쓰지 말아요, 어서 가요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: If you let her go, your wife is in danger. Jin... Danger.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: Wherever Sun go, I go.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: Sun! Please.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: Jin. Your wife had an affair.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: Sun was with another man. She thought the baby was his.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 진수 씨... 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 진수씨, 진수씨... 나랑 얘기 좀 해요. 내가 다 설명할게. 그건 오래 전 일이었어요. 나 좀 봐봐. 나 좀 봐봐. 나 다신 이러는 거 이해해. 입이 열 개라도 나 할말이 없어. 그래도 나한테 설명할 기회를 좀 줘요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 나한테 설명할 기회를 좀 줘요.   진수 씨... 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 BERNARD: Hey! You going fishing?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 BERNARD: Uh, you mind if I... tag along?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 BERNARD: Oh... Oh, I am sorry. I—I didn't mean to interrupt.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: No. Come.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 BERNARD: You're sure?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: Yes... come.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 BERNARD: You realize we're the only two married guys on the island?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 BERNARD: Married?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: Married.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 BERNARD: Yeah, well, no, not to each other. No.  You got it. It's not easy, is it? Oh, I mean, it's—it's wonderful, but... let's face it, every decision that you make takes twice as long. 'Cause you always gotta talk them into it.  Rose... has cancer. She's sick. Dying. Well, at least, she 'was' dying. She says she's better now. She says it's this place... the island. But when the camp split up, I was sure that she'd want to go with Locke. Why would she want to leave the island, and risk getting sick again?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: Then why do you stay with Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 BERNARD: Because it was the right thing to do. Locke... he's a murderer. See, it's all about karma, Jin. Do you know karma?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 BERNARD: You make bad choices, bad things happen to you. But you make good choices, and then good—
Lost.Season04.Episode07 BERNARD: Hey! Hey, hey, hey! You got one! Yeah. Here, pull it in.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 BERNARD: Wow, look at that! You see? Now, that's karma. We must be the good guys, huh?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: How long's that gonna go on for, eh? Can't they just fix whatever the bloody hell's causing that?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: That sound is not mechanical.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: What, you think somebody's doing that? Somebody's just banging those pipes again and again?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: That's exactly what I think.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: Gentlemen, thanks for your patience. The captain would like to see you now.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: Where's the helicopter?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: Lapidus is running an errand.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: What kind of errand?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: I'm a doctor. I don't know where he's going.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: Did he go to the island?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: You know anywhere else he could land?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: What's he going to do there?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: I said I'm just a doctor.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: What did Lapidus say?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: He didn't say anything to me.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID:  What is he doing there?!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: Hey! Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: That woman just jumped over the side of the ship!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: Don't just stand there! What's the matter with you people?!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: What's wrong with you? Get the rope!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: Why aren't you doing anything?!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: Bring a rope!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: Get a rope!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND and SAYID: Get a rope!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: Stop!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: She just jumped!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: It's over! She's gone! Everybody get back to your posts. That was an order.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: I'm Captain Gault. I suppose you two have a few questions.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: So what can I do for you?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: You boys said you wanted to speak with me.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: Let's just start with why a woman jumped over the side of your ship, and you did nothing to stop it.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: I didn't jump in, or order my crew to jump in, because I didn't want to lose any more people.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: What exactly is going on here?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: Some of my crew has been dealing with... what might best be described as a heightened case of cabin fever. I think it's got something to do with the close proximity of the island.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: Why don't you turn around, then?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: I've tried, but we have a saboteur on board, and he's done one hell of a job on my engines. I've got my crew working around the clock to repair them.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: And then you'll take our people home?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: Then we move to safer waters... those are my orders.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: And I don't suppose you'll tell us who gave you those orders?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: Sure, I will. Charles Widmore.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: This is Charles Widmore's boat?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: That's right. You know him.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: Do either of you know what this is?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: It's a flight data recorder, otherwise known as a black box.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 GAULT: That's exactly what it is. Now here's the funny thing. This black box comes from Oceanic Flight 815. A salvage vessel recovered it from the bottom of the ocean. It took a considerable amount of Mr. Widmore's resources to procure it. It was found with the wreckage of the plane, along with all 324 dead passengers.  That's not the complete story, as you are well aware, Mr. Jarrah, given the fact that you're standing here, breathing... the wreckage was obviously staged. Now, can you imagine what kind of resources and manpower go into pulling off a feat of that magnitude? Faking the recovery of a plane crash? Putting 324 families through a grieving process based on a lie? But what's even more disturbing... where exactly does one come across 324 dead bodies? And that, Mr. Jarrah, Mr. Hume, is just one of the many reasons we want Benjamin Linus.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: I'm sorry. I had to stop you any way I could.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: It wasn't your place to stop us.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: I know you don't trust me, but you need to get off this island. We all do.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: You want to leave?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JULIET: More than anything. I don't know if that boat out there is the answer or not, but it's something. I need to go home. So do you. Sun... in about three weeks, you'll be in an almost constant state of nausea. A week after that, you will experience shortness of breath that won't go away. A week after that, you will lose consciousness and slip into a coma. And then, Sun, you will die. And when your heart stops beating... so will the baby's. And that, Sun, is why it is my business, because you are my patient. If you go... you will die. And your baby will never be born.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 선화 씨! 제왕절개를 해야할 것 같습니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 안돼요, 그건 안돼요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 잘 모르는 것 같으신데, 저희가 놓아드린 진통제 때문에 자연분만은 아주 힘들 거 같습니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 안돼요, 남편이, 내 남편이 올 때까지 안돼... 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 바로 수술하셔야 합니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 내 남편 어디 있어요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 아직 안 오셨습니다. 더 이상 기다릴 수가 없어요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 진수 씨! 진수 씨! 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 NURSE 1: 선생님, 아이가 보이기 시작했어요! 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 자, 선화 씨. 이제부터 힘을 주셔야 합니다. 거의 다 왔습니다. 조금만 더 미세요! 미세요! 할 수 있습니다! 네, 조금만 더 미세요! 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 잘 하셨습니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DR. BAE: 축하드립니다. 따님을 출산하셨습니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: So what do you think of the captain?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: He was surprisingly forthcoming.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: Yeah, he tells it like it is. Just don't piss him off. You know what I mean? I think you'll like your room. It's on a quiet part of the ship.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: This... ship isn't moving.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: Well, if you say so.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: That shouldn't still be there... Damn it!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: Hey, Johnson. Is that you? Johnson!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JOHNSON: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: Mop this up.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JOHNSON: Sorry, I gotta go up on deck.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY: No, you're gonna mop this up!
Lost.Season04.Episode07 RAY:  Kevin, this is, uh...
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: Sayid.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 DESMOND: Desmond.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JOHNSON: Kevin Johnson.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SAYID: Nice to meet you Kevin.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: I made... dinner.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 난 당신이 날 떠난 줄 알았어요. 나한테 설명할 기회를 좀 줘요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 상관 없어. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 당신도 내 말을... 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 당신이 왜 그랬는지 난 알고 있어. 그리고 내가 어떤 남자였는지도... 잘 알아. 이 섬에 오기 전에... 내가 당신에게 냉정하게 대하고 당신보다는 일을 선택한 나였어. 하여튼... 이 모든 것들이 다 나 때문이야. 그거 잘 알아. 그래서... 내가 당신을... 용서해. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 자, 로크한테 당신하고 같이 갈거야. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 더 이상 그 곳에 가고 싶지 않아요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 왜?  
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 줄리엣 말이 맞았어요. 무슨 일이 있어도 우린 이 섬에 떠나가야 해요. 저 사람들은 헬리콥터도 있고 배도 있어요. 우리도 방법을 찾아봐요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 무슨 일이 있어도 당신과 우리 아이를 지켜줄 거야. 맹세할께. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 고마워요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 나한테 한 가지만... 솔직히 말해줄래? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 뭐든지. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: Is... the baby... mine?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 네, 진수씨. 하늘에 맹세코 당신 아이 맞아요. 정말이예요. 자기 너무 사랑해요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 난 당신이 날 떠난 줄 알았어. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 나도 사랑해. 나 당신과 절대 헤어지지 않을 거야. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 안녕하십니까. 백 자동차사의 회장님이 보내서 온 권진수라고 합니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 MAN IN SUIT: 예? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 대사님이 오늘 손주를 보셨다고 하셔서 선물을 전해드리러 왔습니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 MAN IN SUIT: 여기서 기다리세요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 참, 남자아이입니까 여자아이입니까? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 MAN IN SUIT: 남자아이입니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 AMBASSADOR: 네. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 네, 대사님. 이 팬더는 대국 중국에서 사업을 시작하겠다는 백 회장님의 뜻이 담겨 있습니다. 부디 오늘 같은 기쁜 날 이 선물을 받아 주시면 감사하겠습니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 AMBASSADOR: 회장님에게 전해주게. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 NURSE: 어, 벌써 가세요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 제 아이도 아닌데, 뭐. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 NURSE: 언젠가는 좋은 날이 오겠죠. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 JIN: 시간이 충분히 있어요. 이제 결혼한 지 두달 밖에 안 됐거든요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: I can't believe you came all this way.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 HURLEY: Are you kidding? Is anyone else coming?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 HURLEY: Good. So... where is she?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 HURLEY: She's awesome.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Would you like to hold her?
Lost.Season04.Episode07 HURLEY: I don't know, I... kinda have two left hands.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: I trust you.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 HURLEY: Wow... she looks just like Jin.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN:  Yes. She does.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 HURLEY: So... I guess we should, like, go see him.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: Of course.
Lost.Season04.Episode07 SUN: 여보... 여보 말이 맞았어요. 딸이예요. 나 정말 견디기 힘들었어요. 의사 선생님 말로는... 나 계속 당신만 찾았대. 당신이 옆에 있었으면 참 좋았을텐데... 진수 씨, 우리 딸 예쁘죠? 아기 이름은... 당신이 원하는 대로 지연이라고 지었어요. 자기 너무 보고 싶어. 너무 보고 싶어. 
Lost.Season04.Episode08 LOCKE: Thank you all for your patience. I know it's taken me a few days to... figure out our next move, but I didn't want to do anything until I knew more about our situation. You deserve to know everything that I do, so... no more secrets. As you all know, Miles here and three of his people came to the Island about a week ago. So I brought him up from the boathouse to share with us exactly why they're here.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MILES: We're here for him.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 HURLEY: Um, we kind of, like, knew that forever ago.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, all right then. Problem solved. How soon do we turn him over?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 LOCKE: We can't turn him over.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAWYER: And why the hell not?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: Because once they have me, their orders are to kill everyone else on the Island.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CLAIRE: Wait. So... what, he's one of us now? You're—you're gonna protect him? He tried to kill you, John.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 HURLEY: Yeah. He won't even tell us who his spy on the boat is.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: It's Michael.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: My spy on the freighter is Michael.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAWYER: I'm sorry. You mean the same guy that killed two women in cold blood to set this little bastard free? And then sold all of us out so he could get off the island? That Michael?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 LOCKE: Yes, James.  That Michael.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 GAULT: The rules of desertion... still apply to everyone.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 GAULT:  Nobody leaves this ship without my say-so! I'm not beating these men to scare you! I beat them to save your lives! Do you remember what happened to the last two men who took off in this boat?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 GAULT: You remember what happened to Minkowski? As soon as we get the engines fixed, we're back in the hunt. In the meantime, everybody just hold on. Johnson!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yes, sir.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 GAULT: Clean this mess up.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yes, sir.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID: Hello, Michael.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  Not now, man. 
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID: Yes. Right now.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID: Why are you on this boat?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: I'm here to die.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAWYER: Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAWYER: That's a nice meetin', John, but I thought there wasn't gonna be more secrets.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 JOHN: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAWYER: I'm talking about the 3 million bucks your buddy here asked for.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAWYER: Well?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 JOHN: Yeah. Miles offered his loyalty in exchange for the money. But as I haven't seen a bank on the island, I didn't think it worth mentioning.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAWYER: Somethin' funny?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MILES: Linus will find a way to get it.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAWYER: And how will he do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MILES: He wants to survive. And considering a week ago you had a gun to his head, and tonight he's eating pound cake... I'd say he's a guy who gets what he wants.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CLAIRE: It's fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KARL: Okay, thanks.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: Bye.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CLAIRE: Bye, guys.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: Bye.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: Alex?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: May I have a word with you?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: I think we've heard enough from you for one night.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: I'm sorry, you're just gonna have to listen to a little more.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: It's okay. What do you want?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: This is a map to the Temple.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: It's a sanctuary. It may be the last safe place on this island.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KARL: How come we don't know about this?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: Well, it wouldn't be a sanctuary if I told everyone, would it? The rest of our people are already there. If you leave now, you can get there in a day and a half.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KARL: If it's safe, why don't we all go — Hurley, Claire, the baby?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: Because the Temple's not for them, Karl. It's only for us. These people that are coming — they know who I am, Alex. They're here to capture me. They'll kill anybody that gets in their way. If they knew who you were, that you were my daughter, they would use you to get to me. We don't have much time.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KARL: Maybe he's right.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: I agree. We should go.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: These people — you said they're dangerous. More dangerous than you?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: Yes. But your mother will protect you.  Okay, now go.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID: Where is he?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CREW-MEMBER: Engine room.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID: You sure?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CREW-MEMBER: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID:  He's in the engine room.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: I don't understand, It should be working.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 JEFF: Gaskets are all corroded.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Can I help you?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID: The captain sent us down to help with the repairs.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Oh, thanks. We're okay. Hey, Jeff, man, you know what? We need a pressure valve. You mind grabbing one from the, uh, supply room?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 JEFF: Not at all.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: You shouldn't be here.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Hey! Uhh! Aah!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 DESMOND: Hey Sayid, what are you doing?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID: Why are you here?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Listen, if they see me talking to you—
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID: Then talk quickly!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: You won't understand it!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID: I'll understand perfectly, Michael. You just start from the beginning and explain how you came to be on this boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: I'm sorry 
Lost.Season04.Episode08 LIBBY: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you, Mr. Dawson.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: It's... what happened to me?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 LIBBY: You were in a car accident. It's a miracle you're alive.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: How badly am I hurt?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 LIBBY: Shh. You just need to rest now.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 LIBBY: It's a cold night.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Uhh!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 LIBBY: I brought you some extra blankets.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Aah!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NURSE: Ah. Let's get some light in here. Now, I thought I heard someone shout, and something tells me it wasn't him. You okay?  You're lucky to be alive. E.M.T. say they found you in a wrecked car with a note pinned to your chest. You didn't have any I.D. on you. Want to tell me your name?  Yeah, I didn't think so. You want me to call Walt?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  What?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NURSE: The note pinned to your chest. It was written to "Walt." You want me to call him?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  No.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NURSE: Okay, then.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Hey, ma.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Can I... come in?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL'S MOTHER: No. You know the answer to that.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: I wanna see him.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL'S MOTHER: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Just let me talk—
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL'S MOTHER: I don't know what you said to that boy, but whatever it was, he doesn't want to see you.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Please, ma. He's my son. I have a right—
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL'S MOTHER: I thought you were dead! They said your plane crashed in the middle of the ocean, but you show up here fine and dandy, only I can't tell anybody about you or Walt, can't call you by your real names. He barely talks to me, but he does wake up screaming in the middle of the night, and I'm the one that's got to tell him it's gonna be okay. So until you can explain to me where you were for over two months and what happened... you gave up your rights.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Will you, uh... will you tell him I love him?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL'S MOTHER: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 GUS: What can I do for ya?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: How much can I get for that?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 GUS: Why is there Chinese writing all over it?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: It's Korean, man — the guy who gave it to me.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 GUS: You don't look like you speak Korean. I'll give you $300 for it.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: I'm not looking for money.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 GUS: What are you looking for?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: I want a gun. I want a gun with bullets.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  Come on. Let's just get this done. Help me just get this done.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MAN: Excuse me, sir. You got the time?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  No, man. No.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MAN: Come on, Michael.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: How about for an old friend?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Manhattan, huh? We let you leave one island, you just go to another one.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Uhh!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Will you just relax? I just came here to—ooh!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Uhh!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Now are you ready to talk? Like adults?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Enough!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Do it. Go ahead, do it!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM:  You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: How do you find me?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: We're the ones who sent you home, Michael. Did you honestly think we weren't gonna keep tabs?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: What do you want?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Your help.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Why would I help the son of a bitch who kidnapped my son?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: We gave him back to you in one piece, Mike, you're the one who lost him. You told him, didn't you? You couldn't carry the guilt of what you did to those two women all by yourself, so you shared it with a 10-year-old kid. Is that why you want to kill yourself, Michael? Because that's the way he looks at you now? Because he knows you're a murderer?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Go away!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: I got some bad news for you, amigo. You can't kill yourself. The Island won't let you!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  What'd you say?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: No matter how bad you want to, no matter how many different ways you try, it won't happen.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Give it a shot if you don't believe me. You got more work to do, Mike. When you figure that out, I'm in the penthouse at the Hotel Earle.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MALE ANNOUNCER: Let's give a warm Hollywood welcome to your host...
Lost.Season04.Episode08 GAME SHOW HOST: ...our jump-ball category... literature. I hope you stayed awake during high school English. All right...
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  Ahh...
Lost.Season04.Episode08 GAME SHOW HOST: ...Slaughterhouse-Five?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 FEMALE CONTESTANT: Um, is it Kurt Vonnegut?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 GAME SHOW HOST: Correct! And triple your puzzle points in the next round—can you give us the name of the book's protagonist?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MAN: We interrupt this program for a news bulletin.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 FEMALE ANCHOR: The wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 has been found. This footage confirms the airplane did, in fact, crash at sea.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 FEMALE ANCHOR: At these tremendous depths, there is little hope of recovering any remains. Investigators are equally skeptical about the chances of retrieving Oceanic 815's black box. The real story behind what happened to this fateful airliner may have been lost along with the 324 passengers onboard. But even with this tragic discovery, the victims' families were hoping today...
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: I didn't expect you that fast.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Mm.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ARTURO: Is this the guy who hit you with the champagne bottle?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Yeah, but I had it comin'. 
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Arturo, Michael and I have some business we have to attend to. Would you get some air?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ARTURO: Of course.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ARTURO: Ciao.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Help yourself to the chow.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Don't make it to the mainland too often—
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: —so when I do, I like to indulge myself.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: So you people can just... come and go?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Some of us. You want a drink?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: What I want is for you to tell me what my plane is doing at the bottom of the ocean.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM:  That's not your plane. It's a phony. A man named Widmore put it down there, and he staged the whole wreck.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Staged? Why would he stage a—
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Because he doesn't want anyone else finding where the real plane ended up... except for him.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: I'm supposed to believe this?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM:  Did the bullet bounce off your skull, or did the gun just jam on you?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Prove it.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Sorry?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Prove that this guy, Widmore, did what you say he did. Prove it.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: That's the cemetery in Thailand where Widmore dug up the 300-odd corpses he needed. And the purchase order for the old 777 he bought through a shell company, and the shipping logs for the freighter he used to drop the whole mess down a trench deep enough to guarantee that no remains are ever gonna be identified. Do you have any idea what it would cost to bring those bodies up?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Whatchyou want from me, man?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: In a few days, a freighter is porting in Fiji. It's Widmore's boat. We have reason to believe he's finally found the coordinates of the Island, and he's heading right for it. So congratulations, Michael. Your shore leave is over. You just got a job on that boat. Meet Kevin Johnson.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: You're joining the crew in Fiji as a deckhand.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: You want me to go undercover? Why the hell would I go back to work for you people?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Because if Widmore finds the Island, it's good night for everybody on it. He'll kill them all without thinking twice. You wanna redeem yourself for what you did? This is your only chance. You can save all their lives.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: No. I can't. I can't go back to that island.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: I didn't say you were going back to the Island. You're not going on that boat so you can swab decks, Michael.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: You're going so you can kill everyone onboard.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MINKOWSKI: Hey. You our engineer?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Nah. Just a deckhand.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MINKOWSKI: Well, we're all equals on this boat... as long as you play decent hold'em. I'm George... Minkowski.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Kevin Johnson.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MINKOWSKI: Ah, nice to meet you, Kevin. All right, well, why don't you go check in with Naomi over there? And, uh, I'll be seeing you. Welcome.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NAOMI: Okay. You're good to go. Thanks.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Uh... I'm reporting for duty. Kevin Johnson.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NAOMI: Naomi Dorrit. Pleasure. So you're from the States, yeah?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: New York.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NAOMI: Yeah, I could tell from the accent.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Manchester?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NAOMI: How'd you guess? You can head onboard. Oh, uh, one of these crates was delivered for you.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NAOMI: I'll have it delivered to your berth?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yeah. Thanks.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NAOMI: Welcome aboard, Kevin.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MILES: Your name isn't Kevin.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MILES: Don't worry. Eighty percent of the people on this boat are lying about something. Orange?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: No, thanks.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yeah?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: How was your trip?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: I figure flying can't be too much fun for you.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: What do you want?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: You get your care package?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Wait a day or two until you're out in the open sea, then you're good to go.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NAOMI: You can stow your gear downstairs, all right? Welcome aboard, Keamy.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Oh, you met some of 'em now. Got some names and faces, and you're gettin' cold feet, huh?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yeah, actually, I am.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Well, here are a few more names for ya—Sun, Sawyer, Jack, Claire, her baby. And the only way you're gonna save their lives is if you man up and get on that boat. Or maybe you wanna come back and explain to your kid how you let all of them die, too. It's game time. Are you in or out?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  I'm in.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 TOM: Good, then ditch your phone and go do your job.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NAOMI: Sorry, Frank, but I'm going first and that's all there is to it.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 FRANK: No offense, but I was flying these things when you were still in grade school. If anybody's gotta go first, it should be me.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NAOMI: Yeah, I need you here to transport the science team, Frank.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 FRANK: What the hell are you gonna be doing?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 NAOMI: That's need-to-know. You don't.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 FRANK:  So much for the fairer sex, huh?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 FRANK: Frank Lapidus, chopper pilot.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Kevin Johnson. Deckhand.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 FRANK: So what's your story, Kevin?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Sorry?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 FRANK: How'd you end up on this tub?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Um... looking for a little adventure.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 FRANK: Ah, adventure. Yeah. Well,  how do you like this for adventure? You ever hear about Oceanic 815?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 FRANK: What would you say if I told you the plane they found in that trench wasn't Oceanic 815?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Then what is it?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 FRANK: You know those nuts that think the moon landing was faked? Well, this is like that... only real. That's why I signed up for this trip, because the owner of this boat believes me. Charles Widmore. He believes that 815 is still out there somewhere. (Whispering) I mean, can you imagine what would happen... if we found some of those people alive?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KEAMY: Pull!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CREWMAN: Whoo!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KEAMY: Pull!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KEAMY: Pull!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KEAMY: Another clip.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CREWMAN: Good job.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KEAMY: Pull!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KEAMY: Kill shot!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CREWMAN: Yeah!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CREWMAN: Whoo!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: What are you guys doing?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KEAMY: What's it look like we're doing? We're shooting things. Pull!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CREWMAN: Whoo.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: I, uh... thought we were going on a rescue mission.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KEAMY: Uh... don't you have something to mop up?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CREWMAN: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CREWMAN: Come on. Let's go.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KEAMY: Pull!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KEAMY:  Pull!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  You can do this, man. You can do this. 7... 1... 7-7-6. Okay. Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 CASS ELLIOT:  ...but it's getting better...
Lost.Season04.Episode08 LIBBY: Don't do it, Michael.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  I love you, Walt.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MINKOWSKI: What, are you going Nicholson on us?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MINKOWSKI: You know, Jack Nicholson in The Shining, when he's bouncing that ball against the wall? Next thing you know, you're gonna go after your wife with an ax.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: I'm not married, man.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MINKOWSKI: Well, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you got a call.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: A call?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MINKOWSKI: Yeah. From the mainland. They patched it through to the radio room.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: It's gotta be a mistake, man. Nobody even knows I'm here.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MINKOWSKI: Well, you're the only Kevin Johnson onboard, so somebody knows you're here. Said he really needs to talk to you. His name's Walt.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MINKOWSKI: Yeah, here you go.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Hey, uh ... it's kind of personal. Mind if I take this alone?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MINKOWSKI: Take your time, Kev. You just push this yellow button (indicates a switch from "Channel A" to "Channel B") and, uh, turn this knob on the console .
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Got it. Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Walt?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: I'm so sorry, Michael, but he's still in New York.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: So I'm afraid you're stuck with me. Michael? Are you still there?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: You put me on this boat, talked me into blowing it up, and when I push the damn button, a flag pops up.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: You actually activated the bomb?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL:  It's not a bomb! It's a...  it's a joke.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: There are people on your boat who are innocent. They have no idea that the man they work for is a monster, a killer without conscience or a greater purpose. I had to show you the difference between him and me. When I'm at war, I'll do what I need to do to win, but I will not kill innocent people.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Ana Lucia and Libby... they were innocent.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: You killed them, Michael. No one asked you to... I don't blame you, Michael. We did have your boy. And what wouldn't a man do for his son?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: What do you want... from me?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: I want you to compile a list of names... every person on your boat. When I call again, you'll give me that list. Then you will disable the radio room you're sitting in. When the crew is disoriented by their lack of communication, you'll take out the engines too. That way, the boat can never get to this island, and your friends will be safe. Will you do that for me, Michael?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 BEN: Then consider yourself one of the good guys.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID: So you're telling me... that you're working for Benjamin Linus?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Hey! Aah!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 DESMOND: Hey, Sayid.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Guys!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 MICHAEL: Hold it! Uhh! Let me go! What are you doing?!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID: Shut your mouth!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 GAULT: What the hell is this?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 SAYID: This man is not who you think he is. He was a passenger on Oceanic Flight 8-1-5. I spent two months with him on the island before he betrayed us. This is the man who sabotaged your radio room. He destroyed the ship's engine, and his name isn't Kevin Johnson. It's Michael Dawson, and he's a traitor.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: We stop here and drink. Two minutes, then we keep moving.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: What's wrong?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KARL: Nothing.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: Karl.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KARL: I don't know. I just have a bad feeling about this. What if your dad is... playing us?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: Look, I don't like taking orders from my dad any more than you do. But I know he doesn't want me to get hurt.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KARL: Well, at least we've got something in common.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: I promise not to tell if you won't.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 KARL: Uhh!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: Alex!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX:  Karl?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: Alex!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: Karl! Karl, Karl! No!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: Come on.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: No! No!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: Come on! He's gone.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX:  Karl!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: Alex!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: No! No, no, we have to get Karl. Karl!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: He's gone.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: Karl!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: He's gone! He's gone! Listen to me.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: No. 
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: I need you to take my hand. On the count of three, we're going to run.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: Can you do that with me? I love you. I love you very much, Alexandra.
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: Are you ready?
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: One...
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: Two...
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ROUSSEAU: Three!
Lost.Season04.Episode08 ALEX: Wait! Wait! Don't! I'm Ben's daughter! I'm his daughter!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KATE: You got a prescription for that?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: Yeah. I wrote it myself.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KATE: You look terrible.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: Well, thanks.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KATE: What are those?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: Antibiotics. I just got a... a stomach bug.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KATE: You should eat some crackers. Crackers always make me feel better.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KATE: Why aren't they back from the boat yet, Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: Well, Sayid said the engine was down. My guess is they're trying to fix it and wondering why the hell they can't get in touch with us.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KATE: And you're not worried?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: No. My gut says we're getting off this island.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KATE: I thought your gut was sick.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BERNARD:  Help! I need some help! Help!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BERNARD: Help! I need help! I need some help down here!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BERNARD: The dog was barking. I didn't see him.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: Do you know who this is?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DANIEL: He was on our boat. He's the doctor.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: We're all gonna die.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Calm down, Chicken Little. The sky ain't falling just yet.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: This is exactly what he wants—to fight amongst ourselves. You're making a big mistake, dude.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: It's his to make, Hugo.  Let's get on with it.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Right... I'm attackin' Siberia.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER:  Sorry.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: Can't believe you're just giving him Australia. Australia's the key to the whole game.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Says you.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: Stop here. On your knees. Get on your knees.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: Hey. Turn this thing off.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 ALEX: P-please. There's a baby with them. Just promise you won't—
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: Turn the fence off.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 ALEX: Okay. It's off.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:  Code 14-J. Code 14-J.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: Who is it?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: I think it's for Ben.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: What's "code 14-J"?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Where did you hear that?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: The phone rang. I picked it up. A voice kept repeating, "code 14-J."
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: We need to get to the other house. It's easier to fortify, and we'll have better position on the tree lines.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: They're here.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SUBTITLE: Sahara Desert
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Hello.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: No, no, no, no. Wait.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 RED: 
Lost.Season04.Episode09 GRAY:  Look around! He doesn't have any trail.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 RED:  Where did he come from? Fell from the sky?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Wait. I can explain. D-do you speak English?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN:  Do you speak Arabic? 
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN:  Do you speak Turkish? 
Lost.Season04.Episode09 GRAY:  Do not move! 
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Sure. Sure.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Ah. Okay. Okay, okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN:  This...
Lost.Season04.Episode09 GRAY:  What is this? 
Lost.Season04.Episode09 GRAY:  What is this? 
Lost.Season04.Episode09 GRAY: Surrender! Surrender!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Oh, so you do speak English.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN:  Yah!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Let me guess. "14-J" ain't the code for the pizza boy.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: It's an early warning system.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Warning for what?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Somebody tripped the panic switch at our security fence. That means one of my people's been captured.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: How long did you guys debate amongst yourselves whether or not to ask me why the phone rang?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE:  Five minutes.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Well, so much for our head start.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Hold up. If we're hunkerin' down, I gotta grab Frenchie and the kids.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Don't bother. They're safe. I sent Rousseau, Alex and Karl away yesterday.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER:  Away where?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Whatever. Claire's still sleepin'. I'll grab her.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: There's no time!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: I'll make time.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: It's very important that you survive what's about to happen here, John. So I need you to stay close to me.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: And why would I do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Because the people that are coming won't risk hurting me. You want to live? I'm your best chance.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: His throat was slit.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: Know anything about that?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DANIEL: No. Uh, he was fine when I last saw him.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: Which was when?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DANIEL: When? "When" is kind of a relative term.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 CHARLOTTE: We don't know anything about this.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JULIET: Any luck fixing the sat phone?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DANIEL: Uh, yeah. Sorry, no. The, uh, the mic was... smashed up pretty good. Best-case scenario, we'd only be able to broadcast tone squelch. Beeps and boops.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BERNARD: Well, yeah, but you could still use it as sort of a telegraph, right?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DANIEL: If I had some strips of ferrous metal, uh, a 9-volt battery clip and some ... wiring.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KATE: We got a bunch of stuff that we salvaged from the plane.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DANIEL: Great.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KATE: I'll show you where it is.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: Bernard, you got a second?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: These people who are coming — you're scared of 'em, aren't you?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: That's right, John. I am.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: What's going on?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Get away from the window, Hugo.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: How's Sawyer gonna get back in?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: He's not.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Hey! You see if Claire left her house this morning?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DOUG: What's going on? Why do you have that? 
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER:  Just get back inside and wait until—
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYWER:  Get back inside!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER:  Get inside!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER:  Claire!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Claire!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: CLAIRE!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 NARJISS: Good afternoon, sir.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Good afternoon. I'd like a room, please.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 NARJISS: Of course, sir. Is this your first time in Tunisia?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: No. But it's been a while.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 NARJISS: Your name?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I'm actually a preferred guest. It should be under "Dean Moriarty."
Lost.Season04.Episode09 NARJISS: Certainly, Mr. Moriarty.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 NARJISS: May I help you with anything else?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Yes. Um, today's date is...
Lost.Season04.Episode09 NARJISS: October 24th, sir.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN:  2005?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 NARJISS: Yes, sir. 2005.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYID:  I just want to bury my wife in peace.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Right now, I need you to tell me what's going on.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I think the technical term is "shock and awe." They're trying to frighten me into surrendering.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Well, why did they stop shooting?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: Was that Claire's house?! Claire was there!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Hugo, get the baby away from the window. Put him in the back room.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: You said I need to survive this. Why?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Because there's only one person that can help us now, and that's Jacob, and we have to go to him together.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: What makes you think I can find him? I—I don't even know where the cabin is.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I know, but Hurley does.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Claire! Claire! Claire!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Claire!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Are you okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 CLAIRE:  Charlie?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 CLAIRE: Where's Aaron? Where's Aaron?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: He's with us. It's okay. We're gonna move now. Let's go.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER:  Open the front door!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Hugo, you don't want to do that.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Open the damn door!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER:  Open the door! Open the damn door!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Careful.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Is she all right?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: She got her bell rung, but she's gonna be all right.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: They just started shootin'. Why? Why slaughter people without even telling us what they want?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Those people were murdered to make you angry, James. So you'd be more likely to come storming in here and throw me to the wolves.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Yeah, what's wrong with that? Sounds like a great plan to me.  What do you say, on three?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN:  I wouldn't if I were you.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Shut up!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Miles?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Who the hell let you out?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 MILES: The people who gave me this.  They want to talk.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SUBTITLE: Tikrit, Iraq
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYID: You vultures, you followed me to Tikrit? You spy on me?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYID: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I'm here to find the man who murdered your wife.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYID: How did you get here?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I came across the Syrian border. It's really not as difficult as you might—
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYID: How did you get off the island?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Your friend Desmond had a boat. Remember? The Elizabeth. I followed a heading to Fiji. Then I chartered a plane.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYID: Why now?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: You remember the name Charles Widmore, don't you? The man who tried to convince the world that your plane was on the bottom of the ocean?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYID: What does it have to do with me? With Nadia?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: There was a man at her procession. He goes by the name of Ishmael Bakir. He's one of Widmore's men.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Bakir was last seen five days ago in Los Angeles, caught by a traffic camera, speeding away from the corner of La Brea and Santa Monica.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYID: That's three blocks from where Nadia was killed.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYID: Why would these people want to murder her?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I don't know. But they did.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: How many of 'em are there?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 MILES: Maybe six. I'm not sure.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: The hell you mean, you ain't sure? You came over on the same boat with 'em, didn't ya?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 MILES: They told me they were just security.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Security for what?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 MILES:  For him. Once they got him, to escort him back to the mainland.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Well, Miles, sounds like you're not gonna collect your 3.2 million dollars.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 MILES: Just take it. 
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Why would I talk to them?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 MILES: Because they have a hostage.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Well, then they've badly miscalculated, 'cause every single one of my people is prepared to die in service to this island.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 MILES: It's your daughter!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY:  Am I speaking to Benjamin Linus?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: That's right.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: My name is Martin Keamy. I'm an employee of Charles Widmore.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER:  Who's Charles Widmore?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Later.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: I'd like you to go look out your east window so we can talk about this face-to-face.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: To the left. You see me?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Yeah, I see you.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: All right, Mr. Linus, these are my terms: You're gonna step out the front door, put your hands above your head, and you're gonna walk straight to me. Once I have you in my custody, then I promise you that no one else in that house will be harmed.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: You and I both know that once you have me, there's nothing to stop you from killing everybody else on this island.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY:  What kind of guy do you think I am?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Martin Christopher Keamy — former first sergeant, United States Marine Corps, served with distinction from 1996 to 2001, but since then, you've worked with a number of mercenary organizations, specifically in Uganda. So I know exactly what kind of man you are, Mr. Keamy, and we can dispense with the formalities.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: Okay, Ben. You got it.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: Get down.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY:  Get your ass out here right now... or I'm gonna kill your daughter.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I'd like to present a counterproposal.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: I'm listening.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: You and your friends... you turn around. Walk back to your helicopter. You fly away and forget you ever heard of this island.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: Tell your daddy goodbye.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 ALEX:  Dad... they're serious. They killed Karl and my mother.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Alex... I have this under control. Everything's gonna be okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 ALEX: Please, daddy! Just please, please...
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: You have 10 seconds, Ben.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Okay, listen.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: Nine...
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: She's not my daughter.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KEAMY: Eight...
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I stole her as a baby from an insane woman. She's a pawn, nothing more. She means nothing to me. I'm not coming out of this house. So if you want to kill her, go ahead and do it—
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: I don't see 'em. They just left her body there and disappeared into the jungle.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: They won't be gone for long. It's gonna be dark in about 20 minutes, and then they're gonna come for him.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Then let's just hand him over.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: I don't think these people have any intentions of letting us walk out of here alive, James, no matter what we do.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Well, I ain't got no intention of dyin'.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: He changed the rules.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: What? Who? What rules?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER:  You know I'm right.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Our best chance here is to toss him out and fend for ourselves.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Hey! Where you goin'?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Open this damn door! Open up!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BAKIR: Walk.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BAKIR: Who are you and why are you following me?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: My name is Benjamin Linus...
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: ...and I need you to take a message to Mr. Widmore for me.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BAKIR: And what message is that?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: That should do it.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYID: Wait. Where do you think you're going?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: We're finished here, Sayid. Turn around and walk away. Mourn your loss. Get on with your life.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYID: I have no life. They took it from me.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Go home, Sayid. Once you let your grief become anger, it will never go away. I speak from experience. This is my war. It's not yours.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAYID: I spent the last eight years of my life searching for the woman I love. I finally found her and I married her. And I buried her yesterday. So don't tell me this is not my war. Benjamin... Who's next?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I'll be in touch.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Open the damn door! Son of a bitch just left us here. Open the damn door!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 CLAIRE: What's going on?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Claire?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: You all right, sweetheart?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 CLAIRE: Yeah, a bit wobbly, but, uh, I'll live.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 MILES: Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Excuse me, James.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: 'Scuse you?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: What were you doing in there?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Okay, listen to me very carefully: I need all of you to do exactly as I say. In a minute, we have to run from this house as fast as we can. At that moment, when I give the order, I want you to head straight for the tree line.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: You mean towards the guys with guns?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: No, we want to be as far away from them as possible.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Okay, outside. Outside now!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: What did you do?!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: Did you just call that thing?!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DISTANT VOICE: Fall back!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER:  Go! Go, go!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Head for the trees. I'll catch up with you.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Hey, where are you going?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I have to say good-bye to my daughter, John.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DANIEL: I can't believe it. Might actually have a signal.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: What are you sending?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DANIEL:  "What... happened... to... the... doctor?"
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DANIEL: Okay. They didn't exactly say what happened to the doctor, but your friends are fine, and the helicopter's coming back in—in the morning.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK:  Well...
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BERNARD: He's lying. What the message said was, "What are you talking about? The doctor is fine."
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DANIEL:  You know Morse code.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: What does that mean, "The doctor is fine"?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DANIEL: I don't know.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: Why are you lying? Why did you say that the helicopters are coming back?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KATE: Jack!
Lost.Season04.Episode09 JACK: Were you ever... gonna take us off this island?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DANIEL: ...No. No, no.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 KATE: Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: I think your chopper buddies ran that way, if you wanna catch up.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 MILES: Yeah, I think I'll stay with you guys for—for now.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Sorry about your daughter.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Thank you, John.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: That being said, you lied to me. You told me you didn't know what the smoke monster was.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: You can ask Jacob all about it when we go to the cabin.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Hang on. "Jacob"? Who the hell's Jacob?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: He's the man that's gonna tell us what to do next, James.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: You know what? I'm done with all this. I never should have followed you wackos in the first place. I'm goin' back to the beach, and Claire and the kid are comin' with me.  You good with that?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 CLAIRE: Yeah, I'm good with that.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 MILES: I'm coming with you.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Let's go. You too, Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Have you lost your mind?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Hugo stays with us.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Not a chance.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: Wait. Leave me out of this.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: I'm sorry, Hugo. We need you to find the cabin.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: He ain't goin' anywhere with you, you crazy son of a bitch.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: Stop! Put the guns down. I'll go with Locke.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Hugo.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: It's okay, Sawyer.  Please, put your gun down.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY:  You too.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: You don't have to do this.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 HURLEY: You guys go back to the beach. I'll catch up sooner or later.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER:  You harm so much as one hair on his curly head... I'll kill you.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Fair enough.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SAWYER: Let's go. Go. Move.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 LOCKE: Which way?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Follow me.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 SUBTITLE: London, England.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DOORMAN: Good evening, sir. May I help you?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN:  Oh, yes. I'm here to see Mr. and Mrs. Kendrick in 4E.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DOORMAN:  At this hour, sir?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN:  They're expecting me.  Feel free to call up.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 DOORMAN: No need, sir. Good night, sir.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Wake up, Charles.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 WIDMORE: I wondered when you were gonna show up. I see you've been getting more sun.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: Iraq is lovely this time of year. When did you start sleeping with a bottle of scotch by the bed?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 WIDMORE: When the nightmares started.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 WIDMORE: Have you come here to kill me, Benjamin?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: We both know I can't do that.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 WIDMORE: Then why are you here?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I'm here, Charles, because you murdered my daughter.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 WIDMORE: Don't stand there, looking at me with those horrible eyes of yours and lay the blame for the death of that poor girl on me, when we both know very well I didn't murder her at all, Benjamin — you did.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: No, that's not true.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 WIDMORE: Yes, Benjamin, it is. You creep into my bedroom in the dead of night — like a rat — and have the audacity to pretend that you're the victim?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 WIDMORE: I know who you are, boy. What you are. I know that everything you have you took from me. So... once again I ask you: Why are you here?
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I'm here, Charles, to tell you that I'm going to kill your daughter. Penelope, is it? And once she's gone... once she's dead... then you'll understand how I feel. And you'll wish you hadn't changed the rules.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 WIDMORE: You'll never find her.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 WIDMORE: That island's mine, Benjamin. It always was. It will be again.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN:  But you'll never find it.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 WIDMORE: Then I suppose the hunt is on for both of us.
Lost.Season04.Episode09 BEN: I suppose it is. Sleep tight, Charles.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Jack! Jack! Jack? Jack, I need you to wake up. Jack! Can you hear me? You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: Come on! Come on! I just wanna know why.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: What happened?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Here.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ROSE: He knows somethin'!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: I want the truth!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 DANIEL: I don't know. That's the truth. I'm telling you, I don't know why, but there's no signal now.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: Signal? What, there was a signal when you called them last night.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ROSE: That's right.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: So—so—so what? Now they're just ignoring us?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CHARLOTTE: How are we supposed to know why they're not answering?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ROSE: Oh, who's talking to you?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CHARLOTTE: And in case you haven't noticed, we're not on the bloody boat, are we?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ROSE: Just watch your tone, Red.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: I just wanna know why.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Hey! Everybody just needs to calm down, okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: Jack, these people are lying to us.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I know they're lying. I know it. Sooner or later, their people are gonna come back for them, and when they do, we'll be waiting for them.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SUN: Unless they run off again.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Listen to me.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ROSE: Jack, are you all right?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: No, I'm fine. We just have to be patient, okay? I've gotten us this far. I said I was gonna get us off the Island — all of us. I promised that I would.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ROSE: Jack? Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ROSE: Is he all right?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Jack? Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JANE: Dr. Shephard? Just confirming your 11:00 consult with Ms. Berenberg. It was moved up yesterday, and I know how you are with your calendar.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Yeah. Yeah, I remember, Jane. I'll, um... I'll be in there.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JANE: Thank you, doctor.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Alright. Bye.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Ow. Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  A-Rod.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Morning.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 WOMAN: Morning yourself. I bought you a razor.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: What, you don't like the scruff?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 WOMAN:  Razor's by the sink, Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Morning.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: "Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night. Let me think. Was I the same when I got up this morning?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I?' Aha, that's the great puzzle."
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: You're a natural.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  Yeah?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: My old man used to read me that story.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Really?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: It's just... it's just sweet hearing you say nice things about your dad.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  I don't say nice things about my dad? Well, he was a good storyteller. I'll give him that. Hey. You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Yeah. Just, I... I love seeing you with him. I'm so glad you changed your mind.  I'm so glad that you're here.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  Me, too.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Keep him in the shade. I'll get him some water. Give—give him some air, guys.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Hey, what happened?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: He passed out.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: You fainted?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I'm fine. I'm just, uh... I'm just a little dehydrated.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: No, Jack. You're not okay. You're burning up.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I'm fine. I'm fine. I just... just need to get a little rest.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Jack—
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I'm fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CLAIRE: Oh!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CLAIRE: Yeah, just a bit woozy.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: How's your head?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CLAIRE: It's better. Bit of a headache, but at least I'm not seeing things anymore.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: Yeah? What'd you see?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: Back off, Donger.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: I'm just making conversation.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: Let's make some time. I wanna cover more ground before we gotta camp tonight. If we hoof it, we can make it to the beach by noon tomorrow.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: Hey. Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: Who's Danielle and Karl?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CLAIRE: Y—you mean Rousseau? The French woman?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CLAIRE:  Oh, my God.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: Is this your French woman?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: Karl. How'd you know they were down there? Your buddies do this?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: They're not my buddies, man. I didn't sign up for this.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CLAIRE: Can we just—can we just get out of here, please? Can we just go?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER:  Yeah, yeah, of course. But don't worry. Once we get back to the beach, everything's gonna be fine. All right?  Come on. Let's go.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Ahh.  I hate being sick.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: What do you think it is?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: It's food poisoning.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: What makes you think that?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I've got some cramping, dehydrated, nausea.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: I respectfully disagree.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  Do you?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: You want to lift your shirt up?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: If it's food poisoning, you got nothing to worry about.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: It's your appendix, Jack. When did the pain start?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Yesterday.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Has it ruptured?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Not yet.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Well... I guess we're just gonna have to take it out.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Do you remember where the medical station is or don't you?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SUN: Yes, I remember.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: These are the instruments that I need you to bring back. You'll find them in the drawers in the exam room.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SUN: "Clamps"? "Sutures"? Juliet, I don't know what these look like.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 DAN: I can help you. I'm familiar with surgical instruments. Uh...
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: I thought you were a physicist.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 DAN: Yeah, well, I've done some animal autopsies, too, so if—if—
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JIN: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SUN: We can't trust them.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CHARLOTTE:  See, Dan? I told you. They're convinced we're trying to kill 'em. Might as well keep playing the part.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 DAN: Damn it, Charlotte. That right there, that right there. Your—your attitude — your very bad attitude — it's exactly why they don't trust us.  Come on.  Juliet, please. Don't blame us for—for this, for whatever is happening. We're scientists. We don't want anyone to get hurt. We just wanna help. Please let us help.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET:  If either of them tries to run, shoot 'em in the leg. Get back here as fast as you can.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SUN: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 DAN: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: We need to create a sterile environment. Find a hard surface, wash it down, gather as many tarps as you can.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Hey Juliet. If everything that we need is at the medical station, then why don't we just bring Jack there?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Because if we move him, there's a good chance that his appendix will rupture. And if that happens, he's gonna die.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: Don't even think about it.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: Don't look at her. Don't talk to her. Don't mess with her. You got a restraining order. Twenty feet.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: What are you, her big brother?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: No. I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot in your face unless you say, "Yeah, I getcha."
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: Yeah, I getcha.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: Honey, I am sure Jack is gonna be okay. An appendectomy is just about the most common kind of surgery there is.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ROSE: That's not what I was thinking about. I was thinking, "Why did he get sick?"
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: Why? It's just—it's just bad luck.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ROSE: The day before we're all supposed to be rescued, the person that we count on the most suddenly comes down with a life-threatening condition, and you're chalking it up to bad luck?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: Well, what are you saying, that—that Jack did something to offend the gods? People get sick, Rose.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ROSE: Not here. Here, they get better.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: When was the last time you did this?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: An appendectomy or shaving a man's stomach?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: In my residency. I did a lot of 'em back then.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Then you know the incision needs to be two inches lower than where you're shaving.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: I'm just cleaning the area. Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I wanna talk you through it.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I don't want to be unconscious. We can use the lidocaine to numb the area. And then I can watch the procedure, help you out.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: And, uh, how are you gonna watch, flat on your back with my hand in your abdominal cavity?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: We can use a mirror. Kate can hold it.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: If someone's going to be in there, shouldn't it be someone with medical experience? Bernard's a dentist—
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: No, I want it to be Kate.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Don't worry, Ms. Berenberg. You're in good hands.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MRS. BERENBERG: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I'll see you tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MRS. BERENBERG: Mm-hmm.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: And remember, no solid food. Okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MRS. BERENBERG: Thank you, doctor.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Have a good evening.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ERIKA: Jack? Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ERIKA: Will you take a look at this X-ray? Uh, it's in the L4. I wanna know what you think.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: The L4. Yeah. Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 RECEPTIONIST: Oh, Dr. Shephard, there's a call for you. It's a Dr. Stillman from Santa Rosa Hospital, says it's about a friend of yours.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 DR. STILLMAN: He's refusing to take his meds, and he's stopped sleeping.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: What about his therapy sessions?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 DR. STILLMAN: Therapy's... been rendered useless.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: And why is that?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 DR. STILLMAN: Because he doesn't think I exist.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Hey Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 HURLEY:  Hey Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Why aren't you taking your meds?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 HURLEY: 'Cause we're dead... all of us. All the Oceanic Six, we're all dead. We never got off that island.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Hurley ... that is not true.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 HURLEY: What'd you do today?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: What did I do today? I, uh...  I woke up, took a shower. Uh, Kate and I fed the baby.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 HURLEY: I thought you didn't want anything to do with Aaron.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I changed my mind after the trial.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 HURLEY: Living with Kate... taking care of Aaron... it all seems so perfect... just like heaven.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Just because I'm happy doesn't mean that this isn't real, Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 HURLEY: I was happy too, Jack... for a while, anyway. Then I saw Charlie.  He likes to sit with me on the bench out on the front lawn. It's pretty cool, actually.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Okay.  So what did the two of you talk about?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 HURLEY: Well, yesterday, he told me you were gonna be coming by. He wanted me to give you a message.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  A message?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 HURLEY: He made me write it down so I wouldn't mess it up.  "You're not supposed to raise him, Jack."  Does that make any sense?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: No, that... doesn't make any sense.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 HURLEY: Do you think he means Aaron?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Take your meds, Hurley. Just take 'em.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 HURLEY: Hey, Jack? Charlie said someone's gonna be visiting you too. Soon.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 Sun: We're here.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 DAN: Hey. Uh... why don't you let me go first? Um, you know, make sure everything's safe.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CHARLOTTE: Okay. Be careful, Dan.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 DANIEL: Absolutely.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JIN: 저 여자는 저 남자가 좋아하는 걸 알까? 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SUN: 그럼, 여잔데… 당연히 알지. 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SUN: 어서 가요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 DANIEL: Where do you suppose all this power's coming from?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CHARLOTTE: Add that one to the list, Dan. Let's just grab the equipment and go, shall we?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JIN: 괜찮아? 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SUN: 줄리엣이 날 데리고 온 곳이에요. 여기서 우리 아기를 봤어요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SUN: 진수씨, 저 사람들이 우리를 도와 줄 것 같지 않아요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JIN: 자기야, 걱정 마. 내가 한 말 이해 가지? 당신하고 우리 아기는 이 섬에서 꼭 벗어나게 할 거야. 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: Whoa! Hey, you want a hand with the baby?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CLAIRE:  Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: You sure? I'm good with kids.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: What part of "restraining order" don't you understand?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER:  Get behind me, Claire.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 LAPIDUS: Whoa! Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: Who the hell are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: Lapidus?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 LAPIDUS: Miles?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: You two know each other?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 LAPIDUS: You gotta hide, man, right now.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 LAPIDUS: Keamy's coming back, and if he sees you, he'll kill all of ya.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 LAPIDUS: And he's close, man. You gotta hide now! Go! Hide!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: Come on.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 LAPIDUS: Just hide!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: Come on. Come on. Let's go!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KEAMY: Where's the chopper?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 LAPIDUS: It's about a click back that way.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KEAMY: Did you bring the kit?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 LAPIDUS: Yeah, it's right here. Jeez, man, he looks bad. What the hell happened?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KEAMY: You do your job. I'll do mine.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 LAPIDUS: Okay. It's gettin' dark, man. We gotta leave now.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 LAPIDUS: Mr. Keamy, we gotta get back to the chopper.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 LAPIDUS: Keamy, we gotta get back, 'cause I'll tell ya right now, I am not flying Faraday's bearings at night. I'm not gonna do it. So if you wanna get back, we gotta leave right now, sir.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KEAMY: Fine. You lead the way.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KEAMY: Come on.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MAN 1: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MAN 2: Come on.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MAN 3: Watch it now.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: The tent's all set. Everything's ready.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Good. Thanks. Listen, I could use an extra pair of hands in there. You wanna help me out?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Um, I don't... I don't think that's a good idea.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: It's just holding a mirror. Jack wants to watch the surgery, "talk me through it."
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: I'm just surprised he's not taken it out of himself by now.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Jack. What are you doin'?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I don't need a stretcher. I can walk 50 feet.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: I'll help you.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: They're gonna be back with the instruments soon. We need to be ready to go as soon as they get back. See you in there.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: So it looks like I'm gonna be your nurse.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  Wouldn't be the first time.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Listen, um... if something happens to me—
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Shut up, Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  Fair enough.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Kate? Kate?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Wake up, Kate. Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE:  Hey. What time is it?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: It's late. I just got home.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Were you working?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: No. I just... had to stop and get something. I just... took a while.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Hey. What's going on? What's wrong?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: The other night, when I was reading to Aaron, you said... that I was a natural. (Sighs) Do you really... do you really think that I'm good at this?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Yeah. You're good at this.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  Will you marry me?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Yes. 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Of course I will. Yes.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: Look, they're back.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Did you find everything?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 DANIEL: Yes, ma'am. The entire list. Is he okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: For now. Sun, we need to sterilize these. There's a pot of water boiling over here.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JIN: Charlotte.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CHARLOTTE: Yeah?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JIN: 난 알고 있어. 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CHARLOTTE: Pardon?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JIN: 너 한국말 할 줄 알지? 아까 우리가 너 이야기 할 때 너 웃는 거 내가 봤어. 그리고 너 스테이션에서도 우리 말 엿듣고 있었지? 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CHARLOTTE: I'm sorry. Perhaps I can get your wife to translate—
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JIN: 계속 날 속이면... 니 친구 다니엘을 가만 두지 않겠어. 앞으로 그 친구 손가락 쓰기는 아마 힘들걸? 이해가 되지? 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CHARLOTTE: 나한테 원하는 게 뭐죠? 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JIN: 헬리콥터가 돌아오면... 내 아내를 데리고 이 섬을 떠나기만 하면 돼. 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CHARLOTTE: 당신과 당신 친구는요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JIN: 넌 선만 헬리콥터에 태우면 돼. 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: You know, Jack, they found some chloroform at the medical station. I could knock you out. Wouldn't you rather be dreaming about something nice back home?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: No, I'll manage with the lidocaine.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Kate.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Just hold it right there.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: Okay, now this is gonna numb the area of the first incision. After that, I would like to be able to tell you you' not gonna feel a thing, but... you will.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: You ready?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Okay. Here we go.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Okay, Jack. One more.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Oh!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Okay, try not to move.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Just stay still.  Spreader.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Kate, I—I can't see it.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Sorry.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Don't worry about the mirror. Just stay still.  Spreader.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  That's good. That's good. Yeah. This is it. That's good.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Aah! 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Knock him out, Bernard.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: No! No... not wanna be unconscious.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: You don't want to be out of control.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Kate.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Kate, you need to leave.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Bernard!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Kate—
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Kate, you need to go.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: —please.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Bernard!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: No!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Kate, get out of here! Bernard.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Kate...
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: Kate. Kate, get outta here! Damn it, Bernard! Knock him out!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: I'm sorry, Jack, but I agree.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Laker, Ryan. Patient is male, 36.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Osteoblastoma is present in the posterior area of the lumbar. I am recommending biopsy for—
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CHRISTIAN: Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ERIKA: Jack?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ERIKA: You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Uh, yeah. I'm—I'm... I'm okay. I, uh... I just, uh...
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: The, um, the smoke detector was... was beeping, and I just...
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ERIKA: Okay. Thank you for keeping us safe.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Erika, um...  Do you mind doing me a favor?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ERIKA: Yeah, sure.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Can you write a script for... clonazepam?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ERIKA: For you?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Yeah, um... I just got a lot going on right now, and I'm just a little snowed under with all my caseload, and Kate and I got engaged. Just... not sleepin' very well at night, you know? Just...
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ERIKA: You know, getting engaged is supposed to help reduce stress, not create it.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Yeah.  You're right.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ERIKA: Maybe you should talk to someone.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I'll do that.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 ERIKA: Good night.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Good night.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Yeah, I'll just have the nanny stay for an extra couple hours. Jack's never home before 8:00 anyway. I could stay for at least an hour.  I—I gotta go. Jack's home. Yeah, okay. I'll call you later. Bye.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Hey. You scared me.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Sorry. I thought you'd be in bed. Who was that?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: That was Noreen.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Noreen?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Yeah. She's one of the moms from the park. What?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Nothing. I just... never heard you mention her before.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Well, now you have.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: I'll see you upstairs.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 CLAIRE: Dad?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: Hey. Don't worry. It went well. She did good. She said you could go back inside if you want to.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE:  Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 BERNARD: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: He didn't lose that much blood. I got the appendix out and put everything back where it belongs, I think.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: So he's gonna be okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: He should be fine. We just have to talk him into resting.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Good luck with that.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Don't worry about it. You had enough going on.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: You know, he kissed me.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: The other day, when you came back from the other side of the Island, Jack kissed me.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Oh.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: It was nice... but it wasn't for me. It was for him. I'm pretty sure he was trying to prove something.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Prove what?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: That he doesn't love someone else.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Thank you, Juliet. Thank you for saving his life.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JULIET: I know you're awake.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Hey. You're home early. Where's Veronica?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I sent her home. The baby's asleep.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE:  Good.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Why was she here?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Sorry?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: The nanny. She only works 'til 4:00. I came home at 6:00.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: I had to run some errands, so...  I asked her to stay a couple extra hours. What's going on, Jack? Why are you home so early?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I went to see Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Today?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Last... Friday.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Why didn't you tell me? I would've gone with you.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  Because he's crazy, Kate, and I didn't wanna upset you.  Where were you today?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: I'm gonna ask you... to trust me. Trust me. Just leave it be.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  Where were you?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE:  Jack, don't.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: No, I heard you on the phone last night. Who were you talking to?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Just let it go.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: No, no, I wanna know.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: No, Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: I wanna know where you were. I wanna know who you were with.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: It doesn't matter, Jack. Please.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: No, tell me. Tell me!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE:  I was doing something for him.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: For who?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: For Sawyer. I made him a promise. It... 
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK:  What?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: It doesn't matter. It has nothing to do with us.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Then why won't you tell me?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Because—because he wouldn't want me to.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: But he's not here, is he? No. No, he made his choice. He chose to stay. I'm the one who came back. I'm the one who's here. I'm the one who saved you.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Jack.  You can't—you can't do this. If you have problems, you need to figure them out. All right? 'Cause I can't have you like this around my son.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 JACK: Your son? You're not even related to him!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 KATE: Hey, sweet pea. Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: Morning.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: It's way too early for Chinese.  Where's Claire? Ladies' room?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: Nope. She just walked off into the jungle.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: What? When?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: In the middle of the night. Just got up and left.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: You let her go alone?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: She wasn't alone.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: Well, who was she with?
Lost.Season04.Episode10 MILES: She called him "Dad". I'd have followed them, but I have a restraining order.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: Claire! Claire!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: It's okay. It's okay. I've got you.
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: Claire! CLAIRE!
Lost.Season04.Episode10 SAWYER: CLAIRE! CLAIRE!!!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 






Lost.Season04.Episode11 MRS. LOCKE: Where do you think you're going?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 EMILY: Out.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MRS. LOCKE: With who? Him?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 EMILY: Yes, and you can't stop me. I'm in love.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MRS. LOCKE: He's twice your age, Emily.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 EMILY: So what, Mom? Are you jealous?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MRS. LOCKE: Emily, wait a minute. Emily, listen to me!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MRS. LOCKE: Emily! Get back here, young lady, right now!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 EMILY: You can't stop me! I love him!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MRS. LOCKE: Emily! Emily—
Lost.Season04.Episode11 EMILY: Aah!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE:  Honey? Honey, can you hear me? Honey, can you hear me?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE:  That's good. Try and stay awake now. Must be internal. Keep it steady. Out of the way. Pulse! She's bleeding. Her heartbeat's dropping fast.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 EMILY: I'm pregnant.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: What? What did you say?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 EMILY: I'm pregnant. I'm five—I'm almost six months.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: She—she's pregnant.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 DOCTOR: Get the clamps ready.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: That's it, Emily. Good girl.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 DOCTOR: Baby's crowning.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: She's crowning.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 DOCTOR: Dilated and ready to go. Here we go. That's it.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: Okay, sweetheart.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: All right, there you go.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: Wrap you up nice and warm. We'll just take you over here now. Margaret, would you put him in for me, please?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 EMILY: My baby.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: It's a boy, honey. He's okay for now. He's just real early.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 EMILY: Can I hold him?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: I'm really sorry, sweetheart. He's just too little. We have to take him away now.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 EMILY: But...  name—name him John. Please! His name is John!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Who builds a cabin in the middle of the jungle anyway?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: That's a good question.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: So? How about answering it?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: I don't know.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: And why are we even going there?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Because hopefully, the man who lives in the cabin can tell us what to do about the people who are trying to kill us.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: We've been walking all day. Are we gonna get there soon?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE:  How long?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: I don't know. I've been following him.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: What? What do you mean, you've been following him?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: I'm not even in front.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: I have no idea where the cabin is. Hugo's the last one who saw it.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Oh, this is just awesome.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: What do you think we should do, John?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: We're making camp.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: What? Here in the dark with the monster and... him?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Well, the rest will do us good.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Dude, what's gonna happen when those freighter guys come back?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: I don't know... yet.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 SAYID: Desmond. The helicopter's here.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: All right, get him on the litter. Careful with him! Get him down over there. Be careful. Okay guys, unload it. Come on. Pick it up, pick it up. Let's go.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RAY: What did this to him?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY:  A black pillar of smoke threw him 50 feet in the air... ripped his guts out.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RAY: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: I need you to tell me exactly how many people are on that island, and where every single one of them is.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 SAYID: And why would I do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: Keamy! What the hell do you think you're doing, mate?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: You gave me up.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Linus knew who I was. He knew my name. He knew everything about me.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: No, I'm not the one who gave you up.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Then who did?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MICHAEL: Aah! Oh! Oh!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MICHAEL: Ohh!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Do you know who I am?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MICHAEL:  What?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: My name. Do you know my name?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MICHAEL: Keamy. Martin Keamy.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Did you give it to him?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MICHAEL: Who?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Benjamin Linus—did you give him my name?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MICHAEL: Yeah. 
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: Wait. Wait! Martin, no!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: Martin, we need him. He's the only one who can fix the engines.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: And what makes you so sure about that?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: Because he's the one who broke them.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HORACE: Hello there.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Who are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HORACE: I'm Horace. Whew!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: And what are you doing out here?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HORACE: Oh, building a place—a little getaway for me and the missus. No, I mean, sometimes you need a break from the D.I., y'know? The DHARMA Initiative?  I'm not making any sense, am I?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HORACE: That's probably because I've been dead for 12 years.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HORACE: Hello there. You gotta find me, John. You gotta find me. And when you do, you'll find him.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Who?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HORACE: Jacob.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HORACE: He's been waiting for you a real long time, man.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HORACE: I'm Horace.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HORACE: Godspeed, John.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Hugo.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY:  Mallomars.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Wake up, Hugo.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Hmm? Huh? What?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Time to get up. We're gonna get going.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: I thought we didn't know where we're going, dude.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: We do now.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Hmm.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: I used to have dreams.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 WOMAN OVER P.A.: Dr. Miller, Dr. Miller, please call the switchboard.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: Hi, Emily. Mrs. Locke, it's good to see you.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MRS. LOCKE: How is he?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: He's amazing. He's the youngest preemie to ever survive in this hospital. He's had infections, pneumonia, you name it. And every time, he knocked them out. He is a fighter, your little John.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MRS. LOCKE: That's wonderful.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: The other girls say he's a miracle baby, and today, we're gonna take him out of the incubator so you can hold him for the very first time.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 EMILY: I...  I can't do this. I...  I'm sorry I can't! 
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MRS. LOCKE: So who do I talk to about adoption?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: You can't smoke in here, Mrs. Locke.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MRS. LOCKE: Oh. Of course. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 NURSE: Is that the father?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MRS. LOCKE: I, uh... I don't know who that is.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Can I ask you somethin'?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Sure.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Why am I here, man?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: You're here because you can see the cabin, and that makes you special.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Well, I have a theory as to why we're the only ones who can see it.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: I'd love to hear it.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: I think we can see it 'cause we're the craziest. So how'd you figure out where it was, dude?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: I didn't. We're not going to the cabin. We're gonna make a pit stop first.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Pit stop? Where?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: You ever wonder what happened to the DHARMA Initiative, Hugo? There must have been at least a hundred of 'em living on this island—manning the stations, building those homes, making all that ranch dressing that you like. And then one day, they're all gone. They just disappeared. You want to know where we're going?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: We're going to see them.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Whoa. What happened to 'em?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE:  He did.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 WOMAN: Hello!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 CHILD: That game's stupid.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 WOMAN: He's right in here. Come on in.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 WOMAN: Melissa, stop that! Go on now. Take your brother in the kitchen. There's someone here who wants to see John.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RICHARD: It is coming down like cats and dogs out there.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 WOMAN: This nice gentleman wants to talk to you, John. So I want you on your best behavior. Understand? He's all yours.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RICHARD: You like backgammon? Yeah? You seem to have a pretty good sense of the game. I'm Richard, John. I run a school for kids who are... extremely special, and I have reason to believe that you might be one them. Mind if I show you a couple of really neat things?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RICHARD: Did you draw that, John?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RICHARD: I want you to look at these things... and think about 'em.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RICHARD: Okay, now tell me, John, which of these things belong to you?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JOHN: To—to keep?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RICHARD: No, no, John. Which of these things belong to you already?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RICHARD: Are you sure the knife belongs to you, John?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RICAHRD: You sure about that?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RICHARD: Well, it doesn't.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 WOMAN: How did he do?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RICHARD: I'm afraid John isn't quite ready for our school. I'm sorry I've wasted your time.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 WOMAN:  What did you do?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: What's he doing down there?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: So... This is where you shot Locke and left him for dead, huh?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: Yes, Hugo, I was standing right where you are now when I pulled the trigger. Should have realized at the time that it was pointless, but... I really wasn't thinking clearly.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Is that why you killed all these people, too?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: I didn't kill them.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Well, if the Others didn't wipe out the DHARMA Initiative—
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: They did wipe them out, Hugo, but it wasn't my decision.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Then whose was it?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: Their leader's.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: But I thought you were their leader.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: Not always.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: The cabin. He was building it.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Did you find what you were looking for?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Yes, Hugo. I believe I did.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: I need your key.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS: Captain. Mayhew just died. Doc couldn't do anything for him. The crew's asking a lot of questions about what happened to you guys over there.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: You tell the crew that I'm dealing with it, then you can go gas up the chopper, Frank. We're going back.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS: Going back? What the hell for?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Gas up the chopper, Frank.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: Listen, Martin. While you were gone, there was some sort of a sickness.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Mm-hm.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: The crew—they've been exhibiting some very strange behavior. Regina threw herself overboard, for God's sake. Now I would be derelict in my duty if I didn't point out that this might be exactly what's happening to you.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: I appreciate your concern. Give me your key.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: That's not the protocol—
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: The reason there are two keys is we're only supposed to open the safe together.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: You're here, aren't you?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: What is that?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: It's the secondary protocol.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: What does it say?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Says where Linus is going.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: How would Mr. Widmore know that?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: 'Cause he's a very smart man, and if Linus knows that we're gonna torch the Island, there's only one place that he can go.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: What do you mean, "torch the Island"? That was not the agreement. I agreed to ferry you here for an extraction mission.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Fix my gun.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 DESMOND: The injured man... there was no gunshot. What do you think happened to him?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 SAYID: I don't know. But when they get back, they'll be certain it doesn't happen again.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: Omar! Keamy wants you in the armory.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 OMAR: He said I wasn't supposed to let those two out of my sight.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: I'll watch them. Go.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: There's a pantry below our galley with enough room for two men. I've left you a supply of food and water. You need to go there.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 SAYID: Michael—is he dead?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: No, but not for lack of bloody trying, which is precisely why you two need to be hiding before Keamy comes back on this deck.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 SAYID: Hiding is pointless. Give us your Zodiac raft so we can start ferrying people back here from the beach. The only way to save our lives is to get our people off that Island.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: Meet me behind the container in ten minutes. The boat will be in the water.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: The cabin's here. We came from over there. Up the coast.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Here you go. Drink up, dude. Digging through dead bodies takes it out of you.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: It's gonna be dark soon, Hugo. If you head that way, you'll hit the coast, and all you have to do is take it north until you reach our beach.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Uh, what?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: I forced you to come with us at gunpoint, and I'm sorry, Hugo, but I was led to believe that we needed you to find this place.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Oh, I get it. Now you got your magic map, you don't—you don't need me anymore.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm offering you a chance to leave. I don't want to put you in harm's way against your will.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: And you think walking through the jungle at night by myself is gonna be any safer?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm not sure it is.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: I think I'll stick with you guys. This way?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: He actually thinks staying was his idea. Not bad, John. Not bad at all.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm not you.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: You're certainly not.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JOHN: Somebody, let me out! Please let me out. Please, somebody, let me—
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GELLERT: John, you okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JOHN: I'm fine. I'm fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GELLERT: Get to class, ladies. Tardy bell just rang. John, you're bleeding. Come on. Let's go to the nurse's office.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GELLERT: You wanna talk about it?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JOHN: No.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GELLERT: I know you're probably upset right now, but I do have some exciting news for you. I got a call from Portland recently. There's a company up there doing some very exciting things in chemistry and new technologies. They're called Mittelos Laboratories. I spoke with a Dr. Alpert. He's very interested in finding young, bright minds to enter into these new fields of science. They want you to go to their camp this summer.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JOHN: Science camp?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GELLERT: Yes.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JOHN: Don't you understand that things like science camp are the reason why I get stuffed into lockers?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GELLERT: John, this is a great opportunity.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JOHN: How do they even know about me?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GELLERT: Well, they must have sent a rep to the science fair—your display at Costa Mesa.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JOHN: I'm not a scientist! I like boxing and fishing and cars. I like sports!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GELLERT: I'm gonna tell you something—something I wish someone had told me at your age. You might not want to be that guy in the labs surrounded by test tubes and beakers, but that's who you are, John. You can't be the prom king. You can't be the quarterback. You can't be a superhero.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JOHN: Don't tell me what I can't do.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS:  Why didn't you tell me?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MICHAEL: Tell you what?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS: That you're a survivor of 815.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MICHAEL: Aa 'cause you wouldn't have believed me.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS: You didn't think I'd believe you? I tell you that I'm one of the only people in the world that think that that plane on the bottom of the ocean is a hoax, and you didn't think I'd believe you?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MICHAEL: I didn't know if I could trust you. Your boss put that plane there.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS:  Man, I thought I was Mr. Conspiracy, but you got me beat there.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MICHAEL:  Listen to me. Listen to me. You can't fly that guy back—Keamy.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS: You let me worry about Keamy, all right?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MICHAEL: You can't fly him back! He is gonna kill everyone on that Island. Everyone. And you don't want that on your conscience, man. Trust me.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS: Hey, boss. Just getting him down to the engine room.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: Stay on a heading of exactly 3-0-5. Faraday says that's the only safe way to and from the boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 SAYID: What will you tell Keamy if he notices the Zodiac is missing?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: I'll tell him you stole it. Now go.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 SAYID: Desmond.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 DESMOND: I can't go with you.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 SAYID: Why not?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 DESMOND: I've been on that island for three years. I'm never setting foot on it again ... not when Penny's coming for me.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 SAYID: I'll be back with the first group as soon as I can.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 DESMOND: Stay on that bearing, yeah?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 SAYID: I will.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: You need to go now.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Should be about 200 yards this way.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: You sure it's gonna be there, John?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: The cabin—what if it's moved again?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: It hasn't moved because I was told that this is where it would be.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: I was told a lot of things too—that I was chosen, that I was special. Ended up with a tumor on my spine and my daughter's blood all over my hands.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm sorry those things happened to you, Ben.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: Those things had to happen to me. That was my destiny. But you'll understand soon enough that there are consequences to being chosen... because, destiny, John, is a fickle bitch.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Guys? Cabin.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 PHYSICAL THERAPIST: Okay, okay, okay. Good job, man. Good job, John. Okay, we'll try it some more tomorrow.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 PHYSICAL THERAPIST: He's all yours. Come on up.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 ORDERLY: It's all right. Come on.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 ORDERLY: Don't give up, Mr. Locke.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 ORDERLY: I'm just saying, don't give up. Anything's possible.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE:  You should read my file. My spine was crushed. There's a 98% chance I'll never get any feeling back in my legs. So I don't know why I'm even trying to—
Lost.Season04.Episode11 ORDERLY: As a matter of fact, I did read your file. You survived falling eight stories out of a building. That's a miracle, Mr. Locke.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 ABADDON: Let me ask you something. Do you believe in miracles?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: No. I don't believe in miracles.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 ABADDON: You should. I had one happen to me.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Hey, look. I just want to go back to my room.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 ABADDON: You know what you need, Mr. Locke? You need to go on a walkabout.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Wha—what's a walkabout?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 ABADDON: It's a journey of self-discovery. You go out into the Australian Outback with nothing more than a knife and your wits.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: I can't "walkabout" anything. In case you haven't noticed, I'm a cripple.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 ABADDON: Is that what you are, Mr. Locke? I went on my walkabout convinced I was one thing, but I came back another. I found out what I was made of, who I was.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: And here you are, an orderly.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 ABADDON: Oh, I'm a lot more than just an orderly, John.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 ABADDON: When you're ready, Mr. Locke...  you'll listen to what I'm saying. And then when you and me run into each other again... you'll owe me one.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 OMAR: Hey, doc. Wanna hear something weird?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RAY: Ah, sure.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 OMAR: You know that morse code message that I got from the beach? It said that the doctor washed up on the shore with his throat slit.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 RAY: But I'm the doctor.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 OMAR: Crazy, right?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Everything here?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 OMAR: Yes sir.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Good. Get it packed up.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS: What are you gonna do with all that?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Fire her up, Frank.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS: Mr. Keamy, I was hired to fly scientists.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Get your ass in the cockpit and fire up the chopper, Frank.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS: I'm not taking you.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: I'll kill you, Frank.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS: Yeah, well, you do that, you'll never get back to the island 'cause I'm the only pilot you got.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Sorry, Doc.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: That change anything, Frank? Huh? Another 30 seconds goes by and someone else's turn—
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: I fixed your gun. Now stand down, Martin, or I will fire.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: I don't think you want to do that, Captain.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 GAULT: What's that on his arm? What's that on his arm?!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Hey! What'll it be, Frank?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LAPIDUS: We're flying.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Come on. Let's go, boys. Come on! Get the rest of the weapons onboard, and let's go. Let's go! Let's get out of here. Let's move out.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 KEAMY: Thanks, Captain. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JULIET: Hey! What did I say to you?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JACK:  You told me not to leave my tent. I was hungry.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JULIET: Jack, you have to rest. You can't run around. I know that it is hard for you to ask for help, but if you tear your stitches...
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JACK: Okay. Okay. I got it.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JULIET: Doctors make the worst patients.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JULIET: Jack!
Lost.Season04.Episode11 JACK: I think they want us to follow 'em.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: All right. Let's do this.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: I'm not going in there with you.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: The island wanted me to get sick and it wanted you to get well. My time is over, John. It's yours now.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 HURLEY: Yeah, I'm cool with you going in alone too.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: Good luck, John.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Are you Jacob?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MAN: No. But I can speak on his behalf.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Well, who are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 MAN: I'm Christian.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: You know why I'm here?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: Yeah, sure. Do you?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm here... because I was chosen to be.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: That's absolutely right.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Claire?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 CLAIRE: Hi John.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: What're you doing here?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 CLAIRE: Don't worry. I'm fine. I'm with him.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Wh—where's the baby?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: The baby's where he's supposed to be, and that's not here. It's probably best that you don't tell anyone that you saw her.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: Why? Why is she—
Lost.Season04.Episode11 CHRISTIAN: We don't have time for this. The people from the boat are already on their way back, and once they get here, all of these questions won't matter one bit. So why don't you ask the one question that does matter?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: How do I save the island?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: Did he tell you what we're supposed to do?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: He did.
Lost.Season04.Episode11 BEN: Well?
Lost.Season04.Episode11 LOCKE: He wants us to move the island.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 PILOT: We got a little chop ahead.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 PILOT: Put that away, man. You're freaking me out.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 COPILOT: We need this thing. With the cargo we got back there? Bad mojo.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 PILOT: Ms. Decker?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MS. DECKER: Yes?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 PILOT: Wanna head back there and let 'em know we're landing?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MS. DECKER: Sure. Of course.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MS. DECKER: We're coming in for a landing.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MS. DECKER: It's a military facility just west of Honolulu. It's completely private. Your—your families are already here. Now there's a lot of press that wanna speak to you, but as far as Oceanic is concerned, you don't have to speak to any reporters.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK:  We'll talk to 'em.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MS. DECKER: Is that all right with all of you?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: It's fine. We all agreed. We just—we just wanna get it over with.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MS. DECKER: Okay. Um, they're referring to you as the "Oceanic Six". That's not the best branding as far as we're concerned, but it's catchy. We'll see you on the ground.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: We all know the story. If we get any questions that we don't wanna answer, or that we can't answer, let's just keep our mouths shut. It's okay. They'll—they'll think that we're in shock.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: We are in shock, Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Well... then this should be easy.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 ROSE: It was Sayid and—and Desmond in the helicopter, right? I mean, it had to be. Why else would they have dropped that thingamabob right over us?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: Then why wouldn't they just land?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: I don't know, but this thing is trackin' the chopper. So if they were on it, they want us to know where they're going.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: It's a phone, right? Can't we just call?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Well?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Don't try anything stupid.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FARADAY: Understood.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KEAMY:  Put it down over there.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JULIET: Is that from the chopper?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FARADAY: Sh shh.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FRANK:  We're still 5 klicks from the site.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KEAMY:  I said put it down, Frank. Okay, gear up, boys. Soon as we hit the ground, we deploy to the Orchid. Heads down! Let's do this.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: You know what "the Orchid" is?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JULIET: No. I didn't hear Desmond or Sayid either.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Kate.  Wanna take a walk?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Absolutely.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: I'll get the guns. You get some water, okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JULIET: You can't possibly be serious. You just had surgery, Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: I'm gonna be fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JULIET: If your sutures rip, you're not gonna be fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: I can't just sit around waiting.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JULIET: Recovery is not "sitting around"!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Look, I have to do this.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JULIET: Why?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Because I promised those people that I would get 'em off this island. 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JULIET: Don't bleed to death, Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: I'll see ya in a couple hours.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 CHARLOTTE: Daniel? What's wrong?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FARADAY:  Charlotte, did you hear what he said? They're going to the Orchid. They're using the secondary protocol.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 CHARLOTTE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FARADAY: We have to get off this island. Right now.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: We're catchin' up. The chopper must've landed.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Why don't you take a break?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: You're bleeding.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: No, I'm not bleeding. I'm... I'm suppurating. It's... discharge. My body's just fightin' the infection around the stitches.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: You know when most people are lying and they can't look you in the eye? You do the exact opposite.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MILES: Hey, long time no see.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: Hey, who are you talkin' to up there, Genghis?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Where's Claire?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: We lost her.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: You what??
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: She just walked off in the middle of the night. We looked for her for a day, but she was just gone. I was hopin' maybe she went back to the beach.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: She didn't.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: Well, what are y'all doin' out here? What's that phone for?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: The chopper flew over the beach. Someone tossed this out. It must've been Sayid.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: Well, you better hope it ain't Sayid, 'cause if he's with those animals that just blew up half of New Otherton, you do not wanna tussle with 'em.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: What, they tried to kill you?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: Just like Locke said they would.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: So... what? We're supposed to just... turn around and hide? 'Cause it seems like that didn't work so well for you.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: I'm sorry, Doc, maybe this is déjà vu, but didn't you just do the whole "run through the jungle with a walkie" plan?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: That helicopter is our only way off this island.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: What's with you and "gettin' off the island"? You're like a damn broken record.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Stop it! Are you two fightin' each other now?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Look. I put Sayid and Desmond on that chopper. It was my call. It's my responsibility. I'm going after it whether they're on it or not. You can all head back to the beach.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Jack... no, no, no. You can't go by yourself.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Take care of the baby. Okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: That son of a bitch is stubborn.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: Hold up! You don't get to die alone.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MS. DECKER: Based on the location of the wreckage, our best estimate of the crash site is...  here. From there, the survivors were carried by the ocean's current to...  here—an uninhabited island in the Lesser Sunda Islands known as Membata. As you've all read in your briefing books, on day 103...  a typhoon washed up the remnants of an Indonesian fishing boat, including basic supplies and a survival raft. On day 108, the remaining six survivors, including Ms. Austen's baby which she gave birth to on the island of Membata, used this raft to journey here—  an island called Sumba. They then came ashore near a village called Manukangga. This photo was taken by the local fisherman who found them. Once it was discovered who they were, they were transported to Honolulu by the U.S. Coast Guard. As you can imagine, this has been an extraordinarily trying experience. They have, however, agreed to answer a few questions. So, ladies and gentlemen, the survivors of Oceanic 8-1-5.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MS. DECKER: Yes.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MALE REPORTER #1: Dr. Shephard! Dr. Shephard! Can you tell us what it was like when the plane hit the ocean? Uh, how you survived.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Um...
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: It—it all happened really fast. I remember the impact. I remember the—the plane filling up with water. A group of us got to the emergency door, and, um... got out before it went down.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MALE REPORTER #1: And those of you who survived—you swam to the island?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: No. We had, uh, cushions. We had some life jackets. We were in the water for over a day before the current took us in. By then, there was only eight of us left.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MALE REPORTER #1: What happened to the other three?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: One of them, his name is Boone Carlyle, suffered tremendous internal injuries and died a few days after the crash. A woman, Libby, she didn't make it through the first week. Charlie Pace, he drowned a few weeks before we were able to leave.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FEMALE REPORTER #1: Over here! Over here, please! Considering the ordeal that you've all been through, you look pretty healthy having been on an island for more than a hundred days.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Was that directed at me, Dude?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FEMALE REPORTER #1: Well, actually, Mr. Reyes, you were worth more than $150 million at the time of your... death. How does it feel to know you're going to get all that money back?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: I don't want it back, any of it. That money was bad luck.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FEMALE KOREAN REPORTER: 권선화 씨, 섬에서 사망한 사람 중 한 명이 당신의 남편이 맞습니까?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FEMALE REPORTER #2: What did she say?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MALE REPORTER #3: Can somebody translate that?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: She asked if my husband was one of the people who died on the island.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: The answer is no. He never made it off the plane.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 ARABIC REPORTER: Are you aware of the situation in Iraq, Mr. Jarrah? Do you have any plans to return?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: There is nothing for me in Iraq.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 ARABIC REPORTER: Mr Shephard, now that you are home, what are your plans?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: I haven't really thought too much about it, uh—my father died in Sydney, I was bringing him home for the funeral when the plane crashed. Even though the body is...—I'd like to put him to rest.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MALE REPORTER #4: Ms. Austen...
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MALE REPORTER #4: What was it like giving birth on the island?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Scary.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MALE REPORTER #4: Your son—uh, Aaron? How old is he now?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: He's just a little over 5 weeks.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MALE REPORTER #4: So that would've made you about six months pregnant when the U.S. Marshal service apprehended you in Australia for an outstanding murder warrant. Is that correct?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MS. DECKER: Uh, I'm afraid Ms. Austen's legal issue is off the table. Next question.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FEMALE REPORTER #1: Mr. Jarrah, given the amazing circumstances surrounding the survival of you six, is it possible there are any other survivors from the crash yet to be discovered?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: No. Absolutely not.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK:  You did good.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MS. DECKER: Mr. Jarrah? There's a woman outside. She says she knows you, but she wasn't on the list of family members. Her name is a Noor Abed Jaseem.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: Nadia? Nadia.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: Hey! Over here!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: Sayid! Where's Desmond?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: He's fine. He's on the freighter. Listen, I'm going to start taking people back—six at a time. We have to go right now before the helicopter gets back to the boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JULIET: Why do we have to go to the boat before the chopper gets back?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: Because the men on that helicopter have every intention of killing us all.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JULIET: Jack and Kate just went running after it.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: So when is someone gonna tell me where we're going?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: We're going to a place called the Orchid, Hugo.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: And what's that?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: It's a greenhouse.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: And why are we going to a greenhouse exactly?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: You heard John. We're going to move the island.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Right. And how are we gonna do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: Very carefully.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Well, if you could move the island whenever you wanted, why didn't you just move it before the psychos with guns got here?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: Because doing it is both dangerous and unpredictable. It's a measure of last resort.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Awesome.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: Allow me.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: May I have that mirror, please?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN:  You know, those are 15 years old.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: What are you doing, Dude?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: Communicating.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: Communicating with who?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: Who do you think?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: All right. Now we can go.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: Wait. What was that? What did you tell them?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: None of your business, John.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FARADAY: Hey, Sayid, listen. If you wanna run off into the jungle after the chopper, you should do that. But in the meantime, we need to get these people off this island.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: I won't be long. If I can catch up with Jack and Kate—
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FARADAY: I can start ferrying people now. I can get them there safely. By the time you get back, I can have most of these people on our boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: I trust you know the bearing. You'd better get going.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FARADAY: Thank you.  All right, first group in the raft. We can fit six.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JULIET: Okay, okay, hold on. Sun is pregnant. You should go first.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Sayid? What are you doing here? Jack thought that you—
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: I know what he thought. That's why I'm going after him. How far ahead is he?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: I don't know. He's—he's with Sawyer. I left them about an hour ago. Jack's got a sat phone, and they're headed for the helicopter. I can track them. Look, you are not gonna catch up to them unless I go with you.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: Let's go.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Okay. Sun.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: Where's Claire?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Get Aaron on the boat, okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: It's all right. Just... I'll see you there.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE:  Just keep him safe!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: Shh.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FARADAY: All right, this is just the first trip. Here we go.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MAN: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 WOMAN: You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FARADAY: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 WOMAN: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JIN: 이 섬을 벗어나게 해 준다고 내가 약속했지. 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MR. PAIK: 어떻게 된 거야? 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 UNDERLING: 누가 했는지 모르겠지만요, 다른 은행을 다섯 군데나 썼습니다. 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MR. PAIK: 당장 가서 윤을 데리고 와! 어서! 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: 아버지, 제가 방해한 건 아니죠? 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MR. PAIK: 아니다. 항상 사업 상 하는 일인데 뭘. 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: 무슨 일이라도 있으세요? 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MR. PAIK: 내가 말해 줘도 넌 이해하기 힘든 복잡한 회사 일이야. 그래, 몸은 좀 어떠냐? 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: 아버지가 진수 씨를 얼마나 싫어했는지 다 알고 있는데... 새삼스럽게 아이에게 관심있는 척 하지 마세요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MR. PAIK: 너 지금 뭐라고 했냐? 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: 제 뜻 아시잖아요. 진수 씨를 증오하셨잖아요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MR. PAIK: 너 지금 누구한테 함부로! 난 니 아버지야! 버르장머리라고는 하나도 없이! 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: 오세아닉 항공사로부터 상당한 금액의 합의금을 받았어요. 그 돈으로 오늘 아침에 아버지 회사 지분 반을 구입했고요. 이제부터는 저를 동업자로 존중해 주셔야겠죠. 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MR. PAIK: 뭐? 너... 뭐 때문에? 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: 제 남편 인생도 망가뜨리고, 그런 아버지 때문에 우리가 그 비행기를 탄거라고요. 그러니까 전 아버지 하고 또 다른 사람이 진수 씨 죽음에 책임 있다고 생각해요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: 우선 이 아이를 낳고 나서 이 회사 미래는 그때 가서 얘기하죠. 우리 회사에 대해서. 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Mom? Dad?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Mr. Tranh? Lady Tranh?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Why am I doing this? Why am I doing this? Why am I doing this?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 ALL: Surprise! Happy birthday!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 CARMEN: Happy birthday!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DAVID: Happy birthday, Hugo!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 CARMEN: Hugo, what are you doing with that?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: I don't know. I thought there might be a prowler or something.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 CARMEN: Jesus Christ is not a weapon. Okay. Enjoy your party.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MAN: Wwhoo! Happy birthday!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: No way.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Happy birthday, Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Hey, Kate.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Hey, little buddy.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Say hi. Jack's running late. Sorry.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 NADIA: Happy birthday, Hugo.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Wow, you guys are here.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: Interesting choice of theme.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Yeah, my mom... really doesn't get it, Dude.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DAVID: Hey! How's everybody doing?  What are you talking about? Building a fire or huntin' boars?  I guess not. Uh, listen. Uh, do you mind, uh, excusing us for a little while? I-I wanna show you your birthday present. Hmm? Come on. Bye-bye now.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: I told you I don't want anything.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DAVID: Hugo, it's your birthday. You gotta get somethin'.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Not with the money. I don't want anything from the money.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DAVID: Relax. I got this before you gave us the money. Ta-da! Check it out.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: You fixed it.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DAVID: Yeah. After the crash, I—I worked on it as a memorial to you. When I was fixing it up, it was almost like I was with ya. But now you're back, and it's all yours. Wanna take her for a little spin?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DAVID: Is somethin' wrong, son?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Is this some kind of joke?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DAVID: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Did you do this?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DAVID: Do what?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Those are the numbers! Right there! The numbers I won the lottery with!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DAVID: Wow. What—what a coincidence.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: No. No, not a coincidence. I don't want this. I don't want any of it!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DAVID: Hugo? Wait—wait a minute. Hugo, what are you... son! Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DAVID: Hugo! Hugo! Hugo, where you goin'? Come on! Hugo!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Okay, let's say this greenhouse place does what you say, and, yeah, I get it. It's really dangerous and unpredictable. But suppose somehow it works, and we move the island. Doesn't that mean the dudes with guns move, too?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: Yes, I suppose they would.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Well, isn't that, you know, a problem?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: I'm working on it.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Well, what about me? I still wanna get off it!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: I'm afraid it's a little late for that, Hugo.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: May I have the binoculars, please? You might wanna get down lower to the ground.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: And why might we wanna do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: Because we're at the Orchid.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: What are we waitin' for?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: We're waiting, John, because Charles Widmore, the man who's trying to capture me and kill all the rest of you, knows about this place and knows that what we need is inside.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE:  I thought you said you had no idea why he was trying to find he island.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: I wasn't being entirely truthful.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: Yeah. When are you ever entirely truthful?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: You need to see this.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: What am I looking for?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: Look over there on the left-hand side. Watch the plants at the back.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: I don't see any—
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: They're already here.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FARADAY: Hey, hey! Hey, we're back!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DESMOND: Where's Sayid?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FARADAY: He had to go after Jack. You go. They're headed for the chopper.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DESMOND: You okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 FARADAY: I'm gonna head back for the next group.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MICHAEL:  Engine's fixed. Tell Hendricks to try it.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DESMOND: Okay, engine should be working.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HENDRICKS:  Indeed they are.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DESMOND: All right, well, take us to the island.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DESMOND: But make sure you—you stay on the bearing of 3-0-5. It's gotta be exactly 3-0-5. 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HENDRICKS: We've got some kind of RF interference with the the fathometer. I can't see the reef, mate.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DESMOND: RF interference? How is that possible? The radio room's down.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HENDRICKS: I don't know, but something on this boat is broadcasting. If we don't turn it off, I'm not going any closer than 5 miles off the coast.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DESMOND: Then I'll find it.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: Cut yourself shavin'?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Juliet took out my appendix a couple of days ago.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: You kiddin' me.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Nope.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: Well, what else did I miss?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: We're here.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LAPIDUS: Ah!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Lapidus!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LAPIDUS: Yeah! 
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: You know this yahoo?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LAPIDUS: "Yahoo"? This yahoo dropped that phone on you guys so you could find me—
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LAPIDUS: —and I could fly you outta here. So why don't you do me a favor and get in that back compartment? There's a toolbox. See if you can find something to get me outta these things.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: You heard the man.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: Well, all right. Can I get you boys a nice, cold glass of lemonade while I'm back there?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Where are Desmond and Sayid?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LAPIDUS: Your buddies were smart enough to keep their asses on the boat because right now that's the safest place to be. Because when the boys that I brought over here come stompin' out of this jungle, you're gonna wanna be long gone.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Where'd they go?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LAPIDUS: They're up by some greenhouse, perched up there, waitin' to snatch Linus.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Soon as we cut you free, you'll be able fly us out of here?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LAPIDUS: Hell, yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: Hang on, Shaggy. You said the hit squad's gonna grab Ben Linus?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LAPIDUS: Well, I don't see what's gonna stop 'em.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER: What are they gonna do with the people that are with him?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LAPIDUS: Nothin' good.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAWYER:  Hugo's with Ben.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK:  Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: About ten months ago, I wrote what I wanted to say at my father's funeral on the back of a cocktail napkin at the Sydney airport. I don't remember what I wrote, but whatever it was... he would've hated it.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: My father couldn't stand eulogies. "The only good thing about a wake is the free booze", he'd say.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Not much of a wake because I won't even be able to bury him. So... What I wanna say is not for my father. It's for me. Good-bye, dad. I loved you. I miss you.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Thanks very much for coming.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MARGO: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MARGO: Thank you for coming.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Thanks.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MARGO: I'll see you back at the house?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MARGO: I love you, sweetheart.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: I love you, Mom.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MARGO:  I'm so glad you're home.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK:  I'll see you soon.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MARGO: Okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: You did that well.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Had a lot of practice.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 CAROLE:  Excuse me. May I have a word with you?  Mr. Shephard... I'm very sorry for your loss.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: Thank you. How did you know my father?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 CAROLE: I believe I'm the reason he was in Australia when he died.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: I'm sorry. I don't understand. Why would he have come to see you?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 CAROLE: Oh, he... he didn't come to see me. I was still in the hospital. I never saw him. He came to see his daughter. My daughter, Mr. Shephard.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JACK: My father didn't have a daughter—
Lost.Season04.Episode12 CAROLE: Yes. He did. If you don't believe me, check his phone records. Would you like to know the—the strangest thing about all this, Mr. Shephard? My daughter was on your plane, too. She was on flight 8-1-5.  You were in the air for six hours, probably just a few rows from her and you never even knew she was your sister.  she was one of the ones who died when your plane hit the water.  Her name was... Claire.  I didn't mean to burden you with this, but... you needed to know. I'm... sorry for your loss.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 CAROLE: Your son is beautiful.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: I don't understand. How'd you get back to New York?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MICHAEL: Uh, Walt and I, uh, uh... we took Ben's boat and we followed his bearing. A couple of days, we came to an island, you know, with people. I sold the boat... we hopped a cargo ferry back to the States. Didn't tell anybody who we were.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SUN: And now you're working for Ben?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MICHAEL: I do not work for Ben. I'm trying to make up for what I did. I'm trying to help you out here. Translate what I said.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JIN:  I understand.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 DESMOND: Hey! Michael! I need you now!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 MICHAEL: Oh, my God.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 JIN: 아기 데리고 위에 가서 기다려. Now.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: What's the matter?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE:  These aren't Jack or Sawyer. They're different tracks, fresh... and they're doubling back behind us.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: Whoever you are, come out now!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 RICHARD: All right. All right, let's just relax. All right, let's—let's just rel—let's relax.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: Stop! Stop!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 RICHARD: Just relax. Put the guns down. Pl—
Lost.Season04.Episode12 KATE: I said stop right there!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 RICHARD: Please just drop your guns.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 SAYID: Take one more step—
Lost.Season04.Episode12 RICHARD: I said drop your guns.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: I see two of them, but not the one who killed Alex.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: He's there. Hold on to that for me, will you?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: Listen to me very carefully, John, because I'm not gonna have time to repeat this. You're gonna go into that greenhouse through that hole there. Once inside, you're gonna turn left. Go about 20 paces until you see a patch of anthuriums on your left. They're in an alcove against the north wall. Face the wall, reach down with your left hand. You'll find a switch that activates the elevator. The elevator takes you down to the actual Orchid station.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 HURLEY: Whoa. Wait. What?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: Okay, I'm sorry, Ben, but maybe I missed the part where you explained what I'm supposed to do about the armed men inside.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: I'm gonna take care of them.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE: And how the hell are you gonna do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: How many times do I have to tell you, John? I always have a plan.
Lost.Season04.Episode12 LOCKE:  Ben!  Ben!
Lost.Season04.Episode12 BEN: My name is Benjamin Linus. I believe you're looking for me.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: "We have to go back"? "We have to go back"?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Now hold on—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Who do you think you are?! You call me over and over again for two days straight, stoned on your pills! And then you show up here with an obituary for Jeremy Bentham.  When he came to me and I heard what he had to say, I knew he was crazy. But you... You believed him.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Him, of all people.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Yes, Kate, I did, because he said that that was the only way that I could keep you safe—you and Aaron.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Don't you say his name. I still have to explain to him why you are not there to read to him, so don't you say his name!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: I've spent the last three years trying to forget all the horrible things that happened on the day that we left. How dare you ask me to go back?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: You sure we're going the right way?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Lapidus said they were headed northeast.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: You might wanna slow down a little, 'cause you look like you're about to keel over, Doc.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: I'm fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Of course you're fine. You're always fine—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Is this it?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: So what's the plan, Sundance?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: The plan is we wait til—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Hugo?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Sawyer!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: You all right?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude, you came back. How'd you know where I was?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: It's good to see you, Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY:  Yeah. Yeah, man. You, too.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: So where the hell is he?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Locke!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Hello, Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: There's enough C-4 here to blow up a bloody aircraft carrier. When I was in the army... I did six months' explosive ordnance disposal, which, as the saying goes, is just enough time to learn how to blow yourself up.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: Is it on a timer? And why hasn't it gone off yet?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: This is a—a radio receiver. It's... it's like a walkie-talkie. You send it a signal, and, uh... it—it triggers a bomb remotely.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JIN: So can we... turn off?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND:  This is a... this is a trip wire. Move it, and... boom. This is dummy wiring. If you cut the wrong one... boom. This is multiple firing systems. You disable one, and the next one... boom. Uh, this... battery's the power source. If you disconnect it—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JIN: Boom.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: What are you doing in here?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: There's a—a DHARMA station below us, and, um, I'm looking for a way to get in.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Get in and do what?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Hugo, James, would you mind if I spoke to Jack alone?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Don't bother. We just came back for Hurley. Let's go.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Jack, you need to hear what I have to say—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: What I need to do is to walk back to the chopper, get on it, and get the rest of our people off this island.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Uh, dude, probably not the best idea right now. Those Rambo guys are taking Ben to that helicopter. He surrendered himself to 'em about an hour ago.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK:  Now why the hell would he do that?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: So tell me something, Ben. What is it that makes you so important, hmm? I'm curious. I'm curious as to why Mr. Widmore would pay me so much money just to come out here and capture you and bring you back alive.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Charles Widmore tell you to kill my daughter?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Hey! How'd he get the toolbox?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Damn.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Who gave you the toolbox, Frank?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Who, uh...
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY:  Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're good right there.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Who are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE:  I'm Kate. I'm one of the passengers of Flight 815.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Why are you running?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: I'm being chased...  by his people.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Kocol... Lacour... Redfern on flank.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Come here.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Whoa. Hey.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Get on your knees.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Uhh!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Hands above your heads, both of you.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Now! Spray it!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Ben, stay close. Run! Run.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Grenade!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Uhh!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Get up. Come on. Get up.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Uhh! Aah!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Aah!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Aah! 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Thank you for coming, Richard.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 RICHARD: My pleasure.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Could you cut me free, Kate?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: What was the arrangement?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 RICHARD: They, uh, help us free you, and we let 'em off the island.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Fair enough. The helicopter is yours. You and Sayid have a safe journey back.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: So we can go? Off the island? That's it?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: That's it.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL'S MOTHER: Thank you, miss.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 NURSE: Mm-hmm.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL'S MOTHER: Are you Hurley?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL'S MOTHER: Are you dangerous?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: I'm sorry. Do I know you?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL'S MOTHER: No, you don't know me... but you know my grandson.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL'S MOTHER: Now we've traveled all the way across country just so he could see you. I need to know if you're gonna do anything crazy.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: I won't do anything crazy.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Hey, Walt.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 WALT: Hey, Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: You're getting big, Dude.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 WALT: You know, when you came back, I was waiting for one of you to come see me, but... nobody did.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 WALT: Do you know who did come see me? Jeremy Bentham. I don't understand why you're all lying.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY:  We're lying... because it's the only way to protect everyone that didn't come back.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 WALT: Like my dad?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Like your dad, yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: What the hell they talkin' about in there, anyway?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: I don't know. Leader stuff?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Where'd you get that?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Came from a box Ben dug up out of the ground. They're good.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Thanks for coming back for me.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER:  Ah, you got it.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Claire and the baby okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: What did you wanna talk to me about, John?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: I want you to reconsider leaving the island, Jack. I would like you to stay.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: You'd like me to stay?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Yeah, that's right.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK:  You threw a knife into the back of an unarmed woman. You led half of our people across the island and got most of them killed.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Well, Jack, you put a gun to my head and you pulled the trigger. I was hoping we could let bygones be bygones.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Well, I'll tell you what. You stay here in your little greenhouse, but the rest of us are going home.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: But you're not supposed to go home.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: And what am I supposed to do? Oh, I think I remember. What was it that you said on the way out to the hatch—that crashing here was our destiny?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: You know, Jack. You know that you're here for a reason. You know it. And if you leave this place, that knowledge is gonna eat you alive from the inside out...until you decide to come back.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Good-bye, John.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: You're gonna have to lie.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Excuse me?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: If you have to go, then you have to lie about everything...everything that happened since we got to the island it's the only way to protect it.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK:  It's an island, John. No one needs to protect it.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: It's not an island. It's a place where miracles happen. And—and—if you—if you don't believe that, Jack, if you can't believe that, just wait till you see what I'm about to do.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: There's no such thing as miracles.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Well... we'll just have to see which one of us is right.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Am I interrupting?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Nice to see you, too, Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Couldn't find the Anthuriums, could you?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: I don't know what they look like.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: What are you doing?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Didn't you tell him?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: I tried.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Sayid and Kate are waiting for you at the helicopter. I understand that your people from the beach are being brought to the freighter even as we speak.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: I'd love to fill you in on everything you missed, Jack, but you, Hugo, James, you need to get moving. If I were you, I'd want to be on that boat within the hour. Good-bye, Jack.  Let's go.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Lie to them, Jack. If you do it half as well as you lie to yourself, they'll believe you.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MAN: Yeah, I'll be right here.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: Michael? What's going on down there?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MAN: Ready to go?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: Did you tell anybody?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: No, Michael. I—I didn't. Can you... t-turn it off?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: It isn't even on yet. But, yeah, if what's in this tank does what it's supposed to do, we're gonna be okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: Look, I'll send Jin upstairs. There's no need for him to be down there with me when he can be up here with you.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: I'm pregnant.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: Congratulations, Sun.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: You're gonna what?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: Freeze it. This is liquid nitrogen. We use it in the refrigeration hold. The bomb needs a charge from the battery to detonate, right? And the battery runs on a—a chemical reaction. I spray the battery. I can keep it cold. No reaction.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: And what's the catch?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: The catch is we only have one canister. We use it up, we're right back where we started.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: Well, shouldn't we save it till the light turns red?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: If we see that light turn red and the battery's not already cold, that is the last thing we will ever see. Either way, at least we'll have a warning, buy ourselves some time.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: All right, um, freeze the battery. Jin, help me trace back these wires, make a list of where each of them goes to.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MAN: Boat!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MAN: Down there.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JULIET: Did you get them all to the boat?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Yeah, everybody's safe.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JULIET: Are they coming closer?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: They fixed the engine, and they're gonna get as close to the island as they can without hitting the reef, so the next trip shouldn't take so long. I'm just gonna get some water, and I'll come back in a minute.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JULIET: Okay, I'll get the next group ready to go.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JULIET: Dan!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Yeah?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JULIET: Thanks for helping us.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Absolutely.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JULIET: Okay, let's go!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 ROSE: Uh, who told you you could eat those peanuts?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MILES: May—may I eat these peanuts?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 ROSE: I'm gonna keep my eye on you, shorty.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY:  Miles...
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MILES: Somethin' wrong with your neck?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Follow me, please.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 CHARLOTTE: Dan, you're back. Hey. What's wrong?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: I'm leaving in ten minutes to take the next group of people to the freighter. You need to make sure that you're with me on that raft, all right?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MILES: Well, don't worry about me, 'cause I'm gonna stay.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Miles, no, uh, uh, I don't think I'm getting across the... direness of the circumstance.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MILES: Oh, no, you're very dire, but I'm still gonna stay.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Hey, ten minutes.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 CHARLOTTE: Yep.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MILES: I'm surprised you wanna leave.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 CHARLOTTE: Sorry?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MILES: It's just weird. You know, after all that time you spent trying to get back here.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 CHARLOTTE: What do you mean, get back here?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MILES: ...What do I mean?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: How deep is the station?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Deep.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Is this the magic box?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: No, John, it's not.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: What is all this stuff for?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Same things that all the DHARMA stations are for —silly experiments.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: What kind of experiments?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: You know what, John?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Why don't you watch this very informative video that will answer some of your questions...
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: ...and I'll take care of some business.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SCIENTIST:  Hello. I'm Dr. Edgar Halliwax...  and this is the orientation film for station six of the DHARMA Initiative. As you've no doubt surmised, station six, or "The Orchid," is not...  a botanical research unit. The unique properties...  of this island have created a kind of Casimir effect, allowing the DHARMA initiative to conduct unique experiments in both space and time.  This... is "the vault", constructed adjacent to a pocket of what we believe...  to be negatively charged "exotic matter". Great care must be taken to avoid leaving inorganic materials...  inside the chamber. The electromagnetic energy within the island can be highly volatile and unpredictable. Now, for your own safety and the safety of those around you, metallic objects must never...  be placed within the vault.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SCIENTIST:   In our first demonstration, we will attempt to shift the test subject 100 milliseconds ahead in four-dimensional space. For the briefest...  of moments, the animal will seem to disappear, but in reality... 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Hey. Uh... was he talking about what I think he was talking about?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: If you mean time-travelling bunnies, then yes.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: You do know that he said specifically not to put anything metal in here.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: You expecting someone?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: May I have my weapon back?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Sayid! Kate!  Good to see you, Dude.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: He say somethin' to tick you off, Freckles?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Didn't kill that one.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Well, which one did you kill?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Where's the baby?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: He's with Sun, and they should be at the freighter by now. Are you okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: I am now.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER:  Hey Kenny Rogers. What you trying to do there, pick a lock?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: You got a better idea?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Hacksaw.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: For the handcuffs, right?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Okay, take it easy.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Ay. All right, all right.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Sayid, how'd you get back?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: I took the Zodiac from the freighter.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Is it safe? A body from the boat washed up on the beach.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: It's safe now.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: All right! Let's get the hell outta here!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Let's go, Freckles. I've seen enough of this rock.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: After we drop everyone off at the boat, we can come back and look for Claire, right?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Absolutely.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Hands and feet inside the vehicle! Let's go for a ride!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SCIENTIST:  ...properties of this island have created a kind of Casimir effect...
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: I know you're down here, Ben.  Crouching in the dark, just waiting to take a shot at me.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SCIENTIST:  This... is "the vault"...
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Well, you better aim for the head, Ben! Not like your boyfriend who shot me in the back like a coward!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SCIENTIST:  ...to avoid leaving inorganic materials inside...
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: This body armor's, um, been known to take a bullet or two in its time.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: But before you take your shot, Ben, let me tell you about this. 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: See that? I took out a bit of a—a life insurance policy, Ben. It's a heart rate monitor, and it's connected to a radio transmitter. W—we call it a "dead man's trigger", Ben. If my heart stops beating...  it sends a little signal to the 500 pounds of C-4 that I've got hardwired out there on the freighter that'd kill a lot of innocent people, Ben. If you think I'm bluffing, need I remind you of, uh... how your daughter looked as she bled out? Face-down in the grass? 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Who the hell are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: My name is John Locke, and I have no... conflict with you. And neither do the people on that boat. So... why don't you put your knife down? We can talk about this.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Well, John Locke... I've never really been one for talk.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: You killed my daughter.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY: Aah!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: You killed my daughter!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Ben! Ben! Ben, stop! No, no! Stop!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Ben, what did you do?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: You just killed everybody on that boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: So?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Hey, Charlotte! Listen, uh, I wanted to say before you get on the boat, please—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 CHARLOTTE: I'm gonna stay, Daniel... for now, anyway.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Charlotte... there is no "for now". If you don't come with me, "for now" could be forever.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 CHARLOTTE: Nothing's forever.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Why?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 CHARLOTTE: Would it make any sense if I told you I was still looking for where I was born?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: N—no.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 CHARLOTTE: Good-bye, Daniel.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Let me guess. You're not coming.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JULIET: I promised I wouldn't leave until I got everyone here safely off this island. Relax. I'll still be here when you get back.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 FARADAY: Right, right... when I get back. Okay. Everybody ready? Let's get started. Off we go.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: I think I might have something. Okay, so... so if... if I cut this wire, it... it should disconnect the firing mechanisms.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JIN: Stop! 여기 연결돼 있어. No good.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: Damn it! I—I just don't know enough. H—how do we even know your little freezing trick's doing anything?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: We'll know if that light turns red and we're still here.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: How much stuff do we have left?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: We got a quarter tank.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: What happens if we can't deactivate the bomb?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: We better get everybody the hell off this boat.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: What's the matter?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: We're losing fuel.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: What?!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: We're losing fuel! Look outside, tell me if you can see anything!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: We have a fuel leak! A bullet must have pierced the tank!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: We gotta find a place to set her down!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: No, don't land!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: What?!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: There's no fuel on the island! We've gotta get to the boat, or this chopper's useless!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: I'm telling ya, I don't see the boat!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Well, then keep looking!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: We gotta get every ounce of extra weight off this chopper now! Anything that's not bolted down, toss it out!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Now what? Is that enough? Can we make it?!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: I'd feel a hell of a lot better if we were a few hundred pounds lighter! Well, if we don't make it, we're still close enough to ditch it on the beach.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Hey! Do not go back to the island!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: We might not have a choice, Doc.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Hey... 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Why are you telling me this?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Just do it, Freckles.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Sawyer!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to bother you. But do you have the time, please?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 GUY IN CAR: Yeah. It's eight fif—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Sayid?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Hello, Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: I think visiting hours are over, Dude.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: This isn't a visit. I want you to come with me.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Come with you where?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Somewhere safe.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: And why would I go anywhere with you? I haven't seen you in, like, forever.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Because circumstances have changed.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: What circumstances?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Bentham's dead.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Two days ago.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: What happened?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: They said it was suicide.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: What do you mean, they "said" it was suicide? And why are you calling him "Bentham"? His name is—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Don't say it. We're being watched.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude, I've been having regular conversations with dead people. The last thing I need now is paranoia.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: I just killed a man who's been perched outside this facility for the last week. I'm finding paranoia keeps me alive.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: We're not going back, are we?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: No. Just somewhere safe.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Okay then. Hold on a sec.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Checkmate, Mr. Eko.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Where's the freighter?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: I don't know. I stayed on course. They must have it on the move again.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: How much fuel?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Four, five minutes worth, unless somebody else wants to jump.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK:  As soon as we get to the boat, we'll go back for him.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Hey! There it is! The boat! I see it! Behind us!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Ben, help me. If he dies, everybody on that boat dies.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: That's not my problem, John.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Hang on, man. Hang on!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KEAMY:  Wherever you go... Widmore...  he'll find you.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Not if I find him first.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE:  Hey. No. No.  Hey. Hey! Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: You two need to go now. Get everybody off the boat. We have maybe five minutes left in the tank. Go!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JIN: You go. Go. I stay.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: Oh, bloody hell. Don't land! You can't land! Don't land! Don't land! There's a bomb! There's a bomb! Get away! There's a bomb! You can't land! Go back!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Did he say "bomb"?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: Don't land!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: What are you doing?!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: I don't care what the hell he's screaming! I'm flying on fumes! I gotta put this bird down!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: No! Don't land!  No! No! Look, you don't understand! Jin and Michael are doing everything they can, but there's no time! You've gotta get off the boat now!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: How long till we can fly again?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Somebody patch the other hole where the bullet came out!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: Give it to me. I'll do it.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Here! Somebody pump some gas!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: I'll handle the fuel.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Get that life raft right there! Come on! Let's go!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Hey, Sun! Sun! Where you going? We gotta go.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: Jin's below with Michael. I can't—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: No, no, there's no time! There's no time. We have to go.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: I won't leave him!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Okay. You get the baby on the chopper. I'll get Jin. All right?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Just keep pumping till I get it started! That'll be enough to get us to the island.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: Jin, you gotta go. There's nothing more we can do, man.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JIN: No, I can find—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: Hey, come on. It's over. I'm almost out of this stuff. Listen, you are a father now. Get to your wife and get her home.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JIN: Thank you, Michael.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: You're welcome. Go.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Hey! Not yet!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Your buddy said we got five minutes as of three minutes ago. If you're going, this is it. Let's go!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Kate! Come on!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Jin's still inside! Jin's still inside. We can't leave him behind.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Come on. Listen, I'm not leaving without you. We gotta get out of here now.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Let's go!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: Give me a minute! No! Wait!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: Where's Jin?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JIN: 자기야! 자기야! 여기야! 여기야! 나 아직 여기 있어!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: It's Jin! No! Jin! Jin! Jin! We have to go back! Turn around!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: We can't do it!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: We have to! We need to go back!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 CHRISTIAN: You can go now, Michael.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MICHAEL: Who are you?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN:  Jin!  Aah!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN:  Jin!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: Go back lower! We have to go find Jin!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Sun, there's nobody down there!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: You can't see anything from here!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: We didn't get enough fuel! We can't go back!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: Go lower! I know he's there!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Sun, I'm—Sun, I'm so sorry. He's not—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: He's down there! I know he's down there!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: We gotta go!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: No! I'm not leaving him!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Can't get to him!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: No, we're not leaving him! We're not! Turn back around!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Sun! Sun! It's gone!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: He's gone.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Shh. Shh.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Lapidus! Fly us back to the island.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: You got it.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: No!  No! No!  No!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: 어, 엄마. 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MRS. PAIK: 얘, 누가 너하고 얘기하고 싶대! 지연아, 엄마하고 얘기 좀 해볼래?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JI YEON: 엄마, 엄마. 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: 우리 예쁜 딸! 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MRS. PAIK: 얘, 너 어디 있니? 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: 런던에 있어요. 일 마무리 하고 오늘 밤에 출발해요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MRS. PAIK: 그래, 그럼 여행 안전하게 잘 해. 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: 그럴게요, 엄마. 집에서 봐요. 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 WIDMORE: All right, guys. Thanks.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: Excuse me. Mr. Widmore?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 WIDMORE: Yes.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: I'm Sun Kwon... Mr. Paik's daughter. I'm the managing director of Paik Industries.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 WIDMORE: Yes, of course. How is your father?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: Excellent, thank you.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 WIDMORE: Quite the golfer. I believe I owe him dinner after our last game.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: Are you really going to pretend that you don't know who I am?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 WIDMORE: I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, Ms. Kwon.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: Yes, you do know, Mr. Widmore... just like you know we've been lying all this time about where we were and what happened to us there. You and I have common interests. When you're ready to discuss them...
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: Call me. As you know, we're not the only ones who left the island.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 WIDMORE: Ms. Kwon? Why would you want to help me?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: "Why" what?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Why did you kill him when you knew it would destroy the boat?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Well, John, I really wasn't thinking straight. Sometimes... good command decisions get compromised by bad emotional responses.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: I'm sure you're gonna do a much better job of separating the two than I ever did.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: I asked you a question!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: If I were you, I'd duck.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: I better change.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Nice day for a swim.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JULIET: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Decided to take a dip.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Whatcha celebratin'?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JULIET: I'm not celebrating.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAWYER: Is that our boat?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JULIET: It was.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: What's that for?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: I'm going somewhere cold.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Then where is mine?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: You don't need one because you're not going with me.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Yes, I am going with you.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: No, John, you're not.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Jacob told me what we had to do. You don't get to make all the decisions—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: He told you what to do, but he didn't tell you how because he wants me to suffer the consequences.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: What consequences?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Whoever moves the island can never come back. So I'd like you to get on the elevator, John, and go back up. Richard and my people will be waiting 2 miles east of the Orchid.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: Waiting for me?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Ready, willing and able to share what they know. And then they will follow your every word. Good-bye, John. I'm sorry I made your life so miserable.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LOCKE: What do I tell 'em to do?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: You'll find your way, John. You always do.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 RICHARD: Hello, John. Welcome home.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: I hope you're happy now, Jacob.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: Yeah, what is that?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Where's the island? Where's the island?! Where the hell's the island?!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: It's gone.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Where the hell am I gonna land this thing?!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: There's another smaller island close by they took us to!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: I got news for ya, Doc. There's nothing but water in every direction!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Doesn't matter now. That's it, people! We're out of fuel!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Get your life vests on! We're going in! Brace yourselves!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Desmond! The life raft!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Hold on!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Where's Jack?!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Kate! Where is he?!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Are you okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Hurley, carry the baby.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Sayid, are you all right?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Yes!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Jack!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Where's Desmond?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Get the baby.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: I got him.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Desmond?! Jack! Give me a hand!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SUN: Here you go.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Get him to the raft. Get him to the raft. Get him up in the raft. We've gotta get him in the raft.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Is he breathing? Oh, my God. Is he breathing?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Oh, my god.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Oh, come on, Desmond.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: One, two, three.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Yeah. Yeah.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Yeah, you're all right.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: You're all right, man. You're okay.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Desmond.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: That's it. You're all right. That's it.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK:  It's okay. It's okay. We're alive. 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Hello?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Hello? Who's there?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Don't move. Don't you touch my son!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE:  Claire? How did y—
Lost.Season04.Episode13 CLAIRE:  Don't bring him back, Kate.  Don't you dare bring him back.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE:  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Is he okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: He's fine. It's a miracle.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: I can't believe he did it.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Who did what?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Locke. He moved the island.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: No, he didn't.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Oh, really? 'Cause... one minute it was there, and the next it was gone, so... unless we, like, overlooked it, Dude, that's exactly what he did. But... if you've got another explanation, man, I'd love to hear it.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: God almighty. There's a boat. There's a boat out there! There's a boat out there. Hey! There's a boat! You see it?! Hey! Hey! Hey! Over here! Does it see us?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: I think it does!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY AND DESMOND: Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Is it turning? It's turning! Hey! Hey!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK:  We're gonna have to lie.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: What?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK:  We're gonna have to lie.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Lie about what?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Everything, all of it, every moment since we crashed on the island.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Jack... now, I know I'm new to this group and everything, but isn't this the place where everybody starts jumping up and down and hugging each other?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Your freighter... those men came to the island to kill us, all of us. You said that our plane was discovered on the bottom of the ocean. Well, someone put it there—someone who wants everyone to think that we're dead. So what do you think's gonna happen to us when we tell them that that wasn't our plane? What do you think's gonna happen to the people that we left behind?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Jack, we can't. We can't pull it off.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Just let me do the talking.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MAN: Aponta adiante, lá! Lá!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MAN: Uma jangada. Cheio de gente! São oito deles!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MAN: De onde eles vieram? De onde eles vieram?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HENRIK: Ei, aqui! Dá uma olhada aqui!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MAN: Depressa! Pega uns cobertores e a caixa de primeiros socorros. Traga pra aqui agora.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HENRIK: Uma jangada com pessoas, Ms. Widmore!  Ms. Widmore, venha à proa!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 PENNY: Throw them a rope! Take them 'round to the stern!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: Penny? Penny! Penny!
Lost.Season04.Episode13 PENNY: Are you okay?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND:  I'm—I'm fine.  I'm fine.  H—how did you find me?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 PENNY: Your phone call... I have a tracking station. 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: I love you, Penny... and I'll never leave you again.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 MAN: Não, não, não. Não faz isso. Não faz isso. Tá bom, tá bom, tá bom. Chega pra lá. Chega, chega.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: Uh... this is—this is Penny. This is, um, Kate and then Aaron.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 KATE: Hi.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 PENNY: Hi.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: Um... and this is Sun, Sayid, Hurley.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Hi.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: This is Frank. And Jack. Jack, this is—this is Penny.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: It's nice to meet you, Penny.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 PENNY: Hi.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK:  But we need to talk.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: What's this place called?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Membata.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 HURLEY: Membata. Why are we doing this, Dude? Sailing 3,000 miles to another island?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 SAYID: Because it's the only way to keep them safe.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: How long till we'll hit land?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Well, if the wind's not too brutal... eight, nine hours.  Just long enough to give you a nice, convincing sunburn.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Well... it's been a pleasure, Frank. I hope we never see each other again.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Roger that, Doc. 
Lost.Season04.Episode13 PENNY:  Bye, sweetheart.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND:  Are you sure about this, brother?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Are you sure?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND:  As long as I've got Penny... I'll be fine.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Don't let him find you, Desmond. And I'll see you in another life, brother.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 DESMOND: Aye. I guess you will.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: All right. Let's go home.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Hello, Jack.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. Did he tell you that I was off the island?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK:  Yes, he did.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: When did you speak to him?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK:  About a month ago.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: And Kate?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Yeah. Yeah, he came to see her, too.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: And what did he say to you?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: He told me... that after I left the island, some very bad things happened. And he told me that it was my fault for leaving. And he said that I had to come back.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Yes, I heard that you've been flying on passenger planes... hoping that you'd crash. It's dark, Jack, very dark.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: Why are you here?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: I'm here to tell you that the island won't let you come alone. All of you have to go back.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK:  Are you...  Sayid—I don't even know where Sayid is. Hurley...  is insane. Sun blames me for... and then Kate...  She won't even talk to me anymore.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Perhaps I can help you with that. This is the way it has to be, Jack. It's the only way. You have to do it together, all of you.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 JACK: How?
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: I have a few ideas.
Lost.Season04.Episode13 BEN: Jack... I said, all of you. We're gonna have to bring him, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 WIFE: Ah. Mm. Baby's awake.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 WIFE: It's your turn.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RECORD: Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear / Bitin' on a bullet pullin' out all of his hair
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RECORD: Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RECORD: Well, you can't make a record if you—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RECORD: Can't make a record if you— Can't make a record if you— Can't make a record if you— Can't make a record if you—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DIRECTOR: Morning. Here you go, Doc.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHANG: I don't need a script. Let's go. I don't have all day.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SOUND MAN: Speed.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DIRECTOR: Okay. DHARMA orientation film number two, take one.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DIRECTOR: And... action.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHANG: Hello. I'm Dr. Marvin Candle, and this is the orientation film for station two, the Arrow. Given your specific area of expertise, you should find it no surprise that this station's primary purpose is to develop defensive strategies and gather intelligence on the island's hostile indigenous population—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MAN: Dr. Chang! Dr. Chang?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHANG: Damn it! What the hell?!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DIRECTOR: Cut!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MAN: Sir, we got a problem down at the Orchid.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FOREMAN: Over here. We were cutting through the rock, right on your specs. That's when the drill melted.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHANG: The drill melted?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FOREMAN: Yeah, yeah. 3 meters in. We went through six carbon drill bits, and the last one just fried.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FOREMAN: Then my operator starts grabbing his head and freaking out. We sonar-imaged the wall. There's an open chamber about 20 meters in, behind the rock.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FOREMAN: There's something in there. And the only way to get to it is to lay charges here and here and blast through it and take a look—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHANG: Under no circumstances! This station is being built here because of its proximity to what we believe to be an almost limitless energy. And that energy, once we can harness it correctly, it's going to allow us to manipulate time.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FOREMAN:  Right. Okay, so, what? We're gonna go back and kill Hitler?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHANG: Don't be absurd. There are rules, rules that can't be broken.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FOREMAN: So what do you want me to do?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHANG: You're gonna do nothing. If you drill even 1 centimeter further, you risk releasing that energy. If that were to happen...
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHANG: ...God help us all.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 WORKER:  All right, get him up.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FOREMAN: Come on. Let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHANG: Watch yourself!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 TANK CARRYING WORKER: Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 WORKER:  We need a doctor.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FOREMAN: Come on. I'll grab the rest of his stuff. Let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FOREMAN: Did you hear that? Time travel. How stupid does that guy think we are?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FOREMAN: Let's go, guys.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BEN: Why don't you close that up now, Jack? Come on. Let's get him in the van. It's out back.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JACK: Where are we taking him?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BEN: We'll worry about that once we pick up Hugo.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JACK:  Hurley... is locked away in a mental institution.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BEN: Which should make recruiting him considerably easier than the rest of your friends.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JACK: They're not my friends anymore.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BEN: Oh, that's the spirit.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JACK: How did we get here? How did all this happen?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BEN: It happened because you left, Jack. Now let's get started, shall we?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JACK: So once we get Hurley... then what?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BEN: Then we get Sun, Sayid... and Kate, of course.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JACK: I don't see that happening.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JACK: When was the last time you saw him? I mean, Locke.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BEN:  On the Island... in the Orchid station, below the greenhouse. I told him I was sorry for making his life so miserable, and then he left. So obviously John's visit to you made an impression. What did he say to make you such a believer?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JACK: Sawyer, Juliet, everyone from the boat... and everyone we left behind—John said that they'd die, too, if I didn't come back.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BEN: Did he tell you what happened to them after the Island moved?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JACK: No. No, he didn't.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BEN: Then I guess we'll never know.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: What the... Richard? Richard?! Anyone? Anyone?!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FROGURT: What happened? What was that light?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: We must've been inside the radius.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: What the hell was that?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Where's the freighter?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: Maybe it went down.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Unh-unh. No way. A minute ago, that boat was coughing black smoke. Now there's just nothin'?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: What about the helicopter?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: It was heading for that boat.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BERNARD: Rose! Rose!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: Bernard!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BERNARD: Rose! Have you seen Rose?!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 ROSE: Oh, my God! Bernard!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BERNARD: Rose! Where were you?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 ROSE: I was over...  by the church. Wh-what was that sound? What was that light?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BERNARD: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Just calm down. There's no need to panic, all right? We'll just go back to camp and—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BERNARD: "Calm down"? "No need to panic"? We can't go back to the camp.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: What the hell are you talking about?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BERNARD: There is no camp.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BERNARD: The—the sky lit up, a—and then this. The—the kitchen? Gone. And—and all the tents, all the food and water... gone. Well, everything but us. All of it. It's gone.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: It's not gone.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHARLOTTE: Daniel!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHARLOTTE: I thought you were on the freighter.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: No, we never made it. We were on our way out there when it happened.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: What do you mean, the camp's not gone? Who the hell are you anyway?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MILES: That's Dan. He's our physicist.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Listen, we have no time. I need you to take me to something man-made, something that was built, any kind of a landmark.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: There's a DHARMA station 15 minutes from here.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: You mean the hatch? The one we blew up?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: That's perfect. We should get moving before it happens again, okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Before what happens again? And why is our camp gone?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Your camp isn't gone. It hasn't been built yet.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 AARON: Choo choo! Tunnel!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE: Oh, I think Choo Choo knows better than that. He goes into that tunnel, he's never coming back out.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE: Watch your cartoons, Goober. Mommy'll be right back.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 NORTON: Ms. Austen?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE: Yes?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 NORTON: Hi, I'm Dan Norton of the law firm Agostini & Norton. May we have a moment of your time?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE:  And who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 NORTON: He's my associate. If I could just come in, I'll be glad to explain—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE: No, you can explain right here.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 NORTON: Okay, you got it. Ms. Austen, we're here to get a blood sample from you and one from your son Aaron.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 NORTON: Now, I have a court order signed by a judge for you to relinquish your blood upon being served these papers—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE: Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 NORTON: To determine your relationship to the child.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE: I'm sorry. I don't understand. Um, who's the—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 NORTON: I'm not at liberty to divulge the identity of my client.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE: Your client?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 NORTON: Please, may we come in?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE: Get off my property.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 NORTON: If you won't comply, then I'm going to have to come back with the sheriff.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE: Then come back with the sheriff.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 AARON: Where you going, mommy?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE: We're going on vacation, baby.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 KATE: Say bye-bye, baby.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: Why did you jump off that helicopter?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: I told you. We were runnin' out of gas. I wanted to make sure she—(sighs) I wanted to make sure they got back to the boat. Don't matter now anyway, does it?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Excuse me. I really need the two of you to pick up the pace. Okay? Thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: First things first. Gimme your shirt.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: My shirt?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: I really think we have far more pressing matters than me giving you a shirt. How about we just keep moving, okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: How about we call a time-out so you can tell us what the hell is going on?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: How about you trust me?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Trust you? I don't know you!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: We really do not have time for me to try to explain. You have no idea how difficult that would be for me to try to explain this—this phenomenon to a quantum physicist. That would be difficult, so for me to try to explain whatever is happening—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHARLOTTE: Oi! What in bloody hell do you think you're doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Shut it, Ginger, or you're gettin' one, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Now talk.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: The Island...  think of the Island like a record spinning on a turntable... only now, that record is skipping. Whatever Ben Linus did down at the Orchid station... I think... it may have... dislodged us.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MILES: Dislodged us from what?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Time.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: So that's why our camp is gone? Because the Island is moving through time?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Yeah, either the Island is, or we are.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: And it's just as likely that we're moving, your people and us. And everyone in your group—you're all accounted for, right?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER:  Not everyone. ...Locke.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Is anyone there?!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Hello?!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Hello?!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Hey!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Uhh!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 ETHAN: Who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Well, listen, listen—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 ETHAN: How many others onboard?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: You don't understand. I didn't come on that plane.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 ETHAN: Wrong answer.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: No, wait! Stop! Stop! I know you. I know who you are. Your name... your name is Ethan. Your name is Ethan.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 ETHAN: Who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: My name is John Locke. I know this is gonna be hard to understand, but Ben Linus appointed me as your leader.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 ETHAN: That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 ETHAN: Good-bye, John Locke.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Great.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: So when are we now, whiz kid?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: We're either in the past... or we're in the future.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 WOMAN: Flight 23 to Paris will begin boarding at gate 15. Please have your boarding passes ready.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 TICKETING AGENT:  Evening, ma'am. Where you flying to tonight?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SUN: Los Angeles.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 TICKETING AGENT: Of course. May I see your passport, please?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SUN: Mm-hmm.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 TICKETING AGENT: Excuse me. Could you wait here for just one moment, Ms. Kwon?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SUN: Hey! Where are you going?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SUN: Open this door. Open this door!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 WIDMORE: Save your breath.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 WIDMORE: They only do what I tell them to do.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SUN: You. You had me brought in here? Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 WIDMORE: You had the audacity to approach me in broad daylight in front of my business associates... in public. Why did I have you brought here? Because you showed me no respect. I will be respected, Sun.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SUN: Fair enough.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 WIDMORE: Since you seem to be worried about your plane, I'll get right down to business. You mentioned that you and I had... common interests. Why don't you tell me exactly what they might be?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SUN: To kill Benjamin Linus.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:  The victim was found shot in his car on the grounds of the Santa Rosa hospital, a private mental health care facility outside Los Angeles.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JACK: Okay. Let's go get him.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR: Police have now identified their suspect in the shooting as a patient at the hospital who escaped earlier this evening—Hugo Reyes.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR: Now if that name sounds familiar to you, that's because Reyes was a member of the infamous Oceanic Six. As to why he may have murdered a visitor to the facility where Reyes lived for two years, that remains a complete mystery.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 BEN:  Well... looks like we have a change of plan.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY:  Here she comes, right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 WAITRESS: Here's your order, sir.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAYID: Keep the change.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 WAITRESS: Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY:  Awesome.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY: You want a fry?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAYID: No, thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY: You know, maybe if you ate more comfort food you wouldn't have to go around shooting people.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY: So that dude you popped outside Santa Rosa—who was he?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAYID: I don't care. He was armed and he was watching you. That made him an enemy.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY: Do you think he was gonna kill me?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAYID: I'm not taking any risks. After Bentham died—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY: You mean Locke.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAYID: Yes, I mean Locke.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY: I need a cool code name.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY: So when'd you become so paranoid?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAYID: If you'd spent the last two years doing the things I was doing, you'd be paranoid, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY: Oh, yeah? Paranoid like what? What kind of things?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAYID: I was working for Benjamin Linus.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY: Wait. He's on our side now?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAYID: Listen to me, Hurley. If you ever have the misfortune of running into him, whatever he tells you, just do the opposite.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAYID: Wait here.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FIRST MAN: Is he all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SECOND MAN: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FIRST MAN: Is he breathing or what?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 THIRD MAN: Who is that? Check him out.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FIRST MAN: Look out! That guy's got a gun!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SECOND MAN: Run!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FIRST MAN: Get out of here! Call the cops! Hurry!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY: Sayid! Whoa. You okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAYID: Get me to the car.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 HURLEY: Dude. Dude. Oh, man. I thought it was supposed to be a safe house. I never should've left the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHARLOTTE: Hey, do you think he's looking for us?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MILES: Who?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHARLOTTE: Widmore.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MILES: It took him, like, 20 years to find this place the first time. I'll start holding my breath now.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: Over here!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Is this the hatch?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: It was. Blown up, just like we left it.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Okay. So when we are now... it's now after you and your people crashed on the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: You sayin' our camp is back on the beach again?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: It's possible, yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Good. I'm going back.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Hey. No, no. It's pointless.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: More pointless than staring at a hole in the ground?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: We don't know when the next flash is coming. By the time you get back to the beach, the camp could be gone again.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Yeah, but what if it ain't? Hell, what if the helicopter hasn't even taken off yet?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: We could warn them, stop them from ever flying to that boat.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: That's not the way it works.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Who says?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: You cannot change anything. You can't. Even if you tried to, it wouldn't work.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Why not?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Time—it's like a street, all right? We can move forward on that street, we can move in reverse, but we cannot ever create a new street. If we try to do anything different, we will fail every time. Whatever happened, happened.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: How do you know so much about this, Danny Boy?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY:  I know about this because... I've spent my entire adult life studying space-time. I know all this because this journal contains everything I've ever learned about the DHARMA Initiative. This is why I'm here. I know what's happening.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: So how can we stop it?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: We can't stop it.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Then who can?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE:  Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Aah! 
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Richard?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: Hey, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Richard... what is happening?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: What's happening is that you're bleeding to death. Here.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: I need to get the bullet out.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: Because you told me there was, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: No, no. No, I didn't.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: Well... you will.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: It was Ethan who shot me.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: Well...  what comes around, goes around.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Aah! When am I?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: Well, John, that—that's all relative.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Wait, wait. When the sky lit up... where did you go?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: I didn't go anywhere, John. You went. All right, this—this is gonna hurt. It'll be a lot worse if you move, okay? Hold still.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Uhh!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: All done.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE:  Jeez.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: I don't understand. How—how did you know that I was here? How did you know where to find me?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: I wish I had time to explain it, John. But you're gonna be moving on soon, and we need to go over a couple of things before you do.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: "Moving on"? Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: Sorry. The first thing, okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: You're gonna need to clean out the wound every couple of hours and keep as much weight off the leg as you can, all right? The Island'll do the rest, John, all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: But I don't—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: Second thing—no, no, pay attention. Next time we see each other, I'm not gonna recognize you. All right? You give me this. All right?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: What is this?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: It's a compass.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: What does it do?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: It points north, John. Look, I wish I had time to be more sensitive about this because it's a lot to swallow, but you need to know it in order to do what you gotta do. So I'm just gonna say it, okay?  The only way to save the Island, John, is to get your people back here—the ones who left.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: Jack, Kate... The chopper was headed for the boat. The boat—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: No, they're fine, John, and they're already home, so you have to convince them to come back.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 LOCKE: How—how am I supposed to do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 RICHARD: You're gonna have to die, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MILES: So... what was this thing before you guys blew it up?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: A DHARMA station.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MILES: For what?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: There was a man named Desmond living down in it. He was pushing a button every 108 minutes to save the world.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MILES: Really?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: Yeah. Really.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Son of a...
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: ...bitch!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: The hatch—it's back. I guess you haven't found it yet.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MILES: Hey! Where you goin'?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Back door. I'm gettin' some supplies.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: James, wait. Not a good idea.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: The sky can flash all it wants, but I ain't startin' over, Dilbert. I ain't rubbin' two sticks together and starting a fire, and I ain't huntin' damn boar! There's DHARMA food, beer, and clothing in there. And I'm gettin' Desmond to let me in one way or another.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: That's not gonna work, my friend.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Yeah? Why not?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Because Desmond didn't know you when he first came out of there. That means you've never met, which means you can't meet.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: That would all be fascinating if I was listening to ya.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: So how do you know Desmond is even in there? Think about it. It could be anybody.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: I don't care who's in there.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Wait. Wait.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Open the damn door!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: It won't work.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Sure it will. Yo, open up! It's the Ghost of Christmas Future!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: No one—no one is gonna answer.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Open! Open the damn door! Open the door!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: You're wasting your time.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Open up! I know you can hear me.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: If it didn't happen, it can't happen.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Open the damn door!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: You can't change the past, James!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 SAWYER: Everybody I care about just blew up on your damn boat. I know what I can't change.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET:  We should get back to the beach. It's been a long day.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MILES: Why are we going back to the beach if there's nothing to go back to?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 JULIET: So stay here.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MILES:  That chick likes me.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHARLOTTE: What? Wh—what? What's the matter?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: You... 
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHARLOTTE: Ugh. I haven't had a nosebleed since I was little. Dan, I'm fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Yeah. No, no, no, you're—um, of course you're fine. I'm, uh... you know, the sight of blood is...
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHARLOTTE: Yeah, well, it's a good thing you're a physicist then, isn't it? Shall we?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Yeah, um... my pack. Of course I left my pack back at the hatch crater. I better get it. Why don't you head back with everyone else? And I'll be right behind you.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 CHARLOTTE: Don't dillydally.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: I wouldn't think of it.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY:  Please let this work. Please let this work. Please, please, please, let this work.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Oh! Oh! Whoa! Whoa. Don't shoot.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 MAN:  Then you'd best explain why you've been bangin' on my door for the last 20 minutes, brother.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY:  Desmond.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DESMOND:  Are you him?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: "Him"? Who?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DESMOND: My replacement.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: No, I'm not.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: I'm not. I'm not. I'm...
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DESMOND: Do I know you?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Yeah... in a way. But listen, that's not important. What is important, Desmond, is what I'm about to say to you. I need you to listen. You're the only person who can help us because, Desmond... the rules... the rules don't apply to you. You're special. You're uniquely and miraculously special.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DESMOND: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Okay, listen to me. Listen! If the helicopter somehow made it off the Island, if you got home—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DESMOND: What helicopter? What are you talking about?!
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: Listen, I need you to listen, or people are gonna die. My name is Daniel Faraday, and right now me and everyone else you left behind—we're in serious danger. You're the only person who can help us. I need you to go back to Oxford University. Go back to where we met.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 FARADAY: I need you to go there and find my mother. Her name is—
Lost.Season05.Episode01 PENNY: Are you all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DESMOND:  I was on the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DESMOND: I was on the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 PENNY: You've been off the Island for three years now.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 PENNY: You're safe now. It was just a dream.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DESMOND: It wasn't a dream, Pen.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DESMOND: It was a memory.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 PENNY: Desmond, where are you going? Des?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 PENNY: Desmond? What are you doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DESMOND: We're leaving.
Lost.Season05.Episode01 PENNY: Leaving to go where?
Lost.Season05.Episode01 DESMOND: Oxford.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Dude, they'll find out.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Not if we stick to the story.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAYID: I don't know, Jack. It could be a risk.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: It's the only way. We have to do this.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 LAPIDUS: They're still at it, huh?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Look, we're running out of time. We gotta make a decision now. So are we all okay with this?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAYID: This is a decision that will affect the rest of our lives. I'm not taking it lightly.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Kate?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Sun?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Frank?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 LAPIDUS: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Sorry you got dragged into this, but we need to know that you're with us.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 LAPIDUS: Whatever you guys decide, I'll just roll with.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Hurley, what about you?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I don't think we should lie, dude.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: We need to protect the people that we left behind, Hurley.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: How does lying protect them?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: It protects them from Charles Widmore. The guy hired a boatload of people to kill all of us. He faked a plane crash. I mean, you think telling him the truth, he's just gonna—he's gonna leave them alone?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY:  Look, he's your dad, right? Can't you just, like... call him off?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 PENNY: There's no calling my father off.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: But he'll never find them. I mean, the Island disappeared. We all saw it. It's gone. Bloop!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: You think anyone's gonna believe that... believe any of it? They're gonna think you're crazy.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Not if someone backs me up. Sayid, come on. They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth. But what if we all do? And if we can stick together, we can make 'em believe us. I don't want to spend the rest of my life lying. Do you?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAYID: No. But... I don't believe we have a better choice.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAYID: Sorry, Hurley, but we have to lie.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: You know what, dude? I'm gonna remember this. And someday, you're gonna need my help, and I'm telling you right now... you're not gettin' it.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Wake up, Sayid! Sayid! Sayid, wake up! Sayid!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: No, no, no, no, no! What do I do?!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: What am I supposed to do?!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Okay, okay, okay. Just stay calm.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ANA LUCIA: What the hell were you thinking?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Ana Lucia?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ANA LUCIA: You were driving like a maniac. And why'd you pull over?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I just... I—I thought—
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ANA LUCIA: You didn't think. What if I were real? What if a real cop stopped you? They already have pictures of you covered in blood with a gun in your hand.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY:  Actually, it's ketchup. We went to a—a drive-thru, and, uh...
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ANA LUCIA: Well, you need to pull it together. You've got a lot of work to do.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I do?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ANA LUCIA: Let's start with the basics. First off, you need new clothes. Then you need to go to a safe place. And take Sayid to somebody you trust. You getting all this?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY:  Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ANA LUCIA:  Then get to it. And stay away from the cops.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ANA LUCIA: Do not get arrested.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Thanks, Ana Lucia.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ANA LUCIA: Oh, yeah. Libby says hi.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Well... you heard her.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ROSE: You really think that thing's gonna work?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BERNARD: Rose, I told you a hundred times. Of course it's gonna work. Yes. I worked hard on it. It's better than rubbing two sticks together.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ROSE: Well, I heard that's what you're supposed to do, is rub—
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BERNARD: Yeah? Well, I think this is gonna work better, all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ROSE: Well, I think you got too much wood here in the inside. That's gonna smother the leaves.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BERNARD: Rose, if you don't have enough wood, the leaves just burn out.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FROGURT: Fire? Who cares about fire? Any minute the sky could light up, and who the hell knows what could happen this time?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ROSE: Neil, we are trying to focus on what we can control. You are either gonna help or be quiet!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Whose shirt is this?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FROGURT: It's mine.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Can I have it?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FROGURT: What does it matter? We're all gonna be dead by sundown.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: I'll take that as a "yes," Frogurt.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FROGURT: It's Neil.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Yeah, yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Still in one piece?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: As far as I can tell.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: I figured it would've disappeared with the rest of our stuff.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: I guess whatever we had with us when we moved is along for the ride.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: Look who's back.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Welcome back, Dr. Wizard.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MILES: I think it's Mr. Wizard.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Shut up.  You've been gone for two hours. What the hell were you doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FARADAY: Yeah, you're absolutely right. I'm sorry. I...  left my pack in the jungle and I was coming back I—I—I just—it was a while before I realized that I was just... uh, I was really lost.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Well, you figure out when the sky's gonna light up again?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FARADAY: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Well, you at least got a plan?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: I think we should take the Zodiac, head to a shipping lane.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FARADAY: No. No, no, no. We can't just sail out on any course. For us to leave, I need to calculate a new bearing, and, uh, to do that...
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FARADAY: ...I need to determine where we are now... in time.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: And what are the rest of us supposed to do?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MILES: I'm gonna go find us something to eat.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: And how are you planning on doing that?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MILES: Don't worry about it.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: I guess we'll get the water.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Dude, wake up! Come on. I can't do this on my own!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I promise I'll pay you back.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Wait right here.
Lost.Season05.Episode02  my Wirehaired" shirt for a yellow one that says "I  my Shih-Tzu".]
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CLERK: Shih Tzus?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I like Shih Tzus.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CLERK: It looks like you "heart" them.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CLERK:  Rough night?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CLERK:  Your friend's pretty wasted.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CLERK: I know you from somewhere, don't I?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CLERK:  I think I do. Yeah, you definitely look familiar.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I just have one of those faces.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CLERK: You're lying.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I don't believe in lying.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CLERK: I remember! You're the guy who won the lottery... and crashed in that plane!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: No. I must look like him.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CLERK: You're him. Hey! Buy a ticket here. If you win, we get a commission. You're good luck.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Sorry. Wrong dude. Keep the change.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Okay. Okay, we're outta here.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 AARON: Mommy, I wanna go home.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Look at your book, baby.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Hello? .... I—I can't believe it's you. .... No. Hi. How are you? ... Wait, you're in L.A.? ... Of course I can meet, yeah. What... I know exactly where that is. I'll be there in half an hour.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 AARON: Mommy, where are we going?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: To see a friend.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: You looking for your pills, Jack? I flushed them down the toilet.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK:  Thank you. I was just gonna do that myself.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: Yeah, I figured you were.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Going somewhere?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: I'm checking out.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Where are we going?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: You're going home. And find yourself a suitcase. If there's anything in this life you want, pack it in there... because you're never coming back.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Good. 
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: Good. I'll pick you up in six hours.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: And where will you be going?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: John's casket is outside in a carpet van. I need to move it somewhere safe.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Safe? He's dead, isn't he?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: I'll see you in six hours, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Mmm.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Mmm.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ANNOUNCER:  Previously on Exposé...
Lost.Season05.Episode02 WOMAN 1:  It looks like the Scorpion is taking over all the Cobra's business.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 WOMAN 2:  You want me to work with Tsunami, the Dragon Lady of Van Nuys?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 WOMAN 1:  Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 WOMAN 2:  I'm here to capture the Scorpion, so if you've got a problem with that, you can go work Stage 3.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MAN:  She's hit!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Hmm.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Hey, Dad. How's it going?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: You seen the news?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: No. I just got up. Why, are you wanted again?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Uh, yeah. Kinda. Is Mom here?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: No, she's out shopping. Hey, set him over there. Oh, man, he's out.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Is he... breathing?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Barely. What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: He got shot by a dart.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Dart? What, were you in the zoo or something?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: No, we were at the safe house.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Safe house?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Sayid took me there to protect me. Then these two guys jumped down, they shot him with darts, and now he's—he's in a coma or something.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Hugo, this doesn't make sense. And what are you doing out of the mental institution?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Sayid pulled me out. I'm in danger. We both are.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Danger from who?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY:  I'm not sure exactly.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Hello?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DETECTIVE:  Mr. and Mrs. Reyes? L.A.P.D. Can you open the gate, please?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID:  Just what kind of trouble are you in?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Dad, please! Just don't tell 'em I'm here!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: All right, but then you're gonna tell me the truth.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DETECTIVE: Well, give us a call if you hear anything. We really appreciate it.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Thanks, bye-bye. I'll have to tell him.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: You killed three people?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: No. Sayid did.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Oh. Well, that's better. Come on. Let's get him to the couch.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: He saved me.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: I think we should call a lawyer—right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: No, no, no. We can't go public. They're after us.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Who? Who is after you?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I don't know. Sayid knows. He can explain.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Sayid ain't explaining nothing. We need to get him to a hospital.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Did you not hear me? People are trying to kill us. We go to a hospital, they'll find us! Like—like The Godfather. It's the last place you go. Everyone knows it. Wh—they—they smother you with pillows and make it look like an accident. Sayid, please wake up!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: That's not gonna work. We need a doctor.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I think I know what to do.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 AARON: Mommy, Mommy, can I push the button?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Sure you can, sweetie. But we're all the way to the top, okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: So I want you to press number 3-1. You see it? You see it? Okay. You get it. 3-1.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Yeah! That's the one! You pressed it! You pressed it!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Hi.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: Hello, Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JILL: Have a nice day. I'll be right with you.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JILL: Hello, Ben. If it's the Porterhouse you're looking for, we're out.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: No, no Porterhouse. I do, however, have something very important in my van, Jill, and I need you to watch it for me.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JILL: Is it what I think it is?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: It is.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JILL: He'll be safe with me.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in yet?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JILL: Yeah. Everything's moving right on schedule. How's it going with Shephard?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: He's with us.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JILL: Really? What'd you do, bribe him with some pills?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN:  Cut the man some slack. He's been through a lot. We all have.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JILL: Right. Of course.  Sorry.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: So keep him safe, Jill. Because if you don't... everything we're about to do... won't matter at all.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ROSE: Aah!  Oh, you got it! You got it! You got it! You got it. You got it.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MAN: All right! Finally we got...
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ROSE: Why did you do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BERNARD: Because you're supposed to fan the flame, Rose.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FROGURT: I thought you said you knew how to start a fire.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ROSE: And I thought you said you didn't care.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FROGURT: I care about surviving.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ROSE: I think you need to take a time-out, Neil.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ROSE: You'll get it, Bernard. You will.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BERNARD: Yeah. All right.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ROSE: Just—just try again.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FARADAY: Hey. Give me one second.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CHARLOTTE:  I got you something.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FARADAY: Ooh. Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: I found these in the jungle.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FARADAY: Look at that. Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: There was only two, but I thought we could both do with a bite to eat. 
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FARADAY: Thank you very much, very much.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FARADAY: You all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: I just can't seem to shake this bloody headache. 
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FARADAY: Well... I'm sure it'll pass.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: No, it's not just that. It's the weirdest thing. Earlier, I was... I was thinking about my mom, and all of sudden, I—I couldn't remember her maiden name. I mean, isn't that odd?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FARADAY: Don't worry about it. Listen, all of us have been under a lot of stress. Okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Daniel... do you know what's happening to me?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MILES: Dinner!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BERNARD: That's great! Wow! Where'd you get that?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MILES: I found it.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: What do you mean you "found" it?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MILES:  It died in the jungle. I found it. Don't worry. It's fine. It's only been dead three hours.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MALE SURVIVOR: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MILES: Who's got a knife?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FROGURT: A knife? You need a knife? Oh, it's over by the Cuisinart next to the stove.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MILES: What's your problem?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FROGURT: My problem is, we don't have a knife. W—we don't have anything. And it wouldn't even matter if we did, 'cause Bernie the dentist can't even start a fire.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Hey, ease up there, Frogurt.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FROGURT: It's Neil, you inbred!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FROGURT: And I'm not gonna ease up, 'cause I'm tired and I'm hungry and I'm screwed! We're all screwed!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: Calm down, Neil. We're gonna get through this.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FROGURT: How are any of us gonna get through this?! Didn't you hear what I just said?! We can't even get fire!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 FROGURT: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Run!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Come on! Split up! Everybody, get to the creek!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CHARLOTTE: Ow! Dan!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 WOMAN: Keep moving!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MAN: Aah! Uhh!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 ANOTHER MAN:  Uhh! Uhh!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Come on. He's dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: No!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Come on! You wanna be dead, too?! Come on!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: There's nothing you coulda done. We gotta go now!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Dude, they're on a stakeout?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: You just escaped from a mental institution. There's dead bodies everywhere! Of course they're on a stakeout! They think you're crazy enough to come back home. S—so are you... crazy?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Do you think I am?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Well, either that or you're lying to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I'm not crazy, and I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: W—well, what is it?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: Why there is a dead Pakistani on my couch?!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: He's not dead, Ma.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: Well, he's not breathing.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: He's not?!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: It's okay, Carmen. We have a plan.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: A plan? What are you talking about?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: He is breathing... kind of. Dad, we gotta go now.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: Hugo, what's happening?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Mom, please!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: No "Mom, please" me! Why are you all over the news? Do you know what they are telling about you?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Yeah, Mom. I know. Look, everything's gonna make sense. I promise.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: It better!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Officers.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: So how long are you in L.A.?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: Just a few days. I have some business to attend to. But I wanted to see you.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: Here it is. Her name's Ji Yeon. Here's a baby picture.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Oh! She's beautiful.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: Thank you. She's with her grandmother in Seoul. I hope someday you get to meet her. It would be nice to see her and Aaron play together.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: Kate? Are you all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Yeah. I'm fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: Are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Somebody knows we're lying.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Some lawyers came to see me.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: Who?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Two men. They came to my house and they asked for a blood sample. Some kind of lawsuit. They wanted to test to see if... to see if Aaron's my son.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: Who did these lawyers represent?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: I don't know. They wouldn't tell me who their client is.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: Then they're not interested in exposing the lie.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: How do you know?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: Because if they were, they would just do it. They wouldn't come to you in private. They don't care that we're lying. They just want Aaron.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: But who... who would do that? We—
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: I don't know, but you need to take care of them.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: What do you mean, "take care of them"?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: Wouldn't you do anything you had to in order to keep Aaron?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE:  What kind of a person do you think I am?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN:  Jin! Jin!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: The kind of person who makes hard decisions when she has to.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE:  You get the baby on the chopper. I'll get Jin.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: Like you did on the freighter. You told me to get on the helicopter, and you said you'd get Jin.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK:  We gotta get outta here!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: Sun, I hope you don't think...
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: But you did what you had to do. And if you hadn't... we probably all would've died instead of just my husband.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE:  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 KATE: I... 
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: I don't blame you.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SUN: So... How's Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Hugo said I could trust you. I wasn't so sure. But he swore I could, so... can I?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Yes. Of course.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: All right.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: What happened to him?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Hugo said he got hit with some dart. Must've been some drugs or something.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: And where is Hurley right now?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: At our house, freaking out.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Let me get my car. Help me move him over. I'm gonna have to get him to the hospital.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: No. No, H—Hugo said that whoever did this—they'll come back after him.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: All due respect, Mr. Reyes, but you brought him to me, so I'm gonna do what I think is best for Sayid.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: All right, fine. Take him to the hospital. But with all due respect to you, Dr. Shephard, when this is over, you're gonna do something for me.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DAVID: Stay away from Hugo. Whatever it is you talked him into, something tells me you don't have his best interests at heart. So stay away from my son.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN:  Hello?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Ben... you'll never guess who just showed up at my door.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: Who?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Sayid.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: Who is Sayid? I thought he was your friend.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: He is my friend... but he's also got this double life where he does crazy Ninja moves and spy stuff. But he's a good guy.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: A good guy doesn't kill three men. A good guy doesn't kill any men.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Mom—
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: Don't "mom" me. You are in terrible trouble, Hugo.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: The news thinks you did this. And if the news does, everyone does. Why is this happening? How can anybody want to hurt you?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: Tell your mother the truth.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: We lied, Ma!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: What do you mean you lied?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY:  All of us—the Oceanic Six, we lied about what happened after the crash.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: And what did happen?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Okay. See, we did crash, but it was on this crazy island. And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue. And there was a smoke monster, and then there were other people on the island. We called them the Others, and they started attacking us. And we found some hatches, and there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or... well, I was never really clear on that. But... the Others didn't have anything to do with the hatches. That was the DHARMA Initiative. The Others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us. And then we teamed up with the Others because some worse people were coming on a freighter. Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us. So we stole their helicopter and we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up. And we couldn't go back to the island because it disappeared, so then we crashed into the ocean, and we floated there for a while until a boat came and picked us up. And by then, there were six of us. That part was true.  But the re...
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: But the rest of the people... who were on the plane? They're still on that island.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 CARMEN: I believe you. I don't understand you, but I believe you.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: A lot of people died, ma. And now this bad stuff is happening because... well, um...  we shouldn't have lied. 
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Ow!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET:  You okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Yeah, I'm fine. I just stepped on something. Something jammed...!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER:  Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: We should keep moving. We gotta hook up with everybody at the creek.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: It's a long creek, James. Which part?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: I don't know—the wet part. Sorry if my plan's not up to others' stan—
Lost.Season05.Episode02 [Leaves rustle, footsteps approach. Sawyer and Juliet step back and crouch behind some cover. They observe a man in a uniform walking with a rifle. When it appears he has gone, they sigh.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER:  Who were those people? Are they yours? Did they shoot the arrows?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: You want me to crawl out there and ask 'em?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: You don't have to be a wiseass. I'm just trying to—
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET:  Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Hey!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JONES:  What are you doing on our island?!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 VOICE OVER P.A.: Respiratory therapist to ICU. Respiratory therapist...
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Come on. Son of a bitch. Come on, Sayid. Come on.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Say—  Sayid. It—it's... it's Jack. Hey! Uhh!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK:  It's okay. It's all right. You're okay. You're all right.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Ahh.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAYID: What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: You're fine. You're in the hospital. Hurley's father brought you to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAYID: Hurley's father?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: Sayid, you've been attacked.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAYID: Where's Hurley?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: He's at his parents' house.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAYID: Who's with him?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JACK: I don't know. His mother, maybe?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAYID: Does anyone else know he's there?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Aah!  Aah.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: Hello, Hugo.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Get away from me. Get away!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: Hugo, I know you're in trouble, and I can assure you I've taken care of everything.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: I have a car waiting for us out back. The police didn't see me come in. I can get you out of here.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: No way, dude. Sayid warned me about you.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: I'm taking you to Sayid. He's with Jack. That's why I'm here, Hugo. Jack called me. How else would I know that they're together?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: No. You're—you're playing one of your mind games. They would never trust you.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: In their defense, I'm not an easy person to trust. But they came around when they realized that we all want the same thing.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: And what's that?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: To go back to the Island. Come with us, Hugo... and this'll be over. You can stop hiding. You can stop worrying about the stories and the deceptions. If you come with me, you won't ever have to lie again.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: Please. Let me help you.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Never, dude.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Hey! Hey, you got me! That's right, you got me! That's right! I'm the killer!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DETECTIVE: Stop!  Police!  Face your back towards me! Slowly drop down to your knees!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I'm the killer. I'm crazy. I'm a murderer. I killed four people... three people. However many are dead, I killed them. I killed them.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: I killed them all. J—just—just get me away from here.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DETECTIVE: You have the right to remain silent. Anything can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DETECTIVE: You have the right to speak to an attorney and to have one present during any questioning...
Lost.Season05.Episode02 HURLEY: Just get me out of here.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 DETECTIVE: If you can't afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JONES: I'm gonna make this quite simple for you. You're gonna tell me what you're doing, how many of you there are and how you got here.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Let her go.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JONES: Unless you're answering my questions, don't speak! I want you to tell me everything or I'll cut off her other hand.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: What?!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Other?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JONES: The first one isn't negotiable.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JONES: It's just to illustrate how serious I am.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: No!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Hold on! Hold on! Chill out! We're not supposed to be here. Something's happening to the Island. There are these flashes—
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JONES: Do it!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: No!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SAWYER: Wait a second! I'll tell you whatever you want to know!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JONES: Do it!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JULIET: No!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 JONES: Uhh!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MATTINGLY: Uhh! Uhh!
Lost.Season05.Episode02 LOCKE:  James. Juliet.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 LOCKE: Nice to see ya.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: Any luck?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SHROUDED WOMAN:  Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: Really?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SHROUDED WOMAN: Really. What about you?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: I'm having some... difficulties.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SHROUDED WOMAN: Well, you better get busy...  because you only have 70 hours.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: No, no, that's not enough time. I need at least—
Lost.Season05.Episode02 SHROUDED WOMAN: What you need is irrelevant.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MS. HAWKING: 70 hours is what you've got.
Lost.Season05.Episode02 BEN: Look, I lost Reyes tonight. What happens if I can't get them all to come back?
Lost.Season05.Episode02 MS. HAWKING: Then God help us all.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Efren Salonga?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Ef—Efren Salonga!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Efren Salonga?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Efren Salonga!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Efren Salonga!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Efren Salonga!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Efren Salonga?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: Who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Are you the doctor?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: Yes. What's the matter with you?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: You're sure you know what you're doing, yeah?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: Yes, yes!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Because there's a lot of blood, man!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: How much blood?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: I'm coming, Penny!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: It's okay, Pen. We've got a doctor.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: Where have you been?!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Okay, here you go.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Okay. Just breathe, Penny, okay? J—just breathe.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: Oh! 
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Breathe.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: I can't breathe.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: You're doing great.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: I can't—
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: You're doing great, okay. Okay, just be strong, yeah? Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY:  Oh, make it come out!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Just be strong.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: Hold it. Hold it.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: I can't! I can't! 
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Yes, you—yes, you can, Penny.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: Push! Push!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Okay, push now, Penny. Push. Now!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Come on, Penny. That's it.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: Push!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: It's coming. Come on, Penny.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: Push! Harder!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: I can see the head!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: Harder!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: I can see the head!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: One more time! Push!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: I can see it. It's just coming.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: It's coming! It's coming! You've got it!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: Last time! Yeah!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Oh my God, Penny.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: You got it!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: You did it. Oh, my God, Penny. You did it.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SALONGA: It's a boy!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND:  I love you, Penny. I love you.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Oh, oh, he's beautiful. Beautiful. Oh, my God. He's so beautiful. Oh, my God.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: I love you.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: I love you.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: I love you.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND:  Look. Right out there.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Beyond where you can see, there's—there's an island, and it's a very special island.  I left it a long time ago. I never thought I'd see it again.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: It's called Great Britain. And the most beautiful part of the island is Scotland, and that's where your daddy's from. There's mountains and glens and monsters in deep lochs, and... and it's where your mummy and daddy... fell in love.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: It's also where he broke her heart.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Yeah, well, I... I thought I'd leave that wee bit out of it.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: You also left out the bit about his grandfather—the man who sent a boat to the Island to kill all Daddy's friends.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: We'll be in and out. He'll never know we're here, Penny.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: Don't underestimate him, Desmond. If he finds out we're here, I don't know what he'll do.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: But this has nothing to do with your father, Penny. We are here because of Daniel Faraday.  What he told me—that everyone on that island is in danger, and I am the only one that can help them. I have to do this, Penny.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Are you sure that's what he said?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: Yeah, Sawyer said to meet at the creek, so unless he got torched by a flaming arrow, that's where he and everyone else should be.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Hey, how's your headache?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CHARLOTTE:  Worse, but considering we're running for our lives, I'm not gonna complain.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: You have any dizziness or double vision?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CHARLOTTE: Both, actually. Why do you look so worried? Is it because you know what's happening to me?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY:  Listen to me. Nothing is gonna happen to you. Nothing. I won't let it.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: Hey, we're here!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: Some rendezvous. It's just us.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY:  Well, we should probably wait, see if they show up. They could be right behind us.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CHARLOTTE: Yeah, or they came and left.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: Or they're dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Miles, that right there, that kind of attitude... not exactly what we need right now. People are scared enough as it is. Miles—Miles?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: Wait! Don't move!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MAN: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE:  Who's in charge here?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES:  He is.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE: You just couldn't stay away, could you?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Did he finish his breakfast?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: Yeah. Gave me a bit of a fight, but he listens in the end...
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: ...unlike his father.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND:  Look, honey, all I have to do is find his mother, tell her he's still on the Island, and then I'm done with this for good.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: Why now? I mean, if he told you all this on the Island, why didn't you remember it until two days ago?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: I don't know. Look, I don't understand how any of this works any more than you do. It...  Look, I know it happened. Daniel Faraday knocked on the hatch door and told me to go to Oxford... everyone was in danger, and I was the only one that could save them. I know how insane it sounds.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: I'll be back by dark, and then I'm done... forever.  I promise.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: If you're gonna promise me something, Des, can you promise me you'll never go back to that island again?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND:  Why in God's name would I ever go back there?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE:  There were twenty of you at the beach, but only five of you here. Where are the rest of your people?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: Maybe they got blown up by some more of your land mines.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE: We didn't put them here. You did.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE: Once we leave here, I will be out of control of what happens to you. But if you cooperate now, things will go much easier for you. So where are the rest of your people?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Who are these people?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: Well, gee, I didn't have time to ask that, with Frogurt on fire and all.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: They attacked us on the beach.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE:  This is a 30-caliber M1 Garand rifle. It looks new.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: Who cares about the rifle? Where the hell you been?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: If you've been going through what I have, James, maybe the more appropriate question would be, when the hell have I been?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: What happened to your leg?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: I got shot.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: By who?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: We can swap stories later. We told the rest of our group that we would meet them at the creek. If there's any chance of reconnecting with them, we'd better get moving.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: Fine, seeing as we have no rope to make sure these two don't try to kill us again. Guess we're gonna have to shoot 'em.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUNNINGHAM:  Quare non sunt vestitus eis? (Why don't they have uniforms?)
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JONES: Tace! (Be quiet!)
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER:  What?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: Cognoscitis qui sumus? (Do you know who we are?)
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: What language is that?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: They're speaking Latin. That one asked why we aren't in uniform, and this one told him to shut up.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: And how is it that they know how to speak Latin, Juliet?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: The same reason I do. Because they're Others.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES:  Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: We just walked over a fresh grave.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: Four U.S. soldiers, dead just under a month. Three of them were shot. One died of radiation poisoning.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Miles, hey, hey. Did any of them happen to mention what year it is?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE: We're here.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE: Richard! We're back.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 [Out of the darkness of the tent's interior steps Richard Alpert, looking the same as ever and wearing a blue button-down shirt and blue slacks.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 YOUNG BLONDE HOSTILE: Caught these three by the creek. This one's their leader.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: What's your name?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: What's your name?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: My name is Richard Alpert. I assume you've come back for your bomb.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ARCHIVIST:  No, I'm sorry, sir. I'm not finding a record of any Faraday.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: No, that—that's impossible. 'Cause I know her son was a professor here. His name's Daniel Faraday. I'm sure he's in your database.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ARCHIVIST: Sir, there's no record of any Faraday ever having been employed here at Oxford.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND:  I visited him. I went to his lab. It was in an attic. It was...  it was above the physics department.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ARCHIVIST: The archives go back quite far. Perhaps there was a clerical error. You don't happen to recall the year it was in which you last visited?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: The year? ...No. I'm not exactly sure.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ARCHIVIST: May I ask why you're seeking this information?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND:  Sorry I wasted your time.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUSTODIAN:  Yeah, I wouldn't touch that.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUSTODIAN: I wondered when someone'd figure out we weren't just fumigating here.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUSTODIAN: You a professor?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: No. Not exactly.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUSTODIAN: Well... at least you're honest.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: So why'd you tell me not to touch it?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUSTODIAN: Because I'm the one who had to take the rats that he made run through this bloody thing down to the incinerator so that no one would find out what he was up to.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: You mean Daniel Faraday.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUSTODIAN: Yeah. You're not the first one to poke around here, asking about him and his work. Rumor had it, he was trying to send rats' brains back in time. Ridiculous, innit?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Aye.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUSTODIAN: Look, I'll forget you broke my lock if you tell your mates that all you found was rubbish left behind by a madman.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Fair enough.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Faraday—the university says there's no record of him.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUSTODIAN: Well, can you blame 'em? I mean, after what he'd done to that poor girl?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: What girl?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Hey, take it easy.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CHARLOTTE: It's all right, Dan. I'm fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES:  We are so dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY:  Hey. No, no, no. We are not so dead. We're gonna be fine. We just need to keep it together until there's another flash. All right? Then all this disappears.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: And when's that gonna happen?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Could be five minutes. Could also be 5,000 years.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: That's—that's just awesome.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CHARLOTTE: What is going on, Dan? Why are they doing this to us?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: I'm not sure. But they must think that we're with the American military. And if that's the case, our best chance of staying alive is to let them keep thinking it, all right? Let—
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: Sorry. Am I interrupting? Ellie tells me that you're not willing to reveal where the rest of your squad is.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: And why would I do that? So you can kill them, too?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: We didn't start this, friend. Your people attacked us. You come to our island to run your tests, you fire on us, and what, you expect us not to defend ourselves?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: I don't know anything about that. We are scientists.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ALPERT: So what? So they sent you here to recover it?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: If you mean our hydrogen bomb, then yes. And I'm guessing from this man's radiation burns that the housing has been compromised. Is that right?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: You need to listen to me. You have an unstable device that's capable of destroying this entire island, and it's broken. If you don't allow me to render it inert, all of us are gonna die. All of us.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: How do I know you weren't sent here on some suicide mission? That I'll take you out to the bomb, and you'll just detonate it?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Because... I'm in love with the woman sitting next to me. And I would never... I would never do anything to hurt her.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: All right. Take care of your bomb. But you try anything else, and you will hurt her.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: So who taught you Latin?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: Others 101. Gotta learn Latin—language of the enlightened.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER:  Enlightened, my ass.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE:  I suggest you talk to us. Once we get back to the creek and meet up with the rest of our people, there's gonna be a lot of anger directed at you for attacking them.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUNNINGHAM:  The rest of your people are either captured or dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: What?  What makes you say that?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUNNINGHAM: That idiot shouted out, "Meet at the creek." We knew exactly where they were going. We sent a group after them.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: Well, maybe I should've said it in my secret language.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET:  James, wait.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: Nos non sumus hostes vobis. 
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUNNINGHAM: Itaque nos liberate. 
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: What the hell are you sayin'?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: Duce nos ad vestra castra.  Si placet. 
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUNNINGHAM: Quare hoc faciam? 
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: Estne... Ricardus ibi?  Ricardus Alpert? 
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Did you just say "Richard Alpert"?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: John, please. Duce nos ad vestra castra. Non necesse est alium mori. Si placet. 
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CUNNINGHAM: All right. Okay, we need to head east another couple of kilometers until we hit the ridge—
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: Shoot him!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: Shoot, damn it!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: Are you crazy?! What were you thinking? Why didn't you shoot him?!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Because... he's one of my people.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ABIGAIL:  And who might you be?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Uh, my name's Desmond Hume. I'm looking for Theresa Spencer.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ABIGAIL: I'm Abigail Spencer. Theresa's my sister.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Oh, right. Um, can I have a word with her?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ABIGAIL: You want to speak to Theresa?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Yeah, I got her name from a—a gentleman I met at Oxford University...um... Daniel Faraday.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ABIGAIL: Daniel Faraday? Well, why didn't you say so?  Please, you must come in.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ABIGAIL:  He didn't tell you, did he?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: No. No, he didn't. Can she hear us?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ABIGAIL: No. Theresa's away right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: "Away"? What do you mean?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ABIGAIL: Well, sometimes she wakes up, thinks she's 3, wants to know where her dolly is. Yesterday, she was talking to our dad. He died five years ago.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: I'm sorry. Um, this was a mistake. I... I shouldn't have come.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ABIGAIL: Of course. Why would you want to stay? Daniel certainly didn't.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND:  He left her like this?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ABIGAIL: Went running off to the States, never to be heard from again. He abandoned her. What kind of a man does that? I seriously don't know what we would've done if it hadn't been for Mr. Widmore.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Uh, I'm sorry. Who?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ABIGAIL: Daniel's benefactor. He funded his research, and he took responsibility for the result of it. He's been taking care of Theresa ever since this happened to her. Everything here is due to Mr. Widmore, God bless him.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: A hydrogen bomb? Seriously?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Back in the '50s, the U.S. Government tested H-bombs in the South Pacific.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: Lucky us.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CHARLOTTE: You didn't have to say that.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Say what?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CHARLOTTE: That you loved me. I mean, there are plenty of other ways you could've convinced him you weren't gonna blow up the entire Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: I said what I said because I meant it, Charlotte.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: Right, then. Let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Back soon. I promise.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: Whatever your, uh, your superiors told you, I want you to know the truth. A month ago, we found 18 members of an Army battalion right here in our jungle here, setting up this camp. We gave them the opportunity to leave the island peacefully. They weren't willing to do that, so I was forced to kill 'em. All of 'em.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Forced?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: By whom?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: Y—you answer to someone, don't you? You follow a chain of command, right?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: Yeah, well, so do I.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JONES: Richard! Richard!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ALPERT: What the hell happened to you?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JONES: Cunningham and I — a group of them surprised us. We were outnumbered, but I escaped.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: Outnumbered, eh?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JONES: Shut up, Ellie. Who's this?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: He's gonna help us take care of our problem.  You'd better get going.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JONES: Wait. He's one of them. You can't actually trust him.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: Yeah, you heard me, Ellie. Go.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: H—how did you escape?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JONES: I ran.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: And it never occurred to you that they might follow you?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JONES: Follow me? Their leader is some sodding old man. What, you think he can track me? You think he knows this island better than I do?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: How did you know Richard would be here?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: Richard's always been here.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: How old is he?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: Old. Why are you so interested in Richard, John?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: I'm interested in him because he was about to tell me how I could save us.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: "Save us"?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Yeah. But before he could finish, we were interrupted by that flash of light. And I'm hoping we can pick up where we left off.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: I hate to bust up the "I'm an Other, you're an Other" reunion, but Faraday — the guy that's actually gonna save us — is being death marched into the jungle right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Good luck with that.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: You're not gonna help me save him?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: No. I'm gonna go down and finish my conversation with Richard.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: That's gonna get us all killed. You go rolling in there, they're gonna know we're here.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Fair enough. I'll give you ten minutes head start.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: What about you? You wanna stay here in Crazytown or help me rescue the geek?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: Why do you keep looking at me?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: No, no, I'm—I'm not. I—
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: You are.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: You know what? You're right. I'm—I'm sorry. It's just... you look so much like... someone I used to know.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: Someone other than the girl you just professed your love for? Well, aren't you the Romeo.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Far from it, believe me.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: I don't believe you, by the way. You may have Richard fooled, you can't really expect me to believe that you, a British woman and a Chinese man are all members of the United States military. Who are you and what are you doing on our island?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: You wanna know who I am?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: I'm your best chance at disarming that bomb.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: Right, then, disarm it.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: What are you doing up there?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: I'm examining it.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Back up.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Get back, get back. It's unsafe. We need to move.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: I swear, if you try anything...
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: If I try anything—what, you're gonna—you're gonna shoot me? Is that right? Yeah, that would be perfect because, of course, rifle fire right next to—what would you call this—hydrogen bomb? Yes, fantastic idea. Really... inspired. Okay, listen to me. Do you people have any access to lead or concrete?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: For what?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: There's a crack in the casing. It needs to be filled with lead. You need to take it off this platform carefully and bury it.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: You brought me all the way out here to tell us that we have to bury it? You told Alpert you could disarm that thing.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: You don't need to worry. You do what I say, you bury it, it won't go off.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: How do you know that?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: I need you to trust me.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: I don't trust you.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Just bury it. Bury it, and everything will be fine. Remember, your superior ordered me to take care of this.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: How can you be so sure?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: You wanna take care of this bomb?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: How?!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: You bury it!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: How do you know that?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Because 50 years from now, this island is still here!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: There you— 
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE: What did you just say?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Whoa. Take it easy. I can explain myself a little better. I know how this sounds. Believe me, it's... oh, it's hard to explain. 50 years from now, me and my... me and my friends—that's where we're from, okay? And—here's the key—everything's fine. I'm not saying it's perfectly fine, but there hasn't been any atomic blast, all right? There has not—
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: Drop the gun, Blondie.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: It's okay. She's okay. You can put your gun down.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: She puts hers down first.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: Why don't we all put our guns down?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: I said, drop it!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER:  Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 ELLIE:  Are they from the future, too?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: You told her?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MELANIE:  Sir! Sir, you can't—
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MELANIE: Mr. Widmore. I'm so sorry. He charged right past me.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 WIDMORE: That's all right, Melanie. Mr. Hume is a... colleague of mine.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 WIDMORE: Please leave us.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: I know you have questions for me. I'm not gonna answer them. I've come here to ask you something. And once you've told me everything I need to know, you'll never see me again. Understand?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 WIDMORE: All right.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: I need to know where I can find Daniel Faraday's mother.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 WIDMORE: What makes you think I would even know the answer to that?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Because even before you put Faraday on your little boat and sent him off to the Island, you spent ten years funding his research. So I figure, you must know something regarding his next of kin.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 WIDMORE: Desmond, I haven't seen or heard from my daughter for three years. Just answer me this. Is she safe?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Where's Faraday's mother?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 WIDMORE:  She's in Los Angeles. This is an address for her.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 WIDMORE: I suspect she won't be pleased to see you. She's a very private person.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 WIDMORE: Wait, Desmond.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 WIDMORE: Deliver your message... but then get out of this mess. Don't put Penny's life in danger.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Danger?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 WIDMORE: You're getting yourself involved in something that goes back many, many years. It has nothing to do with you or my daughter. Wherever you were hiding...  go back there.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND:  Thanks for the advice.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Richard Alpert!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JONES: Hey. Hey!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE:  I'm looking for Richard.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JONES: Don't move.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Richard Alpert!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JONES: On the ground now.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Richard, I need to talk to you!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JONES: Shut—your—mouth!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: That's enough! Who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE:  My name is John Locke.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: Is that supposed to mean something to me?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Jacob sent me.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD:  Put the gun down.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JONES: What? Richard, you can't seriously trust him.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: I said... put the gun down, Widmore.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE:  Your name is Widmore? Charles Widmore?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 WIDMORE: What's it to you?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Nothing. Nice to meet you.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: ...and the fishy suddenly peeked out, but it saw the bear so that it ran away again.  Where—?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND:  Hi.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY:  Hi.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Good day?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: Yeah. He wanted to go fishing in the Thames. We were unsuccessful. And you? Did you find Faraday's mum?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Ugh. There was no one to find. She, um... she died a few years ago.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: Why are you lying to me?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND:  What? I'm not.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: Where is she?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND:  She's in Los Angeles.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Look, Pen, you've got nothing to worry about. You know, this was a mistake. No, I... I made a promise that this would be done in a day, and now it's done. It's not our problem anymore.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY:  And what happens if you wake up tomorrow and remember something else?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: Then I'll forget it.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY: And the next day?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 DESMOND: I'll forget it. It doesn't matter, Pen. You're my life now—you and Charlie. I won't leave you again... not for this... not for anything.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 PENNY:  You'll never forget it, Des. So I guess we're going with you.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: I gave you this?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: After you were shot in the leg and I... wandered out of the jungle to patch you up?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: That's right.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: Then why don't I remember... well, any of this?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Because it hasn't happened yet.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD:  I'm not sure what you're expecting me to say, John Locke.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: I expect you to tell me how to get off the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: That's very privileged information. Why would I share it with you?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Because you told me that I had something very important to do once I get there. And because I'm your leader.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: You're my leader?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: That's what you told me.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: Look, I... certainly don't want to contradict myself, but... we have a very specific process for selecting our leadership, and it starts at a v—very, very young age.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: All right. All right. What year is it right now?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: It's 1954.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: All right. May 30, 1956—2 years from now—that's the day I'm born—Tustin, California, and if you don't believe me, I suggest you come and visit me.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: Oh, no.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 RICHARD: What's wrong?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 LOCKE: It's about to happen again. You need to tell me now, Richard. How do I get off the Island? Please! Tell me!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 SAWYER: You all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 JULIET: Yeah. I think so.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Charlotte!
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: You okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CHARLOTTE: Yeah, I'm fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 MILES: Yeah, me, too. I'm great, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 CHARLOTTE: Ahh.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Charlotte.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte! No, no, no. Look it. Hey. Look at me, look at me.
Lost.Season05.Episode03 FARADAY: It's okay. It's okay. Charlotte!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK:  Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Oh, you don't have to whisper. When he's out, he's out.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK:  At least one of us can sleep.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: It's gonna take more than two nights for me to get used to sleeping in a normal bed. What are we gonna do about him? About Aaron.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: I've been thinking a lot about him. Did you know that Claire was flying to L.A. to give him up for adoption?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: No. No, I didn't.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: I think we should say he's mine.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: We could say that I was six months pregnant when I was arrested and that I gave birth to him on the Island. No one would ever know.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Kate, no. You don't have to...  There's other ways to вo this.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: After everyone we've lost—Michael, Jin, Sawyer... I can't lose him, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Sawyer's not dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: No. But he's gone. Good night, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Kate... If we're gonna be safe, if we're gonna protect the people that we left behind, tomorrow morning, I'm gonna have to convince everyone to lie. If it's just me, they're never gonna go for it. So I'm gonna turn to you first. Are you with me?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: I have always been with you.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SUN: How does it fit?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: It's perfect. Thank you for the loaner.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SUN: Looks great on you.  Are you sure you want to do this?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE:  It was your idea.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 AARON: Mommy!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Aaron, honey, mommy's gonna run out and do an errand. I'll be right back. Okay? And then we can go home.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SUN: Don't worry about us, Kate. There's candy in the minibar and a hundred channels on TV. We're going to be just fine here.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Sun... I don't know what I would've done if you weren't here. Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SUN: It's what any friend would do.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Okay, well, I will be back soon. Okay, you be good for Sun. Okay, honey?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SUN: Good luck.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MAN: Delivery for you, Ms. Kwon.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SUN: Thank you. Thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SUN: I'll be right back, honey.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: Charlotte? Charlotte?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: What the hell's wrong with her? She's been out for 10 minutes.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: Stop shouting, James.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: Hey, man.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: If there's something that you want to tell me, Daniel, now would be a good time.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: I'm not sure what you mean exactly.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: She's asking if you know why your girlfriend had a seizure.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: Give us some space, would you?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: She's like this 'cause the sky keeps lighting up. He knew this would happen and he didn't say squat about it.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: James... go away.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: Did you know that this would happen?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: I thought... I thought it might. I think it's neurological. Our brains have an internal clock, a sense of time. The flashes... throw the clock off. It's like really bad jet lag.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: Really bad jet lag doesn't make you hemorrhage, Daniel. You wanna tell me why it isn't happening to the rest of us?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: I don't know. But thank God it's not.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NORTON: Thank you for waiting. Did my assistant offer you something to drink?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Um, yes. I'm fine, thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NORTON: Good. Please, Ms. Austen, sit.  So... how can I help you?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Uh...  Mr. Norton, when you came to my house looking for blood samples from me and my son, I asked you who your client was...
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NORTON: And I said I couldn't tell you.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Yeah. I'm here to offer you a deal. I'll give you the blood samples, but first, I wanna talk to your client. Considering what you're asking for, that's more than reasonable.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NORTON: Well, I am, uh, seeing my client later today, and I will be sure to pass along your offer. But I am pretty sure of what the answer's gonna be—no. And the reason, of course, is that you're in no position to be making any kind of deals, and we both know it. I have a signed court order compelling you to let us confirm that you're the child's mother. I could send the sheriff over there today and make you do it, but my client insists that we... handle the exchange of custody quietly.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: What do you mean "exchange of custody"?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NORTON: You know exactly what I mean.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: No, I... Mr. Norton, I just wanna know who is doing this to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NORTON: You did this to yourself. Now it is time you prepare yourself, Ms. Austen. You are going to lose the boy.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: We have to go back to the Orchid.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: The Orchid. That's where all this started. Maybe it's where it'll all stop.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: That greenhouse is a long ways away.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: You said you had a Zodiac raft back at the beach. We could take that, cut around the horn of the Island, be at the Orchid in half the time.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: And let me guess. You know exactly what to do when we get there.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: No, not exactly at all, but I know that Ben used it to leave the Island. And if I can do the same thing, I believe I can save us.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: And how you gonna do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: This is all happening because they left. I think it'll stop if I can bring them back.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Bring who back?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: Jack, Sun, Sayid, Hugo, Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: The boat blew up, and that chopper was probably on it.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: They're not dead, James.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Says who?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: That doesn't matter. All that matters is they've gotta come back. I have to make them come back... even if it kills me. Don't you want 'em to come back, James? Don't you want her to come back?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: It doesn't matter what I want.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: Hey! She's waking up!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: Are you okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: Who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: It's me. It's Daniel.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: Daniel.  Oh, my head.  What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: There was another flash. You passed out. How do you feel?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: A bit dizzy, but... I'm fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: Good.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES:  Hooray. Everything's back to normal. Now what?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: I'll tell you "now what". We're going to the Orchid.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Dilation's almost back to normal.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAYID: Good. Now take this IV out of my arm, and let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Sayid, you were unconscious for 42 hours. You had the equivalent of three doses of horse tranquilizer in your system.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAYID: If you sent that man to Hurley's house, we have to leave now.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: You need to relax. Ben is not gonna hurt Hurley. Ben is on our side.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAYID: The only side he's on is his own.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 DR. ARIZA: Dr. Shephard? I'm Dr. Ariza, director of clinical services. A word with you, please?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: I'll be right back.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 DR. ARIZA: What do you think you are doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: I was treating a patient. I apologize. It was an emergency. I know that—
Lost.Season05.Episode04 DR. ARIZA: You were suspended on charges of substance abuse. Emergency or not, Dr. Shephard, you have no business being here.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: I understand, and I take full responsibility for my actions.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 DR. ARIZA: No, Doctor. The hospital takes full responsibility for your actions, and that makes us liable for them.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Excuse me.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Hello?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 HURLEY: Jack? It's me.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Hurley.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 HURLEY: Hey, did Sayid get to you? Did my dad drop him off?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Yes. He did. Hurley, where are—
Lost.Season05.Episode04 HURLEY: Is he okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: He's fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 HURLEY: Awesome.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Hurley, where are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, I'm totally cool. I'm in L.A. County lockup. Oh, and tell Sayid I did exactly what he said. I'm totally safe. Ben's never gonna get me now. Thanks, dude.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: What are you talking about, Hurley? Wait! Wait—
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: Good. You're here. How's Sayid?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NURSE: How you doing today, sir?  Got your meds for you.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAYID: Sorry, I think you have the wrong room.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NURSE: Nope. Room 133, right? Got the orders right here. But don't worry. I won't have to give you an injection. Put this right in your IV line.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAYID: Who are you? Who are you working for?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NURSE: 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAYID: Okay, talk, talk.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NURSE: Address — it's in my pocket.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: Hello, Sayid.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAYID: Do we know anyone who lives at 42 Panorama Crest?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: That's Kate's address.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Hello?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Kate? It's Jack. Are you okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Yeah. I'm fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Where are you right now? Are you at home?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Uh... what?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Listen, I'll explain everything once you're out, but you've gotta get Aaron—
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Look, I'm not at home, okay? I'm... Aaron is at a hotel with Sun.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Sun? Sun's in L.A.?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Yeah, she's here on business.  Listen. Jack, this is really not a good time. I'm so sorry that I even picked up the phone. I'm not—
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Kate, do not hang up on me. Please listen. Listen, uh ... will you tell me where you are? I need to see you.  Kate, please.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: I'm downtown. Wilshire and Olive.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Okay. All right. I'm on my way.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: She's not at home, but I'm gonna go to her right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: Good. I'll go deal with Hugo.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAYID: Sorry, Ben. I'm not letting you get anywhere near him.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: You have friends in trouble. Let's get them to safety and save the dirty linen for later.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAYID: I'll drive.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: After you get Kate, meet us at the Long Beach Marina, slip 23. And, Jack — hurry. We're running out of time.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Hey, Locke? What are you gonna say to her?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: Sorry?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Kate. What are you gonna say to her to get her to come back?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: I haven't figured that out yet.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Well, let me tell you something. She was pretty excited to hop on that chopper and get the hell out of here.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: What the hell is that?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: Whatever it is, we better stay clear of it.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Beach is this way. Now you wanna take the scenic route?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: John... do you know when we are?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: We need to keep moving.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: Hey. How's your headache?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: Better. Nothing like sore feet to take your mind off your head, eh?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY:  Well, don't worry. Once we get to the beach, we're gonna take the Zodiac around the other side of the island and you can rest.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: You're sweet, but you don't need to baby me. I'm fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: You okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: I'm peachy.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Shh!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: Now what?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER:  Nobody move.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE:  James!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: I got this.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CLAIRE: It knows I don't want it, and I was gonna give it away. Babies know that stuff.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Okay, no, no, hang on. Listen, listen. Do you want this baby? Do you want it to be safe and healthy?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: You're not alone in this. We are all here for you. This baby is all of ours. But I need you to push. Okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: One, two, three... push! Push!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Come on, Claire! Push!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CLAIRE:  Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Okay! He's coming!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Push! Push! Push! Push!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Push! Push! Push! Push!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: James? What happened? Did you see something out here, James?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Don't matter. It's gone now.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: You shaved your beard.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Yeah. Just needed a change.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Look, Jack, uh... I don't know why you called, but I can't be dealing with this right now. I...
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: What's going on?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Nothing. Just... can you just go?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Why don't you just tell me?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Jack, please, just go.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Kate, please, tell me.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE:  Somebody wants Aaron.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: There's a lawyer in there. His clients — they know we're lying. They know I'm not his mom, and they're gonna take him away.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Who's gonna take him away?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: What—what are you doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Look, I gotta go, all right? Get in or don't.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: Hey. You ready to tell me who you saw back there?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: I already told you. It was nothin'.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: You and I both know when we were before the flash, James. So who was it you saw? Charlie? Shannon? Yourself?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: And how is it that you knew when we were, Johnny Boy? That light in the sky — it was from the Hatch, wasn't it?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: The night that Boone died... I went out there and started pounding on it as hard as I could. I was... confused... scared. Babbling like an idiot, asking, why was all this happening to me?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Did you get an answer?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: Light came on, shot up into the sky. At the time, I thought it meant something.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Did it?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: No. It was just a light.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: So why'd you turn us around then? Don't you wanna go back there?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: Why would I wanna do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: So you could tell yourself to do things different, save yourself a world of pain.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: No, I needed that pain — to get to where I am now.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: Hey.  I just got a nosebleed.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: What? When?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: Let's just not freak out the others, okay? Just tell me... why—why her? Why me?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: I don't know. Uh, I think it might have something to do with duration of exposure. You know, the amount of time you've spent on the island.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: Doesn't make any sense. Those yahoos have been here for months. I've never been here before two weeks ago.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: Are you sure about that?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Hello?!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: The camp's back.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Finally. Anybody for a DHARMA beer? Hello? Anybody here? Rose? Bernard?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: I wonder how long ago this happened.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Son of a bitch!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: What is it?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: It's Vincent's.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Yeah? Well, where's the rest of the dog? Where's the rest of our people?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: The Zodiac's gone, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: Maybe your people took the boat.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Why the hell would they do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: To get away from whoever came in those.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: Where did these come from?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: That's a good question. They're pretty old.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: Not that old. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Let me see that. "Adg-eh-ruh"?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: Ajira. It's an airline. It's based out of India, but they fly everywhere.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Great. Maybe they got a flight out of here to Vegas tonight.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Who came in these? Other Others?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: Don't look at me.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: My question is, when are they coming back?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: Let's not wait to find out.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: This plan sounded a hell of a lot better when we were going by motorboat.  How far is this place?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: It's around that point. Not more than a couple hours.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES:  Oh, joy.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET:  You all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: I saw Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Last night, in the jungle. Before the last flash. She was delivering Claire's baby.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: But that was two months ago.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Time travel's a bitch.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: Get down!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Paddle!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: I think they want their boat back!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: Move!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: These your people?!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: No! Are they yours?!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Shut up and keep paddling!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Little help! Little help!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: Paddle harder! They're getting closer!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER:  Thank you, Lord!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: I take that back!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: Everybody, paddle! Head for the shore!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Kate, just because the guy told you that he was meeting his client doesn't mean that they're here in L.A. He could've just told you that to—to throw you off.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Or they're in that hotel right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Okay. And what if they are? What if the person who wants to take Aaron is sitting in that hotel room right now? Then what? Come on. Come with me. We'll—we'll go get Aaron, we'll put our heads together, and we'll figure something out.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: All right.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Oh my god.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK:  It's Claire's mother.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Wait.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: What am I waiting for, Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Wait. I just... let's just think about this for a minute.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: She knows.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Maybe she doesn't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: No, but she knows about Aaron, and that's all that matters!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK:  Let me go talk to her.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: If I can just explain to her why we did it — maybe if I can get her to understand why... she'll listen to me. I can fix this, Kate. I can fix it. Hey... Aaron is my family too.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CAROLE: Dr. Shephard?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Hello, Ms. Littleton. Um... may I come in?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CAROLE: Of course.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CAROLE: You look drenched.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: No, no. No, I'm fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CAROLE: God, I haven't seen you since your father's funeral. How did you even know I was here?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Uh... I knew you were here, Ms. Littleton, because I followed your lawyer.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CAROLE: Why would you do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: I'm — I did it because, um... I understand that you feel the need to do this. But I need you to know that everything that Kate and I have done—it was for Aaron.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CAROLE: Who's... Aaron? I—I'm afraid I'm not following you.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Ms. Littleton, um... what are you doing here in Los Angeles?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Let's go. Drive. Then call Sun and tell her to bring Aaron to the Long Beach Marina. We'll meet her there.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: What—wh-what are you talking about? What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Kate, we have to go now.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what just happened!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: She doesn't know anything.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: She doesn't know. She still thinks that Claire is dead.  She doesn't even know that Aaron exists.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: But the lawyer—
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: She sued Oceanic, and she's in town to pick up her settlement.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: What, and it's just a coincidence that her lawyer happens to be the same one that's trying to take my son?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: I don't know. But whoever's trying to take Aaron... it's not her.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Then who is it?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: Can I ask you something? Why'd you take it upon yourself to rescue Hugo?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAYID: I had to make sure Hurley was safe.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: You can pull in over here.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NORTON: Mr. Linus.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: Mr. Norton.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NORTON: I looked into it, and they don't have any kind of solid case against Reyes. The M.E. said that the man found outside Santa Rosa was killed before Reyes escaped.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: That's very good news.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NORTON: We have a prelim hearing in the morning. The judge will never let it get past that, and Reyes will be a free man.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: Thank you, Dan.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 NORTON: Anytime.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAYID: Who was that?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: That's my lawyer.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: Aah! Okay!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MILES: Remind me never to do that again.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 FARADAY: Where are we?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: It's hard to say til it gets light.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: What conversation was that?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: The one before they started shooting at us, where you were about to tell me how it felt to see Kate again.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: I wasn't about to tell you anything.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: Why don't you tell me now?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: I was close enough to touch her. If I wanted to, I could've... stood right up and talked to her.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: Why didn't you?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 SAWYER: What's done is done... Juliet?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JULIET: What's wrong?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: Oi! Come and look at this!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 CHARLOTTE: It's wreckage. Looks like it just happened.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 LOCKE: Anybody speak French?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 ROBERT: Mais j'te l'ai dit, on aurait jamais dû suivre ces maudits chiffres ! 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MONTAND: Mais c'est pas ma faute, Robert. C'est Brennan qui devait tenir le sonar ! 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BRENNAN: Mais je le faisais, Montand! Je vous l'ai déja dit, les instruments ont mal fonctionné ! 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN: Un homme à la mer ! 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 ROBERT: Quoi? 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BRENNAN: Mais je pensais qu'on était tous là ! 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MONTAND: On est tous là ! Il n'est pas des nôtres. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BRENNAN: Alors qui est-ce? 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 ROBERT: Pagaie!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MONTAND: Pagayez! Allez! 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 UNKNOWN: Pointez la lampe de poche sur lui. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN: Il faut tenir la lampe torche. Brennan, aide-les à pagayer. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 UNKNOWN: Allez! Dépêchez-vous ! Nous dérivons avec le courant. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 UNKNOWN: Non, y'a que lui ! Pas de bateau, rien. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 UNKNOWN: Les vagues vont nous amener jusque sur la côte. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 UNKNOWN: Le vent va passer par ici. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN: Au nom de dieu, Brennan ! Ta gueule ! 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 UNKNOWN: Allez, tirez-le dans le radeau. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 UNKNOWN: Aide moi. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 UNKNOWN: Il est lourd ! 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 UNKNOWN: Tiens, il respire encore. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Jack, why did you call me today?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: I told you. I was... I was worried.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: But why? Why were you worried? Why today?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: I don't...
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: Right before I called you, Sayid was attacked. And the guy that did it—your address was in his pocket.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Sayid? What's he doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: That's not important right now. What matters is that we get you and Aaron someplace safe.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Safe from who?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: Hello, Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: It's okay. He's with me.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: He's with you?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: I know this is gonna be hard to understand, but he's here to help us. To help everyone that we left behind. We all need to be together again.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: It's him.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: It's him. He's the one who's trying to take Aaron.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JACK: No. No. You—you don't understand.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: No, Jack. She's right. It was me. Sorry.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 KATE: Who the hell do you think you are? Why don't you just stay away?! Why don't you leave me and my son alone?!
Lost.Season05.Episode04 BEN: Because he's not your son, Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 AUTOMATED VOICE OVER RADIO: 4... 8...
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MONTAND: Robert... Regarde, le signal vient de l'île. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 ROBERT: Tu peux déterminer la source ? 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 AUTOMATED VOICE OVER RADIO: 15... 16...
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MONTAND: Bien sûr que oui. Regarde. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 ROBERT: Tu crois que l'île est habitée ? 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MONTAND: J'sais pas. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN:  Ça va ? Comment tu te sens ? 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JIN: No understand.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN:  You speak English?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JIN:  Little.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN: Are you okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JIN: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN: How did you get here?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JIN: Boat.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 ROBERT: Qui est-ce ? 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MONTAND: On s'en fout qui c'est. Qu'est ce qu'il fait ici ? 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN: Il dit qu'il est venu en bateau. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 ROBERT:  What boat?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JIN: It's gone. Sink.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN: It must've been caught in the same storm as ours.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MONTAND:  Who are you? How long you in the water?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JIN: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 MONTAND: How do you not know how you wound up in the middle of the ocean, huh?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN: Montand ! Laisse-le, il est en état de choc. On a de l’eau à lui donner ? 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 ROBERT: Ouais. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 ROBERT: Tiens. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN: Merci, Robert. 
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JIN:  Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN: What is your name?
Lost.Season05.Episode04 JIN: Kwon Jin-soo. Jin.
Lost.Season05.Episode04 YOUNG WOMAN: Hello, Jin. I'm Danielle. Danielle Rousseau.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: 여보세요? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MRS. PAIK: 선? 어디냐? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: 저 아직 LA에 있어요. 일 마무리 하면 내일 비행기 탈 거예요. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MRS. PAIK: 지연이가 통화하고 싶어해. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JI YEON: 엄마. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: 어, 우리 이쁜 딸, 잘 지내지? 엄마가 미국에서 지연이한테 소개해주고 싶은 친구를 만났어. 이름은 애런이야. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JI YEON: 엄마 보고 싶어. 언제 와? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: 엄마 빨리 갈게. 그래, 사랑해. 안녕. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 KATE: Why don't you leave me and my son alone?!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: Because he's not your son, Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: Move away, Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JACK: Sun—
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: I said, move away!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 KATE: S-Sun! What are you doing? Where's Aaron?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: He's in the car.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JACK: Sun, listen. I know you think you're helping—
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN:  If it wasn't for you, Jin would still be alive.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: I didn't kill your husband, Sun.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: Yes, you did.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: No, I didn't. Neither did anyone else, because he's not dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: You're lying.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: No, Sun. Jin's still alive, and I can prove it.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MAN ON RECORDING: 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. 8, 15...
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Are you all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: You Rousseau? Danielle Rousseau?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Yes. Th-that's right.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: Where you from?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: We sailed from Tahiti.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: When?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: November 15th.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: No. What year?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: 1988. Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: What's the matter?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: I... I—I need go find my camp.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU:  W—what camp?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: You were on this island before?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: You see helicopter?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MONTAND: D'abord un bateau, ensuite un hélicoptère. Bientôt il va nous parler d'un sous-marin. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MONTAND: Allez, j'sais par où passer. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: T'es sûr ? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MONTAND: Ecoute, le signal est puissant. Ce qui veut dire qu'il y a sûrement une antenne sur cette île. Si on la trouve, on pourra appeler du secours. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT:  Is there an antenna on the Island?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Hey, Jin! Is—uh, please. Is there, um... ra—a radio tower?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Um... um... okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Like that. Is there a-a radio tower here?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: Yes. But I—I must find my camp because maybe, uh, helicopter go there.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Do you know where your camp is from here?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN:  No.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: How about from the radio tower?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Then go with us to the tower. Then we'll find your camp.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Bon, c'est décidé. On bouge de là. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Are you ready to go?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Who are you hoping to find?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: My wife.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MAN ON RECORDING: 8, 15, 16, 23...  23...
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MONTAND:  Par là. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Ugh!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Danielle ? Qu'est qu'il y a ? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Rien, c'est rien. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Je savais que c'était une erreur, t'es enceinte de sept mois— 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Robert, ça va! Elle m'a juste donné un petit coup de pied. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Elle ? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Elle ! 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Arrête ! Combien de fois on va remettre ça ? Alexandre, c'est un garçon. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Alexandra. Ca va être une fille. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Unh-unh.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Si.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: On se repose un moment ? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU: Ouais. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Je vais te chercher de l'eau. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Brennan ? T'as l'eau ? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BRENNAN: Nadine a un gourde. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT:  Nadine?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BRENNAN: Nadine? Nadine!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MONTAND: Voilà ce qui arrive quand on amène des femmes. Elle court sûrement après un papillon, quoi. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROUSSEAU:  Did you hear that?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: What is that?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: Monster.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIELLE: Qui est le dernier à voir Nadine? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BRENNAN: Elle était juste derrière moi. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIELLE: Okay, on fait le demi tour.   We go find her.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: No! We must go!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MONTAND:  You shut up.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MONTAND: Allez. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 VARIOUS: Nadine!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BRENNAN: Qu'est-ce qu'il y a par terre là? C'est son sac à dos! 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 VARIOUS: Nadine!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Okay, on sépare et on la cherche. Elle doit pas être bien loin. Brennan, LaCombe, par ici. Moi je vais aller par là. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIELLE: Nadine!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: Run!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIELLE: Prenez-le! Saisissez-le! 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Vite! 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: What was that thing?!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MONTAND:  Aidez-moi! Ahh, aidez-moi j'suis blessé! C'est parti, je vous en prie!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Qu'on aille là-dedans. On le sort de là. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN:  No!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: We do not leave anyone behind.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: On y va. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: No, you don't go in with baby. No.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIELLE: What's wrong? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIELLE: Laisse-la! Pose-la! Pose ton arme! 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Danielle, fais pas ça, c'est moi! 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIELLE: T'es pas Robert! T'es changé! Cette machine t'as changé! 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Danielle, je t'en prie. Pose ton arme. Je t'aime, pourquoi tu agis comme ça? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIELLE: Parce que t'es pas Robert. T'es malade. Ce monstre t'a rendu malade. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Mais il n'y a pas de monstre. C'est un système de sécurité qui garde ce temple, c'est tout. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Maintenant, pose ton fusil. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ROBERT: Je t'aime, Danielle. Je ne veux que rien nous arrive. A toi, et à notre bébé. Je t'en supplie, fais pas ça. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: No!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIELLE: You! You disappeared! Are you sick too? You're a carrier?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: No! No, please, wait!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MAN'S VOICE: Turn around slowly.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: Jin?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: Sawyer?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: I thought you were on that boat, I thought you were dead!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: No, no, I... in water.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: Well what do you say!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: Where is Sun?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MILES:  Where'd that guy come from? I thought he was on the boat.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL:  The blast must've thrown him in the water. He's been moving with every flash, just like us.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER:  Every time the sky lights up, we... move through time.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN:  무슨 말을 하는지 도대체 모르겠어.  Translate. Please, translate.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER:  You heard the man, translate.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MILES: Uh, he's Korean. I'm from Encino.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN:  선이 이 섬에 없다는 것을 로크가 어떻게 알아?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE:  He wants to know how you're sure his wife is off the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: You speak Korean, Red?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MILES: Obviously.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: Tell him I'm sure. But none of it will matter if we don't make it to the Orchid.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE:  확실해. 그리고 오키드까지 가야 한대. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: 오키드가 뭔데? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: 섬을 벗어나는 법. 로크는 여길 벗어나 당신 친구들 모두 데려 온대. 당신 와이프도. 그래야만 플래쉬를 막을 수 있대요. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN:  Bring Sun back? Why you bring her back?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: Because she never should've left.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: I've spent the last 3 years thinking... believing that he was dead. You say you have proof that he's not. I want to see it.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: Why don't you put down the gun. No one wants it to go off.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: How do you know he's alive?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: There's someone—someone here in Los Angeles. Let me take you to them, and I'll show you the proof.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: Someone? Who?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: The same person that's going to show us how to get back to the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 KATE:  Is that what this is about? You knew about this?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JACK: No, no, I was...
Lost.Season05.Episode05 KATE: And that is why you're pretending to care about Aaron, to convince me to go back there?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JACK: I wasn't pretending anything...
Lost.Season05.Episode05 KATE: This is insane, you guys are crazy.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JACK: Kate...
Lost.Season05.Episode05 KATE: Jack, don't! 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: Sayid, where are you going?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAYID: I don't want any part of this. And if I see you, or him again, it will be extremely unpleasant for all of us. 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: 30 minutes, Sun. We can be there in 30 minutes. And you’ll have proof—proof that he's alive. Or you can shoot me and never know.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: Let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN:  How far?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: Just over the next ridge.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: How you will leave the Island?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: I'm not sure yet.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: I'll go with you.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: It doesn't work like that. It's a one man job.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: I don’t know why, Jin, it just is. But I promise I'll bring Sun back.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL:  You okay? Want to take a break?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: Let's just get there.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: So... you speak any other languages?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: Just Klingon. Dan, is this gonna work?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: It... it does make empirical sense that if this started at the Orchid then that's where it's gotta stop. But as far as bringing back the people who left in order to stop these temporal shifts? That's where we leave science behind.  You okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: Oh no!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: Come on!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE:  Ah!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: Charlotte! Charlotte!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER:  Juliet...?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JULIET:  Huh?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: ...you have a little... 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JULIET: You too.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: Charlotte! Can you hear me? Charlotte, it's Daniel. Talk to me...
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE:  데려 오지 말라고 해. 잘 들어. 데려 오지 말라고 해. 이 곳은 죽음 뿐이야.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: What'd she say?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE:  Don't let them bring her back. No matter what—don't let them bring her back! This place is death!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: You said we'd be there in 30 minutes.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN:  I didn't account for traffic.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JACK: Sun, I'm sorry.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN:  Sorry for what?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JACK: For leaving Jin behind. When we landed that chopper on the boat, everything was just happening so fast. I knew he was down below. I should've waited for him.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: Why are you telling me this now, Jack? Are you going to ask me not to kill Ben if he's lying about my husband?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JACK: After what he just did to Kate - if you don't do it, Sun, I will.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JACK: What are you doing?!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN:  What I'm doing is helping you! And if you had any idea what I've had to do to keep you safe – to keep your friends safe – then you'd never stop thanking me! You wanna shoot me, then shoot me – but let's get on with it! What's it gonna be?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN:  Drive.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE:  Why can't Daddy come with us?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: Charlotte, can you hear me?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE:  You know what my mum would say about you marrying an American.  I know more about ancient Carthage than Hannibal himself.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: What the hell is she talking about?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: I have no idea.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: Let's go – we have to keep moving.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: Alright. Somebody help me with Charlotte. We're going to have to carry her.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: No – she's going to hold us up.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: We can't just leave her.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: Flashes are getting closer together. Maybe when your nose starts bleeding, you'll realize we gotta get out of Dodge now. We'll come back for her just as soon as we can.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: No. No way. I'm not going to leave her behind.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: Let them go without me.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: No, Charlotte, no, we're not going to leave you behind.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: Hell!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: We have to move, now!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: He's right, go!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: Charlotte...
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: Just go!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: Charlotte...
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: Oh, oh turn it up! I love Geronimo Jackson.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JULIET:  We're running out of time, Dan.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: Go. I'm going to stay with her.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: Let me ask you something, John. If we don't even know when the hell we are, what happens if the Orchid ain't around anymore?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE:  Look for the well. You'll find it at the well.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER:  I'll be sure and do that.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: Let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: We're here.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JULIET: Thank God! What are the odds that we would end up in the same time as this thing?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: You just had to say something.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MILES: How the hell did Charlotte know this was here?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE:  Daniel?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: Yes?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: I've been here before.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: You've been...been here before?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: I grew up here...on the island. And there was this thing...this... DHARMA Initiative. And then...I moved away with my mum. Just my mum...and...I never saw my dad again. And then when I got back to England, I would...I would...ask my mum about this place, yeah? But she would say that it wasn't real...and that I'd made it up. That's why... I became an anthropologist. To find this island again. It's what...I've been searching for my whole life.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: Charlotte...why are you telling me this?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: Because I remember something now. When I was little, living here, there was this man... a crazy man, he really scared me. And he told me that I had to leave the island and never ever come back. He told me that if I came back I would die.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: Charlotte, I don't understand.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: Daniel – I think that man was you.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER:  You're going down there?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: Uh-huh.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: What exactly are you hoping to find?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: A way off the island.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: You expecting a subway?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: Goodbye, James, Juliet, Miles... I'll see you when I get back.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: No! Stop! You don't bring Sun back.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: No, I have to bring them all back, that's... that's how it works.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN:  How you know?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: I... I just know.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN:  I cut this!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: No! You do that, you'll kill every one of us!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: This island is bad! You don't bring Sun back! You promise—you promise you don't bring my baby!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: All right, all right—you have my word.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN: Promise, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE:  I promise.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: I won't go to Sun, Jin, but she might find me. If she does, what do I tell her?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JIN:  You tell her I dead. You say I wash up. You bury me.  Proof.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE:  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: You sure you don't want us to lower you down?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: Where would be the fun in that? 
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JULIET: John, if whatever you're attempting to do actually works... thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: You're welcome.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MILES: Uh-oh.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: John, dammit, hold on!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MILES:  I think you can let go of that now.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: No... no no, no no!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JULIET:  James, stop.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER: No, no!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JULIET: James, stop.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SAWYER:  C'mon and help me!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JULIET:  James—we can't help him.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: Hold on... hold on... hold on... hold on... stay.... stay... stay with me... stay, okay? You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be okay. I've got a plan... I've got a plan. When we were back at the hatch, I talked to Desmond. I told him to find my mother. She can help us, Charlotte, she will help us!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: How can your mother help us?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: She can! She will...
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE: Hey, hey. Listen, listen.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL: Yeah? What?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHARLOTTE:  I'm not allowed to have chocolate before dinner... mm....
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DANIEL:  Charlotte. Charlotte? Charlotte... No...!
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE:  James! Can you hear me? Can anyone hear me?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: Who's there?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD: Hello, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE:  You! What are you doing down here?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHRISTIAN: I'm here to help you the rest of the way.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: I... I don't understand.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHRISTIAN: You came to see me in the cabin. You asked me how to save the island and I told you you had to move it. I said that you had to move it, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: But Ben said he knew how to do it! He told me that I had to stay here and lead his people.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHRISTIAN: Since when did listening to him get you anywhere worth a damn? The good news is that you're here now. You ready to go?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: I don't... I don't... I... I don't know... what to do once I get there.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHRISTIAN: There's a woman living in Los Angeles. Now once you get all your friends together—and it must be all of them, every one who left—and once you've persuaded 
them to join you, this woman will tell you exactly how to come back.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: Who is she?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHRISTIAN: Her name is Eloise Hawking.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: What if I can only convince some of them to come back?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHRISTIAN: I believe in you, John. You can do this.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: Richard said I was going to die.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHRISTIAN: Well, I suppose that's why they call it sacrifice.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE: All right. I'm ready.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHRISTIAN: Good. Now, on the other side of this column here is a wheel, slipped off its axis. All you have to do is give it a little push.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE:  Could you help me up?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHRISTIAN:  No. Sorry. I can't.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHRISTIAN: Good luck John.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 CHRISTIAN: Say hello to my son.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 LOCKE:  Who's your son?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: May I?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: Take it.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: 영원히 함께 하길.   How do you have this?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: John gave it to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 JACK:  You said John never came to see you.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: That's true, Jack. I went to see him.  Jin gave it to him before he left the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN: Why did he not tell me himself?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: I don't know. Maybe he never had a chance before he died. I'm sorry I had to bring you here before I gave it to you, Sun. But all those people back on the Island—Jin included—need our help. There is a woman in this church and she can tell us how to get back to your husband. But we're running out of time, Sun. So I need you to decide right now. Will you come with me?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 SUN:  Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 MAN'S VOICE: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: I assume the same thing you are.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 DESMOND: You're looking for Faraday's mother too?
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: Hello, Eloise.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ELOISE: Hello, Benjamin.  I thought I said all of them.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 BEN: This is all I could get on short notice.
Lost.Season05.Episode05 ELOISE:  Well, I suppose it will have to do for now. All right! Let's get started.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY:  Help! Anyone!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Help, Jack!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Help! Anyone!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Help!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Help!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Help!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Help!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: It's okay. You're okay. Relax.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Aah! Oh, God! Oh, God!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Oh, my God!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: We can stand.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: We can stand.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Oh. Oh, my God. It really happened.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Kate.  Kate. Kate, can you hear me?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE:  Oh. Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Are you okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: Are we...
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Yeah. We're back.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: I thought I said all of them.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: This is all I could get on short notice.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: Guess it'll have to do for now. All right. Let's get started.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: Shall we?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: What is this place?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: The DHARMA Initiative called it the Lamp Post. This is how they found the island.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  Did you know about this place?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: No. No, I didn't.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  Is he telling the truth?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE:  Probably not.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: Aha. Here we go.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE:  All right. I apologize if this is confusing, but...  Let's pay attention, yes? The room we're standing in was constructed years ago over a unique pocket of electromagnetic energy. That energy connects to similar pockets all over the world. The people who built this room, however, were only interested in one.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 SUN: The Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: Yes. The island. They'd gathered proof that it existed. They knew it was out there somewhere, but they just couldn't find it. Then a very clever fellow built this pendulum on the theoretical notion that they should stop looking for where the island was supposed to be and start looking for where it was going to be.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: What do you mean, "Where it was going to be"?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: Well, this fellow presumed, and correctly, as it turned out, that the Island was always moving. Why do you think you were never rescued? Now while the movements of the Island seem random, this man and his team created a series of equations which tell us, with a high degree of probability, where it is going to be at a certain point... in time. Windows, as it were, that while open, provide a route back. Unfortunately, these windows don't stay open for very long. Yours closes... in 36 hours. 
Lost.Season05.Episode06 DESMOND: Um, I'm sorry. Excuse me.  Am I really hearing this? That's what this is about? You're all going back to the Island? Willingly?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 SUN: Yes. Why are you here, Desmond?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 DESMOND:  I came here to deliver a message.  Daniel Faraday—your son—sent me here. He wanted me to tell you that he and all the people on the Island need your help. He said that only you could help them. He didn't say Jack. He didn't say Sun. He didn't say Ben. He said you.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: But I am helping, dear.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 DESMOND:  Consider the message delivered.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Desmond, but the Island isn't done with you yet.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 DESMOND: This woman cost me four years of my life—four years that I'll never get back because you told me that I was supposed to go to the Island! That it was my bloody purpose!  You listen to me, brother, and you listen carefully.  These people—they're just usin' us. They're playing some kind of game, and we are just the pieces.  Whatever she tells you to do... ignore it.  You say the Island's not done with me? Well, I'm done with the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: Jack... the binder in your hands shows all the air routes that fly over the coordinates where I believe the Island will be in little more than a day from now. There's a commercial airliner flying from L.A. to Guam. It's going to go right through our window. Ajira Airways, Flight 316. If you have any hope of the Island bringing you back, it must be that plane. You all need to be on it. It must be that flight.  If you... want to return, you need to recreate as best you can the circumstances that brought you there in the first place. That means as many of the same people as you are able to bring with you.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: And what if we can't get anyone else to come with us? What if we're it?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: All I can tell you is the result would be... unpredictable.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: So that's it? We just get on that flight, and we just hope that it works? That's all?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: No, that's not all, Jack... at least, not for you.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: Come on in.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Ben and Sun-
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: Heard what they needed to hear, and this does not concern them.  Oh. Here we are. 
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: What's this?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: It's John Locke's suicide note.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  Uh... I, uh... I didn't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: Well, why would you? Obituaries don't see fit to mention when people hang themselves, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  Why would he kill himself?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: Ohh... there are many reasons, I'm sure, but the only one that matters is this—he is going to help you get back. John is going to be a proxy. A substitute.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: A substitute for who?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: Jack... who do you think? You need to, as best you can, recreate the conditions of the original flight... which is why you need to give John something of your father's. You have to get something that belonged to your father, and you need to give it to John.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: That's what you have to do.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: My father... is gone. My father has been dead for three years. You want me to...  a—and to give it to Locke?! He's in a coffin! This is ridiculous!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 ELOISE: Oh, stop thinking how ridiculous it is and start asking yourself whether or not you believe it's going to work. That's why it's called a leap of faith, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Where's Sun?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: She left.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: And Locke? I mean... his body? The coffin?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: I have a friend looking after it. I'll pick it up on my way to the airport.  What did she say to you, Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Nothing that matters. Who is she? Why is she... helping us? How does she know all this?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN:  Thomas the Apostle. When Jesus wanted to return to Judea, knowing that he would probably be murdered there, Thomas said to the others, "Let us also go, that we might die with him." But Thomas was not remembered for this bravery. His claim to fame came later... when he refused to acknowledge the resurrection. He just couldn't wrap his mind around it. The story goes... that he needed to touch Jesus' wounds to be convinced.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: So was he?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Of course he was. We're all convinced sooner or later, Jack. 
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Where are you going?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Oh, I made a promise to an old friend of mine—just a loose end that needs tying up. See you at the airport, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Hello? Yeah, this is him. M—he did what?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 NURSE: This is the fourth time he's left. He's gotta follow the rules, or he'll have to move to our fully assisted facility.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Yeah, I understand.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 MAGICIAN: And now, ladies and gentlemen, here is my fraidy-cat rabbit!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Hey, Ray.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RAY: Hey, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 MAGICIAN: As for my next trick, I need someone to pick a card.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Wanna get out of here?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RAY: The sooner the better.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 MAGICIAN:  Would you please pick one? Look at it.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: You wanna tell me why you took off this time, Ray?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RAY:  Do I really need to answer that?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Will you at least tell me where the bus was headed?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RAY: Doesn't matter. Anywhere I go is somewhere better than here.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  You packed a bag?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RAY: Of course I did. One of these times, I'm actually gonna get away. They won't ever find me either.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Take off again, they're gonna throw you outta here, Ray.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RAY: But what would I do without my magic shows?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  Let me help you unpack, Granddad.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RAY: So how are you, kiddo? You seeing anyone special? Whatever happened to the girl that you brought by with you that time? The pretty one with all the freckles? What was her name?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Kate. We're not together anymore.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RAY: Oh. Well, look at the bright side—more time to come visit me.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: I'd love to, Granddad. I really would, but... I think I might be... might be going away for a while.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RAY: Where's "away" exactly?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Somewhere better than here.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RAY:  Touché.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  Are these yours, Granddad?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RAY: No. Those were your father's. Your mom sent me a box of his stuff after he died. Must've got mixed in when I packed for a quick getaway.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: These shoes... can I take them?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RAY: Be my guest.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Kate? What are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: Are you still going back to the Island?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: Then I'm going with you.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Kate... what happened? Where's Aaron? Where—
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE:  No, don't ask questions. If you want me to go with you... you'll never ask me that question again. You will never ask me about Aaron. Do you understand, Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: Morning.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Morning.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Uh, I made you some coffee, and there's orange juice.  You still like milk and two sugars?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: Yeah, sure.  Those don't make much sense for the Island. You might want to consider hiking boots.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  Those were my father's.  When I went to pick up his body in Sydney, my dad didn't have any nice shoes. My mother wanted to have the funeral as soon as I landed back in L.A. But I thought, who the hell's gonna see his feet? And so I—I had these old white tennis shoes,  and I just said, "Use these. Put these on him." 'Cause he wasn't worth a nice pair of shoes to me.  Or the time it would take to go out and get 'em.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: So why don't you get rid of 'em? Why hold on to something that makes you feel sad?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: Go ahead. I- I'll see you at the airport, okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  Hello?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Hello, Jack. Are you there?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Yeah. Yeah, what's up? Is everything all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Listen, we don't have much time. I've been, uh... sidetracked, and I need you to pick up Locke's body and take it to the airport. The coffin is at Simon's Butcher Shop, corner of Grand and Hayes.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Why? Wh-what's happened to you?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Just do it. Please.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Are you Jill? Ben sent me.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JILL: I know who you are, Dr. Shephard. Come on in.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JILL:  What's in the bag?  Sorry. Ben said to give you the van. I gotta pull it around back. Give me about five minutes. 
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Wherever you are, John... you must be laughing your ass off that I'm actually doing this.  Because this... this is even crazier than you were.  And here. You can have that back. I've already heard everything you had to say, John. You wanted me to go back. I'm going back.  Rest in peace.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 VOICE ON INTERCOM: Attention, passengers on flight...
Lost.Season05.Episode06 NABIL: Mr. Shephard, if you'll just bear with me. The reason for transporting Mr. Bentham to Guam?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Uh, it was his—these were his wishes. He wanted to be buried there.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 NABIL: Who will be the recipient of the deceased upon arrival? Is there a funeral home or—
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: No, it's me. Me. I'll be escorting the body.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 NABIL: And your relation to the deceased?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: He was, uh, a friend.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 NABIL: Now, Mr. Shephard, I have to inform you that due to the increased security measures , we are required to open the casket and perform a screening. I assure you it's all done with care. Do you understand, Mr. Shephard? Mr. Shephard?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  Yes. Yes, I understand.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 NABIL:  Then please sign here. Thank you for flying Ajira Air.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 CAESAR: My condolences.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 CAESAR: I'm sorry you lost your friend.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 WOMAN OVER PA: Please remove all jackets, sweaters, jewelry and footwear. Remove all laptops and electronic devices from their cases and place them...
Lost.Season05.Episode06 SUN: Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Sun. Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 SUN: You're surprised to see me?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: I just... I thought maybe you might change your mind.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 SUN: If there's even a chance that Jin is alive, I have to be on that plane.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 WOMAN ON PA: All passengers, please have your tickets and identification available for security. Please remove all jackets, sweaters... ...all laptops and electronic devices from their cases and place them in a bin.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 WOMAN:  This is the preliminary boarding announcement for Ajira Airways Flight 316, with service to Honolulu and Guam, departing from Gate 15. For those of you on the standby list, we'll have plenty of seats available.  We would like to invite our pre-board, first class and SkyClub passengers to board the aircraft at this time.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: What do you mean "standby"? There's no standbys.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 WOMAN: Oh, no, sir. You don't need to worry. There are...  78 seats open.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: No. I bought those seats, all 78 of 'em. I'm Hugo Reyes. They're not open. They're mine. Check and see.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 WOMAN:  Yes, I see that. Sir, these people just want to get to their destination. Why would you not want them to be able to travel?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: You know, it doesn't matter why. They can take the next plane.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Hurley.  What are you doing here? How did you know about the...
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: All that matters is that I'm here, right?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  Well... I'm glad that you're here, man.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY:  Okay, then. Let's do this. After you.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Welcome to Ajira Air.  Thank you, sir. Row 8, on your left.  Welcome aboard. Yes, ma'am. You may.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 WOMAN: Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: You made it.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE:  Yeah, I made it.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 FLIGHT ATTENDANT: That should be everybody.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Hold up! Wait, please! Thank you for not closing it.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Oh, that's okay. Go right on in.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Wait! What's he doing here?!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Hurley, hey—
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: No, no! He can't come!
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: If you want to get back, this is how it's gonna have to be.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: No one told me he was gonna be here.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Who told you to be here, Hugo?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Is everything okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Yes. Yes, everything's fine. Right?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Yes, Jack. I'll be fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Are you Jack Shephard, seat 8C?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Security found this while screening your cargo.  Now if you two don't mind taking your seats, we are gonna be pushing back for takeoff.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: What's that, Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Nothing.  And the other people on this plane—what's gonna happen to them?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Who cares?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  It's pretty crazy, huh? 
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: Which part?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Hurley, Sayid... being... on the same plane. How did they end up here?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: They bought a ticket.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: You don't think that it means something? That somehow... we're all back together?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: We're on the same plane, Jack. Doesn't make us together.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 MAN OVER P.A.: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Ajira Air. This is your captain, Frank J. Lapidus, and on behalf of the entire flight crew, welcome aboard. Currently we're right on schedule, flying at a very comfortable 30,000 feet. So sit back, relax and enjoy the in-flight movie.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Excuse me, ma'am?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Mr. Shephard, can I help you?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Um, I need to talk to the pilot. Frank Lapidus and I are old friends, and if you could just tell him I'm onboard, I'd really appreciate it.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 FLIGHT ATTENDANT: All right, but you just have to go sit down because you can't be near the cockpit door when it's open.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Sure. I understand.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 FLIGHT ATTENDANT:  Captain, I have a passenger named Jack Shephard. He says he knows you. Okay, sir.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 LAPIDUS:  Well, hello, Doc. Small world.  What are you doing going to Guam?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: What are you doing here, Frank?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 LAPIDUS: Well, I picked this gig up about eight months ago. I fly this route all the time. Sometimes I take the big birds into New ... Delhi. Is... that Sayid? And Hurley. Wait a second. We're not going to Guam, are we?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  How can you read?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: My mother taught me. I can read, Jack, because it beats what you're doing.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: What's that?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Waiting for something to happen.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: And what is gonna happen?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: You tell me, Jack. You're the one that got to stay after school with Ms. Hawking.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Did you know that Locke killed himself?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: No. No, I didn't.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK:  They found this stuffed in his pocket. And I've been trying to get rid of it, but it's like it's... following me.  I know it sounds crazy, but... it feels like John needs me to read it.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Why don't you then?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Is it because you're afraid?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Afraid of what?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: Afraid that he blames you, that it's your fault he killed himself.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Was it my fault?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 BEN: No, Jack, it wasn't your fault. Let me give you some privacy.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY:  Dude... you might wanna fasten your seat belt.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 FLIGHT ATTENDANT:  Fasten your seat belt, ma'am. Sir? Please put on your seat belts. Seat belt, please.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: What happened? 
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: Can you get up?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: Yeah.  The plane... where's the plane?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: I don't know. After that light, I... I woke up in the jungle.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: So this is it? It's just us?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: I'm not sure. Do either of you remember crashing?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Crashing? No. One second, I'm being tossed around. The next thing I know, I'm in the lagoon.
Lost.Season05.Episode06 KATE: Where's Sun and Sayid?  Where's Ben?
Lost.Season05.Episode06 JACK: All right. Let's spread out, search the jungle. We come across anybody from the plane, we'll—
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RADIO LYRICS:  Yeah, your kissin', it feels so right / But you had another man...
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Dude...
Lost.Season05.Episode06 RADIO LYRICS: ...holed up last night...
Lost.Season05.Episode06 HURLEY: Jin?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: Caesar.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: Ilana. What's up?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: Find anything?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: No. Nothing useful.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: Then what'd you just put in your bag?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: ...Oh.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: If you want it, it's yours.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: We found someone—a man.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: Roxanne was scouting just south of here, and he was just standing in the water. He's wearing a suit.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: Nobody recognizes him?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: No. Whoever he is, he didn't come with us.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: Then how do we know he isn't one of the ones who disappeared?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: He's not.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: And how do you know?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: Because he wasn't on the plane.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: What did this man have to say?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: You can ask him yourself.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: Hello.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 MAN: Hello.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: My name is Caesar. What's yours?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: My name is John Locke.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: Morning.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Hello.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: Breakfast?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: We found a tree. They're pretty good.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Much obliged.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: I'm Ilana.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE:  John.  Are those your boats?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: No. They were already here. There used to be three, but the pilot and some woman took one. Didn't tell anyone, just ran off in the middle of the night.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: The pilot of the plane that brought you here?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: Yes. That's right.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Do you have a passenger list?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA:  You'll have to talk to Caesar.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Mmm.  I think this is the best mango I've ever eaten.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA:  Nobody remembers you being on the plane.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Well, I don't remember being on it either.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: What do you remember?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I remember a lot.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: Like why you're dressed up so nice?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: No, but I can guess.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA:  Please. Guess.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I think this suit is what they were gonna bury me in.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ILANA: Sorry?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: You asked what I remembered. I remember dying.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CHRISTIAN: Good luck, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CHRISTIAN: Say hello to my son.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Who's your son?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: If anybody is there, can you help me?!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Aah! Aah!

Lost.Season05.Episode07 DOCTOR: جيبوه.. جيبوه لهون 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 DOCTOR: شوي شوي.. شوي 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 MAN: اسمع كلام الدكتور 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE:  Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Sir, where am I? Who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Where am I? Do you speak English?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 DOCTOR: عايشة! 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 DOCTOR: You swallow.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 DOCTOR: Swallow.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 MAN: رجله.. رجله مكسرة 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 DOCTOR: Don't talk!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 DOCTOR: Ayesha!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 NURSE: عايشة، الدكتور مستعجل 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 NURSE (responding to Ayesha): آه

Lost.Season05.Episode07 DOCTOR: شدو، شدو.. شدوه 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Oh—what? What? What? What—
Lost.Season05.Episode07 DOCTOR: You bite. Bite!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 DOCTOR: عد لثلاثة 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 DOCTOR: ثلاثة 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 NURSE: شاكي من رجله 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 MAN: John? John, wake up.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Mm.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 MAN: You had a compound fracture. The doctors here did their best, but I had a specialist flown in to reset your leg properly.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: It's nice to see you again, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Do I know you?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE:  Yes. I understand your being confused. Imagine how I feel. I met you when I was 17. And now all these years later, here we are. You look exactly the same.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE:  Who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: My name is Charles Widmore.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: Tell me, John. How long has it been for you since... we first met, since you walked into our camp and you spoke to Richard?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Four days.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE:  That's incredible.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: The camera in the desert—that was yours?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: How did you know I'd be there?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: Well, that's the exit. I was afraid Benjamin might fool you into leaving the Island, as he did with me. I was their leader.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: The Others?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: They're not the "Others" to me. They're my people. We protected the Island peacefully for more than three decades. But then I was exiled... by him... just as you were.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: No. Ben wasn't even there when I left. He was already gone. I—I... I wasn't exiled. I... chose to leave.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: Why... would you do that, John?  You've come to bring them back... the ones who left.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE:  No.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: I understand you lying to me. I do. But there's something you should know. All your friends who left the Island? They've been back three years.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Three years?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: They've gone back to their normal lives.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: And none of them has spoken a word of truth about where they were.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I have to bring them back.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: And I'm gonna do everything in my power to help you do that.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: "Why"?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Why would you help me?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE:  Because there's a war coming, John. And if you're not back on the Island when that happens, the wrong side is going to win.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: "Jeremy Bentham"?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: He was a British philosopher. Your parents had a sense of humor when they named you, so why can't I? This should be money enough for now. The phone's international. If you need to reach me, for anything, just press 2-3. The folder contains your people's whereabouts, everyone that was on the Island that left.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: You've been watching them?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: I'm deeply invested in the future of the Island, John. So, yes, I've been watching them. I wouldn't mention I'm involved in this. I can't imagine what they think of me, having listened to Benjamin's lies.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: How do I know that you're not the one who's lying?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: I haven't tried to kill you. Would you say the same for him?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE:  You still don't trust me.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: You sent a team of killers and a boatload of C-4 to the Island. That... doesn't exactly scream "trust."
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: I needed Linus removed... so it could be your time.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Right.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: The Island needs you, John. It has for a long time.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: What makes you think I'm so special?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: Because you are.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: Ah. Your chariot has arrived.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: He said I would die.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: I beg your pardon?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Richard Alpert. He said the only way to get them to come back was if I died.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: I don't know why he said that, but I'm not gonna let that happen. This is Matthew Abaddon. He'll take you anywhere you need to go, protect you from whomever intends to do you harm.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: Mr. Locke.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WIDMORE: Good luck, John, and godspeed.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: Anything you need, Mr. Locke, you just let me know. Anything. Anybody from your past you want me to look up for you? The whole world thinks you're dead, Mr. Locke. There must be somebody who'd be happy to see you.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Please don't talk to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: You got it.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: But we're almost at the airport, so you're gonna at least have to tell me where we're going first.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Santo Domingo.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WOMAN: Andale!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 SAYID: Espera. Necesito terminar este techo. Paseme otra viga. 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 MAN: Hey, Sayid! Mira! Tienes un visitante. 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 SAYID: I don't believe this. You actually want me to go back?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I—I know how it sounds, Sayid, but you have to trust me. This is the only way to save them.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 SAYID: I'm not going back. For two years, I was manipulated into thinking I was protecting everyone on the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Who was manipulating you?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 SAYID: Ben. So who is manipulating you, John?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: This is coming from me, nobody else. I know you, Sayid. And deep down in your heart, you know we never should've left the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 SAYID: It's only because I left the Island that I was finally able to marry the woman I loved. We spent nine months together—the best nine months of my life, John. That's what I know in my heart.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Where is she now?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 SAYID: She was murdered.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Uh... I'm sorry.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 SAYID: Why do you really need to go back? Is it just because you have nowhere else to go?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: If you change your mind, I'll be staying under the name "Jeremy Bentham" in L.A. at the Westerfield Hotel.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 SAYID: And if you change your mind, you're welcome to come back here and do some real good. Good-bye, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: You asked if there was someone you could look up for me.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: Yes, I did.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Her name is Helen—Helen Norwood—and she was living in Los Angeles.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: She an old girlfriend of yours?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Help me get out of the car.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: So that's Michael Dawson's son, huh?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: Boy's gotten big.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WALT: Um, I'm—I'm-a be right back. I'm-a go.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BOY: All right.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WALT: I'm-a be right back.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BOY: All right.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: I'll give you two some privacy.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WALT: Hey, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Hi, Walt.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WALT: What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I hurt my leg. You don't seem surprised to see me.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WALT: I've been having dreams about you. You were on the Island, wearing a suit, and there are people all around you. They wanted to hurt you, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Good thing they're just dreams.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WALT: Is my dad... is he back on the Island? I haven't talked to him in three years. I figured he must've gone back.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Um, last I heard, your dad was on a freighter near the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WALT: So why'd you come to see me?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 WALT: Yeah. I'm doing pretty good. Well, I gotta go. It was good seeing you, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Yeah. Take care.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: I take it you didn't invite him along.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Boy's been through enough.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: That's 0-for-2, Mr. Locke. Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought you had to bring everyone back.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I only need to convince one. And if I can do that, the rest will come.  And maybe I was mistaken, but I thought you were my driver.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Hello, Hugo.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: So you didn't make it, huh?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Pardon me?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: You didn't make it. It's cool. No biggie. You're not the first person to visit me, you know. But what's up with the wheelchair?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Uh, I broke my leg falling down a hole.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: Oh. Is that how you died?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Hugo, I'm not dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: Sure you're not.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: No, I—I promise you, I'm very much alive.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY:  Hey, Susie, am I talking to a dude in a wheelchair right now?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 SUSIE: Yep.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: Whoa, dude. What are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I need you to come back to the Island with me.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: Wait. What?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: And not just you, but everybody who left.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: You mean Jack and Kate—
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Everybody.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: I'm sorry, dude. I don't think that's gonna happen. Jack's a doctor now, and—and Sun's, like, got her baby, and Kate's got Aaron.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: Dude, be cool. Don't look, but we're being watched.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY:  Dude!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Oh, don't worry. He's with me.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: What?!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: He's just driving me around. He's okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: That dude is far from okay. When I first got locked up in here, he showed up, claiming that he worked for Oceanic Air. He's evil! You should not be trusting that guy.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Please, just listen to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: No, no, no! I'm not listening to you!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Hugo, please, listen.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY:  La, la, la, la, la. I wanna go back in. I wanna go back in.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Hugo—
Lost.Season05.Episode07 HURLEY: No, I'm not going anywhere with you! Go away! Bye! Get out of here!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 MALE NURSE: You're safe.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: That's three visits now.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: You may wanna step up your game, Mr. Locke, or we're all in serious trouble.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: What exactly is it that you do for Mr. Widmore, Matthew?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: You're ready to talk about it now, huh? John... you're not really gonna pretend you don't remember that I was an orderly in the hospital right after your accident? That I was the one who told you to go on your walkabout? The same walkabout that put you on the plane that crashed on that Island?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: No. I remember.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: I help people get to where they need to get to, John. That's what I do for Mr. Widmore.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 KATE: The answer is no.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Kate, I don't think you understand—
Lost.Season05.Episode07 KATE: No, you made yourself perfectly clear. Everyone on the Island is gonna die if I don't go back. And the answer is no.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Why? Don't you care about them?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 KATE: Have you ever been in love, John?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 KATE: I think about you sometimes. I think about how desperate you were to stay on that Island. And then I realized... it was all because you didn't love anybody.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: That's not true. I loved someone... once. Her name was Helen.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 KATE: What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Well... it—it... it just didn't work out.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 KATE: Why not, John?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I was angry. I was... ob-obsessed.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 KATE: And look how far you've come.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: Let me help you, Mr. Locke.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE:  Did you find her?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: Find who?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Helen Norwood—the woman I asked you about.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: No, I didn't. I'm sorry.  Three years is a long time. It's possible she got married, changed her name. Maybe she moved out of state.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: You found everyone else! All of them. Sayid was in the middle of nowhere, but you can't find Helen because she moved? Your job is to get people to where they need to get to? Well, I need to get to her.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: What happened to her?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: She died of a brain aneurysm. I'm very sorry, Mr. Locke.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: She loved me. If I had just...  we could've been together.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: Maybe you could have. That wouldn't change anything. She'd still be gone.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Would she?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: Helen is where she's supposed to be. As sad as it is, her path led here. And your path, no matter what you did or what you do, your path leads back to the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: You say that like it's all det—inevitable.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: Mr. Widmore told me Richard Alpert said that you were going to die. So you tell me, John. Is that inevitable, or is it a choice?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: What, you think I wanna die? How is that... how could you possibly think that's a choice?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 ABADDON: Hey... I'm just your driver.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Matthew!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Uhh! Aah! Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Oh!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 JACK: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Jack, how did you find me?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 JACK: You were in a car accident and you were brought into my hospital. What are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE:  We have to go back.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 JACK:  Of course. Of course we do.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Jack, the people I left behind need our help. We're supposed to go back—
Lost.Season05.Episode07 JACK: —because it's our destiny? How many times are you gonna say that to me, John?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: How can you not see it? Of all the hospitals they could've brought me to, I end up here. You don't think that's fate?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 JACK: Your car accident was on the west side of Los Angeles. You being brought into my hospital isn't fate, John. It's probability.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: You don't understand. It wasn't an accident. Someone is trying to kill me.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 JACK: Why? Why would someone try to kill you?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Because they don't want me to succeed. They wanna stop me. They don't want me to get back because I'm important.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 JACK: Have you ever stopped to think that these delusions that you're special aren't real? That maybe there's nothing important about you at all? Maybe you are just a lonely old man that crashed on an Island. That's it.  Good-bye, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Your father says hello.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 JACK: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: A man—the man who told me to move the Island—the man who told me how to bring you all back—he said to tell his son hello. It couldn't have been Sayid's father, and it wasn't Hurley's, so that leaves you. He said his name was Christian.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 JACK: My... my father is dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Well, he didn't look dead to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 JACK:  He died in Australia three years ago. I put him in the coffin! He's dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Jack, please, you have to come back! You're the only one who can convince the rest of 'em! You have to help me! You're supposed to help me!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 JACK: John, it's over! It's done. We left, and we were never important. So you... you leave me alone. And you leave the rest of 'em alone!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 MAN: John? John?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: John, what are you doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: Wait, please. John, stop!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: H—how did you find me?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: I have a man watching Sayid. I'm watching all of them, keeping them safe. When you turned up, he called me.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Who... who...W—w—what are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: John, just calm down.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: What do you want from me?!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: Please, let me help—
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Answer the question!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: I'm trying to protect you.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Protect me? You shot him. You killed Abaddon.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: Yes. Yes, I did. But it was only a matter of time before he tried to kill you. I was just trying to get to you, but you drove off and crashed.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Why? Why would—
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: He was working for Charles Widmore. He's extremely dangerous.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: No! Widmore came to me. He saved me.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: No, John, he used you. He waited till you showed up so that you could help him get to the Island. Charles Widmore is the reason I moved the Island! So that he could never find it again, to keep him away so that you could lead.  You can't do this. If anything happens to you... John, you have no idea how important you are. Let me help you.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE:  There is no helping me.  I'm...  I'm a failure.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: No, John, you're not.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I am! I couldn't get any of them. I couldn't get a single one of them to come back with me. I can't lead anyone.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: Jack booked a ticket.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: W—what?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: A plane ticket from Los Angeles to Sydney, tonight. Return trip first thing in the morning. Whatever you said to him, John—it worked. And if you got Jack, you can get the rest of them.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: John... you can't die. You've got too much work to do. We've gotta get you back to that Island so that you can do it.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: Please, John. Come on.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: Come down.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: I know we can do this, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: You haven't even been to Sun yet. Let's start with her.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: No. I...  I promised Jin that I wouldn't bring her back.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: Jin is alive?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Yeah. Yeah. But he didn't want her to know. He—he wanted me to tell her that his...  that his body washed up on the beach. And, uh, he gave me his wedding ring to prove it.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: All right.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: A promise is a promise.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Thank you. 
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: You're welcome. Come on.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN:  Let's go.  I know we can do this.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: Once we can get them all in the same place... I don't know where we go from there, but we'll figure something out.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I know where we go. There's a woman here in Los Angeles.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: A woman?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Yeah, I don't know exactly where, but she shouldn't be that hard to find. Her name is—is, uh... Eloise Hawking.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: Eloise Hawking? You sure?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, why? Do you know her?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: Yes, John. I know her.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode07 BEN: I'll miss you, John. I really will.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: That symbol—it belongs to an organization called the DHARMA Initiative. They were conducting some
experiments here a while back.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: How do you know that?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I spent more than a hundred days on this Island. I know a lot.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: A hundred days? So when we crashed, you were already here.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: No. No, I, uh... I left.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: How long ago did you leave?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE:  The timing would just confuse ya.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: Well... how did you get back?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: To be honest, that part's a bit of a mystery to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: Okay, John Locke... I have a mystery, too. Maybe you can help me with it.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I'm happy to try.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: On the plane, I was sitting across the aisle from that really big guy with curly hair. When the plane started shaking—really shaking—there was a big noise and a bright light. And this really big guy with curly hair... was gone, man. I mean, literally gone. And it wasn't only him. Some of us saw it happen to other people, too. So, Mr. John Locke, do you have an idea about what happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: I think... I might know how I came to be here. But that would involve me finding my friends. Do you have a—a—a passenger list?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: No. The pilot took it when he ran off.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: And everyone's accounted for—all the people? O—other than the—the ones who disappeared.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: Yeah, yeah, except for the people who got hurt.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: "The people who got hurt"?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 CAESAR: You know him?
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode07 LOCKE: He's the man who killed me.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: I think you can let go of that now.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: No. No! No!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: No! No! No!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: James, don't.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Come on! Help me! 
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: James...  Stop.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  We can't help him. Wherever John went, he's gone. And wherever we are is before that well was ever built.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES:  Yeah, I'd say way before.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JIN: What makes you—
Lost.Season05.Episode08 LOCKE: James! Can you hear me?! Can anyone hear me?!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 LOCKE: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: What the hell was that?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES:  That one was different. It was... that was more like an earthquake.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  Locke!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  James, wait!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  Great. 
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: My headache is gone.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: Yeah, mine is, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: And my nose isn't bleeding anymore.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: I think it's over. I think John did it.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JIN: Now what?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Now we wait for him to come back.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: For how long?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: As long as it takes.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: Are you kidding me?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: I'm gone ten minutes, and you're having a hootenanny?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JERRY: Don't be such a bummer, man. Rosie was just droppin' off some brownies. You should thank her. 
Lost.Season05.Episode08 ROSIE: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: She shouldn't be here, Jerry. We're on the clock, man.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JERRY: Ah, mellow out, Phil. W-what's gonna happen, huh? The polar bears are gonna figure a way out of their cages?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: That's not the point. If LaFleur finds out what you're doing here—
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JERRY: LaFleur's not gonna find out anything.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: —it's gonna be my ass, man. I'm the one who's gonna have to answer to him.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 ROSIE: Guys? What...
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JERRY: Relax, man. Nobody's gonna find out.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 ROSIE: Guys. What...
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: Is that a Hostile?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JERRY: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 ROSIE: Is that... Horace?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JERRY: Oh, he's got dynamite.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 ROSIE: Aah! 
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: Get her out of here! Get her out of here now! Now!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JERRY: Come on, Rosie.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: I told you not to bring her here. I told you!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JERRY: You gotta get outta here now. Don't tell anyone you were here. Just go. Go!  Okay, this is bad. This is bad, man.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: We gotta get LaFleur.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JERRY: 3:00 in the morning. Do you really wanna wake LaFleur up?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: No, of course not, but—
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JERRY: No, no, no. Maybe—maybe we can handle this ourselves, huh?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: And maybe Horace blows himself up, and LaFleur kills us for not waking him.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: We gotta go—now!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: Do you wanna knock?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JERRY:  You knock.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: Fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 LAFLEUR: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: Mr. LaFleur, sorry to bother you, but we got a situation out at the pylons.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 LAFLEUR:  What kind of situation?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JERRY: Uh, it's, uh, Horace.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: He's got dynamite, and he's blowing up trees.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: Relax! I'm comin'!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES:  Hey, boss.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Evening, Enos. You got your zapper with ya?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: Yep.  You wanna tell me why I need it?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  'Cause our fearless leader is out blowin' up trees.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: Why's he doin' that?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  'Cause he's loaded.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: Since when does Horace drink?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: He doesn't, so we're gonna keep this on the down low.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: Oh, man.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: All right.  You put out that fire. Pack up this dynamite. I'll take him home.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: Why don't you put out the fire, pack up, and—and I'll take him home?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: You wanna tell Amy where we found him?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Help me get him up.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY:  Oh, my God. Is he okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: You tell me.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: Bring him inside.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: The couch. The couch is fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: Oh. Where'd you find him?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  By the Flame, blowin' up trees with dynamite. Wanna tell me why?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: We had a fight. 
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Must've been a doozy.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: Please, Jim. It's personal.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Personal? You think this isn't gonna get out? It'll be on the coconut telegraph by breakfast.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY:  It was about Paul.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Go on.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY:  Oh.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: What's the matter? You okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY:  Ohhh! The baby—it's coming.  Ohhh!!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Oh, hell.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY:  I'm not gonna tell her. Don't even tell her. I won't.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  Where's Red?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY:  No. I won't do it. I won't tell her. I won't do it. Won't...
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Daniel? You okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY: I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna tell her.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Daniel, where's Charlotte?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY:  She's not here. She... She's gone.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Where?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY: She's... dead. She's dead. There was another flash, and... and she was... she was just gone.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY: Her... body just...  disappeared. She moved on, and we stayed.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: I'm so sorry.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Hold on. Wait a minute. We "stayed"? We're not traveling through time anymore? You saying it's over?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY: Of course it's over. Wherever we are now... whenever we are now... we're here for good.  I won't do it.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  Okay. Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY: I won't. I'm not gonna—I'm—I'm...
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY: I'm not gonna—I w—I won't.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Okay. Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY: Tell...
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Okay. Swell. Until Dan checks back in, I say we head back to the beach. When Locke gets back with everybody, that's where they'll be looking for us.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: The beach? What, you didn't get enough flaming arrows shot at you? And your camp is gone. Why bother?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Sawyer's right, Miles. We should go back to the beach. We survived there before. We can do it again.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES:  Or maybe when we get there, you'll—you'll wanna go back to the Orchid again. And then when that gets boring, we can head back to the beach. It's the only two plans you people have.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Hey, zip it. I'm heading back to the beach. If our stuff's there, great. If not, we build new stuff. You don't like the plan, good luck.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: Who put him in charge?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Thanks for getting my back for that whole beach issue.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: You should thank me. It was a stupid idea.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, what does that say about you agreeing with me?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Any plan is better than no plan. Besides, if I hadn't agreed with you, we'd still be arguing about where to go next. I just hope you figure out something better before we get there.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, I'm open to suggestions.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 WOMAN:  Oh, no! No, Paul! Oh, God! Oh, God!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 WOMAN: No, no, no, no! No, please! We didn't know! Paul, please, please say something.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 WOMAN: No, no. No, no, no, no, no. We were just touring this park. We didn't mean anything. We were just having—Paul. Paul, please. Oh, my God! No!  No, Paul, please. Please.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Who do you think they are?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: Who cares who they are? We don't even know when they are.  Hey.  Dan. We don't get involved, right? That's what you said.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY:  Doesn't matter what we do. Whatever happened, happened.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  Yeah, thanks anyway, Plato. I'm going over there.  You still got my back?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Absolutely.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 WOMAN: Paul, Paul. Talk to me! Talk to me, Paul!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 BEARD: On your feet!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 WOMAN:  No, I can't! I can't!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 BEARD: Come on, get up! Now!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 WOMAN: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 BEARD: Shut up!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  All right, drop the gun!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 WOMAN:  Oh, God.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: It's all right. It's okay. You're safe. It's over.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: Who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  Her friend's wearing a DHARMA jumpsuit. That puts us in the '70s, '80s.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: The guys with the bags—Others?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Beats me.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: What, y'all don't know each other?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Before my time.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JIN: Sawyer. Walkie.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: We need to go.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: I'm on it.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Listen, sweetheart, we gotta get moving now.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: Who are you people?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Our ship wrecked here on the way to Tahiti, but that ain't important right now, 'cause whoever's on the other end of this—those two might've given 'em a call before we saved you.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: We have to bury them.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Bury them? We ain't got time to bury nobody.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY:  We—we—we have to. The truce.  Oh, God.  We have to bury them. And—and we have...  we have... and we have to bring it—him back home. We have to bring Paul back with us. Please. Please?  Please.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JIN:  I'll carry him.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: All right, we'll put these guys in the ground and carry your friend back, but we better do it fast.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: He wasn't... my friend. He was my husband. 
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  All right, listen up. When we get there, there's gonna be a lot of questions. So just keep your mouth shut. Let me do the talking.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: You really think you can convince them that we were in a boat wreck?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: I'm a professional. I used to lie for a living.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  Daniel! Stop!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Turn it off.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY:  Turn what off?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULET: Whatever that is. It looks like some sort of sonic fence or something.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: Where did you say your ship was going?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Listen, sister, we're the ones who just saved your life and hid those bodies. So how about you trust us and turn that damn thing off?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: Okay. Okay, fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  "Sonic fence"? Didn't I say let me do the talking?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  One more step, Dan would've fried his brain.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: His brain's already fried.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY:  Okay, it's off.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: You first.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: See? It's fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: All right, let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: And going forward, we should all do a better job of trustin'—
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY:  It hurts! Oh!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 DOCTOR: You're gonna be okay, Amy. Just try and relax.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 DOCTOR: Where's Horace? Does he know his wife's in labor?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: He's unavailable.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 DOCTOR: Look, Amy's in a very dangerous situation. The baby's breech.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: What the hell does that mean?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 DOCTOR: It's upside down. She needs a Caesarean.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, don't tell me about it. Just do it.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 DOCTOR: I'm an internist, not an obstetrician. Our women always deliver on the mainland. Amy was supposed to get on the sub on Tuesday. The baby's two weeks early.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Can you deliver this baby or not?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 DOCTOR: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  Hey, man. Where is she?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: What's up?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  Amy's having her baby.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  What?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  Mm.  Did you hear me? She's in trouble. Doc says she needs a Caesarean.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  We had an agreement.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Screw our agreement. He ain't never done one. I'm guessing you have.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Don't you understand that every time I try to help a woman on this island give birth, it hasn't worked?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, maybe whatever made that happen hasn't happened yet. You gotta try. You gotta help her. You're the only one that can.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: The baby's breech?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 DOCTOR: Yes, but—
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Did you try an external cephalic version?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 DOCTOR: What? No. I—
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: It's probably too late. I'm gonna need a number 12 scalpel, 14-gauge sutures—half-round if you've got them—and an epidural anesthetic.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 DOCTOR: You're gonna need? Where is Horace?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: I'm speaking for Horace now, and I say she's delivering this baby.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 DOCTOR: I don't think it's a good idea.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: I want her. I want her to do it. Huh?  Mm.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: You heard the lady.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Listen... you're gonna do great. I know you are.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY:  Oh!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  Okay. Shh.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JIN:  Is everything okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Amy went into labor.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JIN: I know. Is she okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: I don't know. There's a problem. Juliet's in there.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JIN: Juliet?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Yeah, I pulled her out of retirement.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Any luck?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JIN: We finished grid 1-3-3 today. No sign of our people. No one.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, 1-3-4 then.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JIN: How long do we look, James?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: As long as it takes.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  It's a boy.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: He's okay? She's okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  Everyone's okay. 
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Mm.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: How's your head?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: It hurts.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Where are my people?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: They're fine. Amy told me what happened in the jungle, and I really appreciate what you did.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, y'all got a funny way of showing your appreciation.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Look, we have certain defense protocols. There are hostile indigenous people on this island, and we don't get along with them. So... why don't you tell me who the hell you are?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: My name's James LaFleur. You can call me Jim.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: How'd you get to the island, Jim?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: If my friends are safe, why are you asking me all the questions?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: They told me I need to talk to you, that you're the boat captain.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: We got caught in a storm. Our ship wrecked. Must've hit the reef. Thankfully, we washed up on shore.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: What kind of ship?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: A salvage vessel. Searching for a famous lost wreck. It's an old slaver out of Portsmouth, England, called the Black Rock. You heard of her?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Can't say that I have.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: So... once you got washed ashore, why were you then wandering around in the jungle?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Some of our crew were missin'. We were looking for 'em. That's when we came upon your girl instead.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Hmm. Well...  I tell you what, Jim. If your crew shows up, we'll send 'em along with ya.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Send 'em where?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: There's a submarine that leaves this island first thing in the morning. You and your friends, you're gonna get on it. It's gonna drop you off in Tahiti. You can find your way home from there.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Hold on a minute, chief. We just saved that woman's life. Doesn't that earn us a week or two to find the rest of our people?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Nope. Only people that are allowed to stay on this compound are members of the DHARMA Initiative. And look, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, please, Jim, but you are not DHARMA material.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: We're screwed. He's probably trying to explain time travel by now.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Sawyer's gonna be fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: What are you lookin' at?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: I lived here for over three years. That was my house over there.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: You were in the DHARMA Initiative?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: No. The Others took over these Barracks and wiped out most of the people living in them. They brought me here on a sub a long time after that.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: Well... welcome home.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JIN: Daniel... no more flash?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY: No. No more flash. The record is spinning again. We're just not on the song we wanna be on.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RED-HEADED GIRL:  Hey, Mum. Where's Dad?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 WOMAN:  Come on, Luv. 
Lost.Season05.Episode08 FARADAY:  Charlotte.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Hello. Somebody will be along shortly to show you to your rooms. In the meantime, Mr. LaFleur here can fill you in on the situation.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: "Mr. LaFleur"?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: It's Creole. I improvised.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: What happened in there?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, he believed my story. But we're gettin' punted. The bastard's puttin' us on their sub tomorrow and shipping us off to Tahiti.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES: How's that bad news?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 WOMAN: You guys, come on! Now!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MAN: Let's go! Get in! Get in! Get in! Move!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MAN: Let's go! Get out of here!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MAN: Come on! Come on!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: Come on! Get inside! Move! Now!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: Heather, keep an eye on them.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Uh-oh.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Hello, Mr. Alpert.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RICHARD: Hello, Mr. Goodspeed.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: I wish you would've told me you were coming. I would've turned the fence off for you.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RICHARD: That fence may keep other things out, but not us.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RICHARD: The only thing that does keep us out, Horace, is our truce... which you've now broken.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: I don't know what you're talking about.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RICHARD: Where are my two men?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 MILES:  You know what? Gettin' on that sub is starting to sound like a great idea. What do you say? Sub, anyone?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Hold your horses, Banzai. No one's gettin' on a sub.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Okay, LaFleur, how well'd you bury those bodies?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, that depends on how hard he looks.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Call the Arrow. Tell them we're at Condition One. Take the heavy ordnance, and make sure the fence is at maximum.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 PHIL: Yes, sir.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Let me talk to him.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Your buddy out there with the eyeliner—let me talk to him.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: We had a truce with these people. You don't understand.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: I understand I'm the one that killed his men, and I'm the one that's gonna go out there and tell him why I did it.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE:  I can't let you do that.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, it's a good thing I ain't asking your permission.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: James, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Not yet.  But I'll figure somethin' out.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Hello, Richard.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RICHARD: I'm sorry. Do we know each other?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: I'm the guy that killed your men. Heard some gunshots, saw two men throwing a bag over a woman's head. Gave 'em a chance to throw the weapons down and walk away, but one of them took a shot at me, and I defended myself.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RICHARD: Is that so?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: That's so.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RICHARD: Your people know that you're telling me this?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: They ain't my people, Hoss. So if you got some kind of a truce with them, it ain't been broken.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RICHARD: If you're not a member of the DHARMA Initiative, then what are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Did you bury the bomb?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RICHARD: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: The hydrogen bomb with "Jughead" written on the side. Did you bury it?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RICHARD: How...
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Yeah, I know about it. I also know that 20 years ago, some bald fella limped into your camp and fed you some mumbo jumbo about being your leader. And then poof... he went and disappeared right in front of ya. Any of this ringin' a bell? That man's name is John Locke, and I'm waitin' for him to come back. So... you still think I'm a member of the damn DHARMA Initiative?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RICHARD: No. I guess I don't. But no matter who you are, two of my men are dead. And my people need some kind of justice.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 RICHARD: Now what are we gonna do about that?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: How are you doing, Amy?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY:  Is he gone?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: Alpert?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: No, he's not gone. We told him where the bodies were.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY:  You told him? Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: We had to. It was the only way to maintain the truce. Jim here worked it out with him, but... well, he's gonna need something from us now. He needs to take Paul's body back with him.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY:  Mm.  No. Oh!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: Oh. 
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Hey, Ames. Listen, w—
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: We've been friends for a long time, yeah? So this is completely your choice. If you don't want to give him to them, then we will suffer the consequences.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 AMY: They can take him. He would want to keep us safe.   Can I have a minute, please?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: You need some help?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Hmm? Oh. Nah, I've got it. Thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Hey, Jim, the sub leaving tomorrow morning—it returns in two weeks. Until then, you can stay and look for the rest of your crew.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: I bought us two weeks. Horace said we can wait for the next sub. Any luck, Locke'll be back by then.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: And then what?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: What do you mean, "Then what"?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  Locke said he was leaving to save us. The flashes have stopped. They're over. No more bloody noses. We're already saved. That sub behind you brought me here. I've been trying to get off of this island for more than three years, and now I've got my chance.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: I'm going to leave.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  You do realize it's 1974, that whatever it is you think you're going back to... it don't exist yet.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  It's not a reason not to go.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Well, what about me? You really gonna leave me here with the mad scientist and Mr. "I Speak to Dead People"?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: And Jin, who's a hell of a nice guy but not exactly the greatest conversationalist.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET:  You'll be fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Maybe... but who's gonna get my back?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Come on. Just give me two weeks, that's all I'm asking. Two weeks.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: All right. Two weeks.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Mmm, somethin' smells good.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Hey there.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Is that for me?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: You were amazing today.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Thank you for believing in me.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Ah.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Mm.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: I love you.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Mmm. I love you, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Mmm.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Mmm.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Wake up, boss.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Ah.  Oh!
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: How's your head?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE:  It hurts.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: I got good news and bad news. What you want first?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE:  Good news.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: You're a daddy. Bad news is you missed it.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Oh, gosh. Amy... she had the baby?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  It's a boy.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: A boy?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Mm.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: Ohh. 
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  Now how about you tell me why you're too busy drinkin' and blowin' up trees to see him get born?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: I was, uh...  I was looking for a pair of socks, and all of mine were dirty, so I went to grab a pair of Amy's, and... I found this...
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: ...in the back of her drawer. It was Paul's.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: You got in a fight over a necklace?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 HORACE: I know.  But... It's only been three years, Jim. Just three years that he's been gone. Is that really long enough to get over someone?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  I had a thing for a girl once. And I had a shot at her, but I didn't take it. For a little while, I'd lay in bed every night, wondering if it was a mistake. Wondering if... I'd ever stop thinking about her. And now I can barely even remember what she looks like. I mean, her face—it's... she's just gone. And she ain't never coming back. So... is three years long enough to get over someone? Absolutely.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Oh. 
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER:  What? ... Wait. What? ... H—no. No. Don't bring 'em in. Just meet me in the North Valley.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Who was it?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: James, what's going on?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: It was Jin.
Lost.Season05.Episode08 JULIET: Is everything okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode08 SAWYER: Yeah. I just... I gotta go.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: Wanna hear something crazy?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: What's that?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT:  Did you see the big guy when we got on in L.A.?  Sitting in first class, curly hair, guitar case?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: What about him?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: He's one of the Oceanic Six.  Guy's got nerves of steel, man.  He survives a full-on commercial airliner crash.  Now he's back flying over the same South Pacific?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Yeah, well...  maybe he doesn't believe that lightning will strike twice in the same place.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: You all right there, Frank?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: I'm just fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 [The rattling resumes, more violently now, then stops.  The co-pilot reaches above him and flips a switch.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: Dude... you might wanna fasten your seat belt.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS:  Oh, no.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT:  What?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Autopilot off!  I have the controls.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: Autopilot off.  You have the controls.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Pull that rudder!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT:  What?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE: Stall.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: What?!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE: Stall.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: We've lost power!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE: Stall.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: Restarting one.  Restarting two.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: Altimeter reading 650.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Oh, my God.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Give me more power!  I can pull us out of this!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: You're gonna rip us apart!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Do it!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Come on.  Come on.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: Is that a runway?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Massive instrument failure!  We're puttin' her down!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: Mayday!  Mayday!  Mayday!  This is Ajira 3-1-6!  Mayday!  Mayday!  Mayday!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 AUTOMATED MALE VOICE: 4...8...15...16...
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Full flaps!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: Gear down!  Airspeed 190!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: We're coming in too steep!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Reverse thrusters!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CO-PILOT: Come on!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: We're runnin' out!  We're runnin' out!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Hold on!  Brace for impact!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Hey!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CAESAR: Hey.  Hey, lady.  Are you okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 ILANA: Jarrah?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CAESAR: No.  My name is Caesar.  We had an accident.  But we're okay now.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CAESAR: Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 ILANA: Ohh.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN:  Frank?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Sun.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: You all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Oh, my God.  What happened?!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS:  I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Where's everyone else?  Jack and... Kate and Hurley--where'd they go?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BEN: They're gone.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS:  Gone?  Gone where?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BEN:  How would I know?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: You're alive.  Dude!  I can't believe it! 
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: Oh!  Oh!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Easy on the ribs there, Kong.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: "Kong."  I actually missed that.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Missed you, too, Hugo.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Sawyer.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Doc.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Good to see you, Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: You, too, James.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER:  You're really here.  Son of a bitch actually did it!  Locke said he was gonna bring you back, but... where is he?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: John's dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Dead?  How?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Doesn't matter.  He's gone.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: So what's up with you guys and the old DHARMA jumpsuits?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: You didn't tell 'em?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: No.  I was waiting for you.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: Tell us what?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: We're in the DHARMA Initiative.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: They came back to the Island?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: No.  We came back.  And so did you.  It's 1977.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: Uh... what?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK:  So you're telling me that you've been here, living with the DHARMA Initiative for the past three years.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: That's right.  How long's it been for you since the chopper?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: Three years.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 MILES:   Hey, Jin, this is Miles.  Where are you?  Over. 
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: If I don't report in soon, they'll send out a patrol. What should we do with them?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY:  Dude, your English is awesome.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: What we do is we bring 'em in.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Bring us in where?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Back to the Barracks at DHARMAville.  You can't be wandering around in the jungle with the Hostiles.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: "The Hostiles"?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: The Others.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: What about everyone else from the plane?  They could still be out there.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: What do you mean, everyone else?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: We didn't come back alone.  Sayid was on the plane, too.  Lapidus... and Sun.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Jin!  Hold up!  Where you goin'?!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: The Flame.  If a plane landed on the Island, Radzinsky will know.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Hold on!  We gotta think about this!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: All right.  That's it.  Listen, you guys gotta stay put.  Don't go nowhere, don't do nothing till I can figure out how the hell to explain where you came from.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: Sawyer, wait.  Other than you and Jin, who else is still here?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: Miles, have you seen James?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 MILES: Nope.  He's not answering his walkie, either.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: Jin called him this morning, then he just ran off without telling me what was going on.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 MILES: Well, let's see what we've got.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 MILES: Hang on.  There he is.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: You seen my baggy sweatshirt, the one with the bulldog on it?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: It's in the laundry.  James... what's going on?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: They're back.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: I'm sorry.  Who's back?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Jack, Hurley, Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: I know.  They came back, Juliet.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: Are they here now?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Yeah.  They're out at the North Point, waitin' for me to tell 'em what to do.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET:  How did they get...
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: I'm not sure.  They said they were on a plane.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER:   I don't understand it any more than you do.  But they're here, and I gotta find a way to bring 'em in before somebody else finds 'em and they screw up everything we got here.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: There's, um, a sub coming in this afternoon.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: Hey, you understand the concept of knocking?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: Oh, get your hands off that!  I thought you learned English.  I said, hands off!  Nobody handles any of the gear in this station except me.  Understand?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: I need to check the radar logs.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: For what?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: Please.  I need to know if a plane landed on the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: If a plane landed?  Here?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: What, so you think if a plane landed on our Island, I'd be over there just building my model?  That I wouldn't have called anyone?  That I wouldn't have put out an alert?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: Maybe you missed it.  Can you check with the other stations?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: I just told you I would not be--
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: Check with the other stations.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: Attention all stations, this is a system-wide broadcast from Radzinsky at the Flame.  I'm checking in to see if anyone's seen an airplane over the Island.    No one else has seen an airplane, but if you have, could you call in to me, please?  Over.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: So what are you all hot and bothered about, Kwon?  Why is this plane so damn important?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: It just is.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 ILANA: Did you lose someone?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 ILANA: I just saw you looking around.  I thought maybe you lost someone on the plane.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: No.  I was traveling alone.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Can I get everybody's attention?!  Everybody, please!  Listen up, folks!  Here's where we're at.  The radio's dead, so I haven't been able to call in our situation.  But that's all right.  Soon as they figure out we're not where we're supposed to be, they'll come looking for us.  So best thing to do right now is just stick together.  Stick together, hunker down and just wait till help gets here.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CAESAR: And where is here?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: What's that?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CAESAR: Where is here?  What is this place?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: I don't know where "here" is because this island's not on my charts.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CAESAR: Really?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Really.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CAESAR: Because there are some buildings over there... and animal cages.  Down the beach, you can see a bigger island across the water.  So maybe you should get some new charts.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Right now, I'm just trying to keep everyone here safe.  So let's gather up some firewood.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CAESAR: If he wants to wait, let him!  I say we search these buildings!  Maybe they have a radio or some food!  Who wants to help me?!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BEN: Why are you following me?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Where are you going?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BEN: Back to our Island.  ...You wanna come?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 AMY: Juliet?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: Hey, Amy.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to wake you.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 AMY: Oh, no, it's fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: I just came to get the sub manifest.   Obviously, I don't want you working today.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 AMY: Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: Full load?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 AMY: Almost.  Two of the recruits dropped out in the eleventh hour.  They didn't want to take the sedative for the trip.  Can you tell Pierre for me?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: Hi.  Hi.  Oh, hello, little one.  Hi.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: Have you and Horace decided on a name?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 AMY: Yeah, we have.  We're gonna name him Ethan.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 AMY: Oh, hey, buddy. So... when are you and Jim gonna have one of these?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: I don't know.  Timing's gotta be right.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: So the woman who told you how to come back... did she mention that it would be 30 years ago?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: No.  No, she left that part out.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: So what are we supposed to do now?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: I'm not sure yet.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: Sawyer's back!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: All right, listen.  Y'all are gonna be the second batch of recruits comin' in off the sub pullin' into port right about now, so we ain't got much time.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Nice suit, doc.  Not exactly Island wear.  Try this.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: You want us to say we came in on the sub.  How's that gonna work?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Everyone gets knocked out before the trip, so no one meets each other until we process 'em.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Look, we need to find the rest of the people from the plane.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: If there was a plane, Jin will find it.  So we got about ten minutes to make intake, or y'all are gonna be camping in the jungle for a long time.  There ain't another batch of recruits due in for six months.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK:  What do you think?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: I think we should listen to Sawyer.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: I vote for not camping.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Trust me.  Do what I say.  Everything will be fine.  Let's move.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: I just heard from the Looking Glass.  They were the last station to check in.  They got nothing but an incoming sub.  Why don't you go home, and I'll call you if something happens?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: Move.  Move.  Out of my way.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: Those bastards.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: What do you see?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: Grid 325.  Motion sensor alarm was tripped.  We got a Hostile inside the perimeter.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: Hey!  Where you going?!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: Stop right there!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: Sayid?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAYID: Jin?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN:  Where's Sun?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAYID: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: Shut up!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: Get down!  Say another word, and you're dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: Okay, so it's 1977.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Yep.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: And... you guys are all members of the DHARMA Initiative.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Yep.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: Well, you do realize those dudes get wiped out, right?  I saw where all the bodies got dumped.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: What about it?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: Well, aren't you gonna warn 'em?  Aren't you gonna stop it from happening?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: I ain't here to play Nostradamus to these people.  Besides, Faraday's got some interesting theories on what we can and can't do here.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Did you say Faraday?  He's here?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Not anymore.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 WOMAN ON PA: ...recruits will be going inside for processing, where you'll be given your work assignment and lodging.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Put these on and listen up.  Juliet's got it worked out so your name's gonna be on the list, all right?  So when you get in there, just watch the little meet and greet video, wait for 'em to call your name.  When they do, just smile, step up, take your jumpsuits and work assignments.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Work assignments?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Yeah, don't worry.  I got it covered.  Just remember to act a little doped up, 'cause you just woke up from the sub.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: What if they start asking us questions we can't answer, like, uh, who's president in 1977?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: It's not a damn game show, Hugo.  Besides, I'm gonna be in there to get your backs, all right?  Let's move.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 MILES: LaFleur!  Where have you been?  I've been trying to reach you on the walkie.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 MILES:  What--what the hell are they doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: They're our new inductees.  I'll explain everything later.   Stop staring and tell me what your damn problem is.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 MILES: It's, uh... it's Jin.  There's a 14-J at the Flame.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER:  Jin, you there?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN:  James, we have a problem.  We found a Hostile.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER:  What?!  What do you mean you found a hostile?  Where?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN:  He was wandering in the jungle.  Radzinksy's taking care of him now.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER:  What's he doing in our territory?  It's a violation of the truce.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN:  It's Sayid.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: What?!  Son of a bitch!  Was anyone else with him?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN:  No.  He was alone.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Wait!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BEN: I'm sorry, Sun, but waiting doesn't interest me much right now.  There are three outriggers near here and I'm gonna take one.  So you can come along and help me row...  or you can stay here.  Frankly, it makes no difference to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Why are you leaving?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BEN: Why are you staying?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: The main Island... is that where Jin is?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BEN: Honestly, I don't know.  But that's where I'd start looking.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Sun!
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Over here.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BEN: Hello, Frank.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS:  You all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Yes, I'm fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: I got worried when I couldn't find ya.  I saw him leaving.  What are you doing out here?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Ben knows where there's a boat.  I'm going back to the main Island with him.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: You don't think you can really trust this guy, do ya?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: I have to trust him.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BEN:  You're ready?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Sun.  I want you to think about this, okay?  This guy is dangerous.  Sun, that boat I came here on--it was filled with commandos whose only mission was to get him.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BEN: And how'd that work out for everyone?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Don't do it.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Why don't you come with us?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: I can't.  I got a group of people I gotta look after.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BEN: That's right, Frank.  A captain's first responsibility is to his passengers.  But I have people I have to take care of, too.  There's a small dock about a half mile due south across the water.  It leads directly to a town where I used to live.  There are resources there.  So, if anyone can help you and the rest of the plane get out of here safely, it--
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: I thought you trusted this guy.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: I lied.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: How are we gonna do this?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL:  Shephard?  Jack Shephard?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Here we go.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: Hey, Jack.  Have a seat.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 DR. CHANG: Of course it isn't here... 
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: What's that?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 DR. CHANG: Your file.  Could they be any more disorganized on the other side?  Sorry.  Namaste.  I'm Pierre Chang.  Welcome to the DHARMA Initiative.  How was your ride in?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: It was fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 DR. CHANG: Good.  Who was your shuttle driver?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 DR. CHANG: Uh... the shuttle from the sub.  Who was your driver?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Oh, that was, uh... um... Mr. LaFleur.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 DR. CHANG: Ah, yes.  Good man, LaFleur.  Runs a very tight operation.    I'm sorry for the disorganization.  The woman who was supposed to be processing you in had a baby last night.  I got pulled out of my lab.  I... ah, here it is... your job assignment.   You've been assigned to the Shed.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: "Work man." What does--what does that mean?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 DR. CHANG: Based on your aptitude test, you'll be doing janitorial work.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: Hey there, ma'am.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: Hi.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: They haven't called you yet?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: No.  Not yet.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: What's your name?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: Kate... Austen.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: Austen.   Austen...  Huh.  You're not on my list, and you're not on the sub manifest either.  Who's your recruiter?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: Um...
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: Hold on, Phil.   I just got the new list from Amy.  Some, uh, last-minute additions, including... Miss Austen?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: All righty then.  She's all yours.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: I'm sorry for the mix-up.  I'm Juliet.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 KATE: Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: Hi, Kate.  Welcome to the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: What the hell happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: Sayid just came walking out of the jungle in handcuffs alone.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: What?  Did he say anything about the plane they were on?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JIN: No, I couldn't talk to him.  Radzinsky thinks he's a Hostile.  He won't leave us alone.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER:  I got this.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Where is he?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: Locked in the storage room.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Give me the key.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: You need to know, LaFleur--he saw the model of the Swan, and he could've seen the survey of where we're building it.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Your point is?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: He's a spy.  This whole thing is an act, and we either play into it or we don't.  We can end this right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: What the hell are you talking about, Radzinsky?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: We shoot him.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Well, I appreciate your input there, quick draw.  But I wanna talk to him first.  Give me the damn keys.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER:  My name's LaFleur.  I'm head of security.  I want you to listen real carefully to what I got to say.  And if you do that, you'll be fine.  Understand?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: All right, let's start simple.  Identify yourself as a Hostile.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: The terms of the truce say you gotta identify yourself as a Hostile, or we got the right to shoot you.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAYID: We do not refer to ourselves as "Hostile", but yes, I--I am one of them.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER:  All right. Good. Then we can proceed like a couple of gentlemen.  Let's go.  Just taking him back to the barracks.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: Oh, if you're taking him in, then I'm coming with you.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: This is a horrible mistake.  I'm gonna talk directly to Horace about this.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Fine.  Talk away.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: You wanna remind me why the hell we're doing this?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Ben said if my husband is on the Island, the best place to start looking for him is here.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Oh, I see, that's some advice you took before you whacked him in the head.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Whoa.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Tell me you saw that.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Probably just an animal.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Animal.  Right.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: I'm sorry to say, Sun, but... I don't think we're gonna find your husband here.  Maybe we oughta just head back.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 MAN: Hello.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Who the hell are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 MAN: My name's Christian.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: I'm looking for my husband.  His name is Jin Kwon.  Do you know where he is?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CHRISTIAN: Follow me.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: What is this place?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CHRISTIAN: '72... '76, '78...
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: Where is my husband?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CHRISTIAN: Uh, here we go. '77.  He's, uh... he's with your friends.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SUN: What are you talking about?  What friends?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 CHRISTIAN: I'm sorry, but you have a bit of a journey ahead of you.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 MAN: Okay, ready? Everybody say, "Namaste!"
Lost.Season05.Episode09 ALL: Namaste.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: Nama-what?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: Okay.   Right on. So you guys have the rest of the day to get acquainted with your security protocol handbooks waitin' in your new digs.  Now some of it may seem a little scary, but I promise you all, we are perfectly safe here, okay?  So make yourselves at home.  Come on.  We got hamburgers.  We got punch.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER:  You there, Phil?  We're coming in with a 14-J.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: Roger that, Mr. LaFleur.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: Okay, if I could get everyone to hold back, please, we have a minor security situation.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 RADZINSKY: Move.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 HURLEY: I guess we found Sayid.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: All right, you can hang out here until we can figure out what the hell to do with you.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: What are we gonna do with him?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Bring the man some damn food.  We're not savages.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Ah, excuse me.  Um...  Could you tell me where James LaFleur lives?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: Uh, that's his house right there.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK:  Thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: But I wouldn't call him "James".  He hates it.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: 
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET:  Hey, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK:  I saw you earlier today when you were helping Kate, and I wanted to say something to you then, but...
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: We're not supposed to know each other.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Yeah. Um... I was looking for Sawyer.  I guess I came to the wrong house.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET: No. Come in.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Evening, Doc.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JULIET:  Well, I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Take a load off.  You want a beer?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: No.   No, I'm fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: What can I do for you, Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK:  I don't even know where to start.  Uh... how about with Sayid?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: I had no choice.  He was running around in the jungle, got caught by my people.  And seein' as how he can't tell the truth about how he got here, I had to improvise.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Improvise?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: Uh-huh.  And for now, Sayid is safe, which is all that matters.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: So where do we go from here?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: I'm working on it.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Really?  Because it looked to me like you were reading a book.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER:  I heard once Winston Churchill read a book every night, even during the Blitz.  He said it made him think better.  It's how I like to run things.  I think.  I'm sure that doesn't mean that much to you, 'cause back when you were calling the shots, you pretty much just reacted.  See, you didn't think, Jack, and as I recall, a lot of people ended up dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: I got us off the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: But here you are...  right back where you started.  So I'm gonna go back to reading my book, and I'm gonna think, 'cause that's how I saved your ass today.  And that's how I'm gonna save Sayid's tomorrow.  All you gotta do is go home, get a good night's rest.  Let me do what I do.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAWYER: ...now ain't that a relief?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BOY: Hey, Phil.  I'm just gonna go in there and deliver him a sandwich.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 PHIL: All right.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BOY: Hello.  I brought you a sandwich.  I didn't put mustard on it, but if you'd like some, I could get some.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAYID: This will be fine.  Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BOY: Are you a Hostile?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAYID: Do you think I am?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BOY: What's your name?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAYID: Sayid.  What's yours?
Lost.Season05.Episode09 BOY: I'm Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode09 SAYID: It's nice to meet you, Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 MAN:   
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BOY:  
Lost.Season05.Episode10 MAN:  
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BOY: 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 MAN: 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 MAN:  
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BOY: 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 MAN: 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 MAN: 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: Hey Phil.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 PHIL: Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: I brought another sandwich for him. Chicken salad this time.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 PHIL: Yeah, I don't think it's the menu. He's not eating. Save yourself the trouble kid.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: But Horace told me to.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 PHIL: Why does he care so much? That guy's a hostile.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: That doesn't mean he's not hungry.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 PHIL: Whatever.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: Brought you a sandwich. And a book. I read it twice. It's good.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:  Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: Did Richard send you?  Richard. He's your leader, right?  It's just a camera. They can see, but they can't hear. Four years ago I ran away into the jungle and Richard found me. I said I wanted to leave. That I wanted to join you. So I've been patient. And if you're patient too, I think I can help you.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 [Flashback - A man rushes in through a doorway, frantically dropping his bags and shutting the door behind him. He scrambles along hallway into a room, whose door he deadbolts upon entering. He briefly stops to listen at the door. When he hears banging noises coming from outside the room, he rushes to a large wooden cabinet and begins emptying it of its contents. A safe is revealed inside. The banging noises continue as the man enters the combination and opens the safe. Suddenly, the room’s door bursts open and Sayid appears, holding a gun, which he points at the man.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 MAN 2:  Подожди!  Подожди!  Подожди, не стреляй!  Триста или четыреста тысяч евро.  Они все твои.  Пожалуйста, пожалуйста.
Hold on!  Hold on!  Hold on, don't shoot!  Three or four hundred thousand euros.  It's all yours . Please, pleasе. 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: How'd it go?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: He tried to bribe me. It didn’t work.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: Of course it didn't.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Where to now?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN:  Nowhere. You're done.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:  What do you mean I'm done?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: We're done. Andropov was the last one. You've taken care of everyone who posed a threat to your friends.  It's been a pleasure working with you, Sayid. 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:  So that's it? I killed all those people for you, and now you're just walking away?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: You didn't kill them for me, Sayid. You're the one that asked for their names. There's no one else in Widmore's organization that we need to go after. Congratulations! Mission accomplished! 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:  What do I do now?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: I suppose you should go live your life. You're free, Sayid. 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: Put out your hands. Come on.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: It's nice to finally hear your voice. I'm Horace.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: Now's the part where you tell me your name.  I need you to tell me what you were doing out in that jungle.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 RADZINSKY: Ask him about the model.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: Radzinsky! I got this.  Those handcuffs...are you having some kind of problem with your people? Because either you're in some kind of disagreement, which makes me want to help you, or you're a spy, trying to infiltrate us. So which is it?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: Okay. I'm gonna give you an hour to decide whether you want to talk to me. But if you decide you don’t want to, then I'm gonna have to take this to the next level.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: I think your bacon's ready.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JULIET:  Hmm. I forgot.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: What's on the TV?  Ah.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JULIET:  It's over, isn't it?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: What's over?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JULIET: This. Us. Playing house. All of it. I never actually thought they'd come back.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: So they're back! Nothing's changed.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JULIET: What if Sayid tells them who he is?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Sayid ain't sayin' nothin'.  Hey. I got this under control.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER:  Mornin' H.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: Jim.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: What's up?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE:  Juliet.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JULIET: Horace.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE:  I just spoke to the prisoner. We have a problem.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER:  Why, what'd he say?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: Nothing. Which is what worries me. We need to find out why he violated the truce. Why the hell he would come into our territory. I'm just going to have to have Oldham do his thing on him.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: That psychopath? No way!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: What choice do I have?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Just let me have a go at him alone.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: Be my guest, but I'm telling you, man, he is not gonna talk.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Oh, he'll talk to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 PHIL: Mr. LaFleur!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Take your lunch Phil.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 PHIL: You going back there alone?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER:  Take your lunch, Phil. 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER:  How you doin'?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:  A twelve-year-old Ben Linus brought me a chicken salad sandwich. How do you think I'm doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER:  Sweet kid, huh?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: How can you live with him here?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: 'Cause I ain't got a choice.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Is that so?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Let's see how you feel after three years of livin' in the seventies. Lucky for you, I spent that time gettin' myself into a position to save your ass.  I'm sorry, Sayid. 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: What are you doing?!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: When I tell them I got your confession I need them to believe that you didn't give it up easy.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: What confession?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: We're gonna say you were trying to defect. You're gonna offer some intel on the others in exchange for living with us.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: And why in God's name would I want to do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: What the hell else am I supposed to do with you?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Let me go!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: And then what? I can’t just let you go!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Why not?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: 'Cause these people trust me! I've built a life here – and a pretty good one. I let you go, all that goes away. So you got yourself a choice, Chief. Either you cooperate and join the party in Dharmaville, or you're on your own.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Then I guess I'm on my own.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HURLEY: Fresh off the griddle. And don't forget to try the dipping sauces. They really
bring out the ham.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JACK: Thanks, Hurley.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HURLEY: So...  What's going on with Sayid?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JACK: Don't know anything yet.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: What do you mean, you don't know anything? I thought you were at Sawyer's last night. What did he tell you?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JACK: He told me to leave him alone and let him do his job.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HURLEY: And you're going to?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: I'll talk to Juliet, see what she can tell me.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HURLEY: Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you anything, why would Juliet?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: Well, why wouldn't she?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HURLEY: 'Cause they're together.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: What do you mean, they're together?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HURLEY: "Together" as... They live together. Like, not as roommates. You know, "together" like you guys were.
I thought it was kind of obvious. I mean, who couldn't see that comin'?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JACK: Hurley.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HURLEY: Well, I guess I better... Go make some more waffles.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: Did you know?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: Hmm.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER: You know what I can't figure out? Is how the hell you got caught. You hostiles are supposed
to be the kings of the jungle. And how dumb are you that you got captured by these idiots? 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: And yet you're the one who mops up after them.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER: Yeah, well... We'll see how cute you are once Oldham gets done with you, pal.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER: What the hell are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN:  I was bringing you a sandwich.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER: A sandwich?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER: You never made me a sandwich in your life.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: Yeah, well... I-I made one for myself...
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER: Uh-huh.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: So... So I just thought that I'd bring you--
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER: Oh, yeah? You just...
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN:  Dad, don't!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER: Don't you lie to me. What are you doin' down here?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER: You made this sandwich for him, didn't you? Hmm?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN:  Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER: Who told you to do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: Nobody.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER:  Nobody?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: I just thought that--
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER: You "just thought," huh? Go home.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: 
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ROGER: Go on. I'll tell you what to think.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: How did you find me?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: I looked.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: What do you want, Ben?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: John Locke is dead. I think he was murdered.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Why would anyone kill him?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: I'd say it was retribution for the work you and I have been doing. So you're in danger, Sayid. If I can find you, so can the people that found Locke. The same people who, even as we speak, are sitting outside Hugo's mental institution.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: They're watching him?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: A man in a sedan has been there all week, just waiting... presumably for you or me to show our faces.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: And that's why you're here? You actually came all this way to suggest that I kill this man?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: You don't want to?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: What makes you think I want to?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: Because, Sayid... to put it simply, you're capable of things that most other men aren't. Every choice you've made in your life, whether it was to murder or to torture, it hasn't really been a choice at all, has it? It's in your nature. It's what you are. You're a killer, Sayid.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I'm not what you think I am. I don't like killing.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: Well, then I apologize. I was mistaken about you.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER:  All right, last chance. You got anything to say?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER:  Take him to Oldham.

Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:   Who is that man?

Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM: Better put him in the restraints.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM:  Don't worry. They're for your protection. There are side effects to what I'm giving you.  Open his mouth.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 PHIL: Open up.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM:  Don't be afraid. Just turn your mind off. Let it take effect.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM:  It's beyond your control, so fighting it is a poor use of your energies. You see, whether you struggle or not, one thing's for sure, friend. You will tell us the truth.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN:  There's somebody--somebody here in Los Angeles. Let me take you to them.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SUN: Who?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: The same person that's gonna show us how to get back to the island.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: Is that what this is about? This is insane. You are all crazy.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: Sayid, where are you going?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I don't want any part of this.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:  And if I see you again, it'll be extremely unpleasant for us both.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Ahh.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 WOMAN: Do you have a menu?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BARTENDER: There you go.  Sir? Another MacCutcheon?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Please.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 WOMAN:  What's that run you?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: That scotch. What's a glass of that run you?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Whatever it is, it's worth it.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: I don't understand why someone would pay 120 bucks for a glass of anything.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: If you knew what my drink cost, why did you ask me?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: Same reason I'm eating my dinner here instead of a table.  I'll have the rib eye, bloody.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BARTENDER: Yes, ma'am. Rib eye, bloody.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Are you a professional?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: A professional what? You think I'm a prostitute? Mm. I'm not a professional anything. I just... Thought you looked sad. I like sad men.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I'm sorry to hear that.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: So... Other than drinking alone at bars...what do you do? For a living.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I'm between jobs at the moment.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: So what did you do?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: The only thing I was ever good at.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: Then why did you quit?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I'm trying to change.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: I know why you're sad now.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Do you?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: When you are that good at something, there are always going to be people who tempt you into staying the same.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: And how do you know so much about temptation?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: Buy me a glass of that scotch, and I'll tell you.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE:  Hello there. Hello?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM: I'm going to ask you a few questions. I want you to relax and answer them truthfully... Not that you'll have any choice about it. What is your name?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:  Sayid. Sayid Jarrah.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM: All right, Sayid. Why were you in handcuffs when we found you?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Because...because I am a bad man.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM: Were you running away from your people?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: What people?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM: The hostiles.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I am not a hostile.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: Then where did you come from, Sayid?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I came on a plane.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM: What plane?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Ajira flight 3-1-6. And that's how I returned to the island.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM: "Returned"? You've been here before?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Oh, yes. The first time, I was on Oceanic flight 8-1-5. It crashed. I was here for a hundred days. Then I left. Ask Sawyer.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM: Who's "Sawyer"?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 RADZINSKY: Who cares?! None of this matters. Ask him about the Flame.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE:  Quiet.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM: What do you know about our stations here?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I know the Flame was a communication station. The Pearl was to observe other stations. The Swan was to study electromagnetism. But, of course, that was before the incident--
Lost.Season05.Episode10 RADZINSKY:  The Swan?! How could he know what we were gonna name it? We haven't even built it yet! I told you! He saw the model! You see?! He is a spy!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE:  Hey!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 RADZINSKY: I knew it!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: Radzinsky! I'm not gonna tell you again. Cool it.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:  You're all going to die, you know.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE:  What?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: You're going to be killed.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: How exactly would you know this, Sayid?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Because I am from the future.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 OLDHAM:  Maybe I should've used half a dropper. Oops.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: You... You used exactly enough.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JULIET: Bench grinder, lube equipment, drill press over here. Plugs, bearings, sockets, ratchets here. How are you with a flat four engine? You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: No, not really.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JULIET:  It's okay. Jack told you about us...
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: No. Hurley, actually.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JULIET: It's kind of a relief, actually. I wasn't quite sure how to do it without it sounding like
I was telling you to stay away.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: It's fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE:  All right... What do we do with him?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 RADZINSKY: We kill him.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Hold on a second. We're not killing anyone, right?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: He violated the truce. What do you think they would do if they caught one of us?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Since when did we start acting like them? We're civilized.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HOACE: Yes, we are. We have a rule of law. And we've given him every opportunity to defend himself.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 RADZINSKY: Blah, blah, blah. Need I remind you, this man's seen things? He knows things. There's nothing to talk about. He's a spy.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: You sure about that, Stu? He was trying to escape from the hostiles. He obviously has problems with his people.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 RADZINSKY: Yeah, and sharing our secrets are the quickest way for him to solve those problems.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HOACE: Okay, I'm gonna need a little more time to consider.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 RADZINSKY:  Consider? I mean, the longer he's among us, the--the more danger we're in.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: I can talk to him, Horace. I just need more time.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 RADZINSKY:  No, you had your chance, LaFleur!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Why are we on your clock, Radzinsky?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 RADZINSKY: Horace, you've got to call for a vote.  Either we make a decision, or I call Ann Arbor...and they make it for us.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 AMY: Radzinsky's right. Horace, please...
Lost.Season05.Episode10 AMY: I can't... I can't sleep with one eye open. We have a baby now. We have to think about Ethan. We have to think about all the children here. How are we going to feel safe with this man around? I don't know what he's up to, but we can't keep him here. We have no choice.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: Okay. Let's put it to a vote. All in favor of Radzinsky's solution, raise your hand.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 RADZINSKY:  LaFleur?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HORACE: I would really like to say it's unanimous.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: Mmm. Just for the record, I really was just there for dinner.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Are you afraid I'll get the wrong idea?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Mmm.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: I think it's too late for that.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: Take it off.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: You so much as flinch, and you're dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: So who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: You asked me earlier if I was a professional. I am a professional. I was hired to bring you to Guam.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Who hired you?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: The family of Peter Avellino--the man you killed in cold blood last year on a golf course in the Seychelles.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: You're a bounty hunter?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: Doesn't matter what I am. You're going to answer for what you've done.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER:  Hit me in the face.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:  What?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Go on. You owe me one anyway, so make it a good one.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Then I want you to take these keys out of my pocket and let yourself out. The guard outside is Phil. He's a dimwit, so I reckon you can get his gun before he even realizes you're out. Just promise me you won't shoot him.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I appreciate the offer, but I'm fine right here.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: They're gonna kill you. They just took a vote. Even the new mom wants you dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I'm going to stay here, James.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: This morning, you were begging me to let you go. Why would you change your--
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:  Because...when I woke up in the jungle and I realized I was back on this island...I felt there was no purpose to it. But now I know exactly why I'm here.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: To get shot? Then what? You're out of your mind.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: Hi.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Why'd you come back?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Sayid just filled my ear full of some crap about his damn purpose, and I wanna know... Why'd y'all come back?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: Uh...
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Why, Kate?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: I don't know why everyone else came back. I just know why I did.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: What? What the hell?!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 KATE: Are you ok?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Craig! Grab a wrench, open those valves. Get the hoses going.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 MAN: Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 WOMAN: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Erin, grab the fire gear! Bill, go help Craig.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JACK:  What the hell happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Three years--no burning buses. Y'all are back for one day... Get on that hose.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER: Man this hose!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 MAN: Push it out!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAWYER:  All security! All security! This is LaFleur! We have a fire! Everyone get to building 15 now!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 PHIL:  Roger that. I'm on my way.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:  What happened to your glasses?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: My dad.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: For bringing me the sandwich? I know. My father was a hard man as well.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN:  I really hate it here. If I let you out...will you take me with you, to your people?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Yes, Ben, I will. That's why I'm here.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 TANNOY: Attention, passengers. Ajira Airways flight 3-16 to Honolulu and Guam...
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Are you sure we're going to Guam?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: Where else would we be going?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Can I ask you a favor? Can we get the next plane?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I'm very superstitious when it comes to flying.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: I'll buy you a rabbit's foot at the gift shop. This is the plane we're taking.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: Sorry about the handcuffs, but at least we're in business.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 BEN: Hold up! Wait, please! Thank you for not closing it.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 HURLEY: What's he doing here?! No, no, he can't come!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JACK: Hurley, hey, if you want to get back, this is how it's gonna have to be.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID:  Are you working for Benjamin Linus?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Are you working for him?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: Who's Benjamin Linus?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: He's a liar, a manipulator...a man who allowed his own daughter to be murdered to save himself... A monster responsible for nothing short of genocide.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 ILANA: Why would I work for somebody like that?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I did.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: Whoa! Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Hide!
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Jin?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JIN:  Sayid. What are you doing here? How did you get out?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: Sawyer let me go. They were going to kill me.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JIN: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 PHIL:  Attention. The prisoner escaped. The hostile is no longer in custody. Be on the lookout. He could be armed.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: They don't know he released me. Please, Jin, I need to keep moving.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 JIN: Okay. Let me talk to him first.  LaFleur, it's Jin here. Come in.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: Whoa! Where'd you learn to do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: Come on. We better go. He called LaFleur.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: You were right about me.
Lost.Season05.Episode10 YOUNG BEN: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode10 SAYID: I am a killer.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 PHIL:  Hello Jin?  Are you there?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 PHIL:  Jin?!  Can you hear me?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JIN:  Hello?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 PHIL:  Jin?  It's -- it's Phil, man.  Where have you been?  The hostile escaped.  We're searching the east grid.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JIN:  He's headed north.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 PHIL: [on walkie How the hell do you know that?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JIN: Because he attacked me. 
Lost.Season05.Episode11 PHIL:  What?  Where are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 PHIL:  Jin?! You still there?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 PHIL:  Jin!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 BEN:  Please help.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HORACE: Okay, everybody, listen up.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MAN: Put it over there.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HORACE: We don't know yet if another attack is coming.  So everybody needs to be ready for your security assignments.  Make sure you're in contact with your team leaders.  LaFleur's got search parties out, but the hostile's got a good jump on us.  We're pretty sure he used this fire as a diversion in order to escape.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: Uh...is he talking about Sayid?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK:  He was locked up.  How would he start the fire?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HORACE: Who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: Jack Shephard.  I'm...I'm new.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HORACE: Well, Jack, the way he started the fire is he had help, okay?  Somebody torched that van, and then that somebody let him out of his cell.  And since the security cameras didn't pick up any hostiles crossing the perimeter, that means it was one of us.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HORACE: Baxter, I want a full report on cleanup A.S.A.P.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 BAXTER: You got it Horace.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER:  Hey, you.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Yeah, you.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: You're in the motor pool, right?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Uh, yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Do you mind running that winch for me?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Okay, no worries.  Just throw this lever.  When I tell you to stop... just pull it up.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: All right.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: See?  Simple.  Don't do it till I'm ready.  All right, crank her up.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Okay.  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: So they just stuck you in the motor pool when you got here?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Yeah, pretty much.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Yeah, same thing happened to me.    Wait, hold.  Hold it right there.  That's good.  Right there.  That's good.    I guess they couldn't sucker anybody into getting on that sub if they told us we were gonna be grease monkeys and janitors.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE:  Well, ya gotta start somewhere.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: What's your name?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: I'm Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Welcome aboard, Kate.  I'm Roger.  Roger Linus.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: It's nice to meet you, Roger.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: That's my kid.    That's my kid!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Hi, handsome.  Did you have a good sleep?  Yeah, that's my boy.   Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, never let it fade away.    Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket  save it for a rainy day.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Hi.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: Oh, my God!  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE  Hi, Cassidy.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: Oh, my God!  I saw you on the news!  I told all my friends, "I know that woman!"   Hi!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: This is Aaron.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: Hi, Aaron.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Say hi.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: You survived a plane crash.    It's amazing.  I never thought I'd see you again.  What are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Sawyer sent me.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY:  Sawyer.  So that son of a bitch is still alive?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: He was when I left.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: And he asked you to come here and give me an envelope full of money?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Well, he -- he told me where to find you, and...said to take care of Clementine...his daughter?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: Well, she's asleep in her crib right now.  Want me to wake her up?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE:  I, uh, shouldn't have bothered you.  I could've sent it, and I probably should have.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: Why did you tell me all this?  Why'd you trust me?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Because I thought your daughter had a right to know that her father cared.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: Why didn't he come back with the rest of you?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: The helicopter that we were on was running out of gas, so he jumped so that we could make it to the boat.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY:   What a coward.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: He was trying to do the right thing.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: He was trying to get away from you.  I told him he had a daughter.  He never so much as lifted a finger to try to call her.  So now I'm supposed to think he's a hero because he told you to come here and help us?  Hell, I bet this money's not even his, is it?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: They gave us a settlement after the crash, and I didn't need it all--
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: You don't have to explain it, Kate.  You got the same look on your face I did when he ditched me.  All I have for you is sympathy.  Is it his?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: Your son.  Is it Sawyer's?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: No. No, I was pregnant before I met him.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: That's not your baby, is it?  Kate, you just told me that you and your friends cooked a story for the whole world about what happened on that island.  So you tell me the truth about that?  Why are you lying to me about him?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Because I have to.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: What the hell are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: That was Ben.  That kid who was shot was Ben.  Was it Sayid?  Did he shoot him?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Here's what you need to do, Kate--Keep your mouth shut and stop asking questions.  'Cause putting any attention on yourself is the last thing I need right now.  Now scram.  I don't want you around here.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: I just wanna know what's going on.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HORACE:  LaFleur.   What...  What, uh... What's she doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: This is, uh...
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: I'm Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Kate.  She's new over at the motor pool.  I was seeing if she saw anything suspicious, but she didn't, so...you can run along, thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HORACE: Have you checked out the hostile's cell yet?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: I was a little busy trying to keep the town from burnin' down, Horace.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HORACE: Okay.  Well, then let's do it.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HORACE: He didn't break out.  Somebody let him out.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER:  These are janitor's keys.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HORACE: We've only got three janitors.  There's Roger, Willie and, uh, that new guy.  I just met him.  His name's Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Yeah.  I just brought him in from the sub.  I'll go talk to him.  Miles, you wanna come with me? 
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: Yeah, sure, boss. 
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER:   All right,I want you to find Jack and Hurley and Kate as quick as you can.  Put 'em in a house and sit on 'em.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: What for?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: 'Cause I don't want 'em talking to anybody else.  Things are starting to spin out of control here.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: All right, I got it.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: All right, go.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Who did this?  Do you know who did this to my son?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Not yet, but we're working on it.  How's he doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: I don't know.  Juliet told me to wait out here.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Let me see if I can get an update for ya.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Thanks, Jim.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER:  Roger?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Yeah?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: You happen to have your keys with you?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER:  Yeah.  Why?  What do you need?   I must've left them at...at the house.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: It's all right.  Don't you worry about it.  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: More gauze.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 NURSE: Here's some gauze.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Yeah, right here.  Yeah.   If we can't stop the hemorrhaging, we're gonna have to pack the whole tract.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 NURSE: Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER:   Where's the doctor?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET:   At the Looking Glass station til Friday.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: How is he doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Not well.   Hold on.   He's still bleeding in there somewher, and I can't fix it.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: It's all right.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: No, it's not all right.  Someone needs to get in there who can find the damage that bullet did and fix it.   He needs a real surgeon.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: You're telling us we're under house arrest?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: No, you're all free to leave whenever you want...but I'll shoot you in the leg.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK:   And whose idea was this?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: Who do you think?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Sawyer's just doing his job, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: What the hell are you doing, Tubby?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: Checking to see if I'm disappearing.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: "Back to the Future", man.  We came back in time to the island and changed stuff.  So if little Ben dies, he'll never grow up to be big Ben, who's the one who made us come back here in the first place.  Which means we can't be here.  And therefore, dude?  We don't exist.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: You're an idiot.  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: Am I?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: Yeah.  It doesn't work like that.  You can't change anything.  Your maniac Iraqi buddy shot Linus.  That is what always happened.  It's just...we never experienced how it all turns out.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: This is really confusing.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: Yeah, well, get used to it.  But the good news is that Linus didn't die, so that means the kid can't either.  He'll be fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Didn't look like he was gonna be fine.  What if you're wrong?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: Well, if I'm wrong, then I guess we all stop existing, and none of it matters anyway then, does it?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Doc, I need you to come with me.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: Come with you where?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Juliet said the kid's losing blood, and we ain't gone none to put back in him.  So we need you to show us where he sprung a leak.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK:   No.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: No, I'm not coming with you.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: If you don't come with me, Jack, that kid's gonna die.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK:   Then he dies.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: Making some sandwiches.  I figured everybody'd be getting hungry by now. 
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: He's just a boy, Jack.  You can't just let him die.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: You heard Miles.  We can't change what's already happened.  This has nothing to do with me.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Unless you're the one who's supposed to save him.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: 30 years from now, that boy's gonna be a man...that locks me in a cage because he needs surgery.  And then you're gonna come in and you're gonna beg me to operate on him because he's threatening to murder Sawyer.  I've already done this once.   I've already saved Benjamin Linus, and I did it for you, Kate.  I don't need to do it again.  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: This is our fault.  We brought Sayid back.  We caused this.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: You know, when we were here before, I spent all of my time trying to fix things.  But...did you ever think that maybe the island just wants to fix things itself?  And maybe I was just...getting' in the way?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: You know, I don't like the new you.  I liked the old you, who wouldn't just sit around and wait for things to happen.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK:  You didn't like the old me, Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: Hey!  Where are you going?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET:   Just try to relax.  You're okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 NURSE: I'm sorry.  Juliet?  One of the new people is here.    She heard Ben needed blood. Says she's a universal donor.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: This might hurt for a second.    Good.   Very brave.    So James told me that Jack wouldn't help, but he didn't say why.  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: If I understood why Jack does what he does, I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting here.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Off island, did something happen with you two?  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: We were engaged.  Does that count?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: What's going on?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Roger, I asked you to wait outside.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: No, what's going on with my kid?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Kate is giving us some fresh blood so we can transfuse Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Well, I'm not waitin' outside.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: You know, he could stay with me, and you could check on Ben, and--and Roger here could keep me company, make sure I don't pass out.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Okay.  Roger, have a seat.  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Sure.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER:   He stole my keys.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Sorry?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: LaFleur asked me where my keys were.  That bastard doesn't ask any questions he doesn't know the answers to...which means my son stole my keys so he could bust that animal out of jail.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Why--why would he do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Because of me.  You got kids?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: I thought I was gonna be the greatest father ever.  You know?   I guess it didn't work out that way.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: What about his mother?  Is she still around?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: No, she's dead.  She died the day he was born.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER:  Yeah, me, too.  I tried to do what I thought she'd want me to do, but...I guess a boy just needs his mother.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER:  What's going on?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: He's going into hypoxic shock.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: What does that mean?!  What's the matter with him?!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: He needs more oxygen.  Roger, get out of here!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET:  Get him out of here!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Wait!  What--what is--wait a minute.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Please, Roger.  Just wait outside.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: Let me get this straight.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: All this already happened.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: So this conversation we're having right now...we already had it.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES:  Yes!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: Then what am I gonna say next?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: I don't know. 
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: Ha!  Then your theory is wrong!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: For the thousandth time, you dingbat, the conversation already happened, but not for you and me.  For you and me, it's happening right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: Okay, answer me this.  If all this already happened to me, then...why don't I remember any of it?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: Because once Ben turned that wheel, time isn't a straight line for us anymore.  Our experiences in the past and the future occurred before these experiences right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: Say that again.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES:   Shoot me.  Please.  Please!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: Aha!  I can't shoot you.  Because if you die in 1977, then you'll never come back to the island on the freighter 30 years from now.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: I can die because I've already come to the island on the freighter.  Any of us can die because this is our present.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: But you said Ben couldn't die because he still has to grow up and become the leader of the Others.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: Because this is his past.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: But when we first captured Ben, and Sayid, like, tortured him, then why wouldn't he remember getting shot by that same guy when he was a kid?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: Huh.  I hadn't thought of that.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: Huh.  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: How is he?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: He's stable.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Is he gonna be okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: He's got some fresh blood running through him, which is a good thing.  Roger, I need you to go out to the medical station.  There are some supplies there that we don't have here .
Lost.Season05.Episode11 ROGER: Okay.  Hey, I just wanna say, I-I... I wanna say thanks.  I know that you're doing everything you can...  to save him, and...all right, I'm--I'm gonna go, okay? 
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Is he any better?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: He's stable now.  But I can't, um... I can't fix it.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: What about the sub?  I mean, can we take him somewhere?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: No.  It's gone.  It won't be back for a couple of months.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: But he can't die, right?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: He is going to die.  He is in a medical situation that is not resolveable.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Okay, well, we can't just sit here and do nothing.  I mean, there's got to be someone who can help him.  We have an entire c...  What?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Maybe there's something they can do.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: They?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: The Others.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: You got him?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Yeah.  Ready?  Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: All right.  One, two, three, go.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Okay, let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: I'm coming with you.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: No, no, no, no.  If something goes wrong or we get caught, it doesn't matter for me, but you've got a whole life here.  And besides, if Sawyer knew that I got you involved in this, he'd kill me.  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: How are you gonna manage?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE:  I'll manage, don't worry. 
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Kate.   Sawyer's gonna find out Ben's gone, and when he does, I have to tell him what happened.  But I'll give you as much of a head start as I can.  Good luck.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 BEN: There's someone...someone here in Los Angeles.  Let me take you to them.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SUN: Who?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 BEN: The same person that's gonna show us how to get back to the island.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE:  Is that what this is about?   You knew about this.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: No.  No, I was o--
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: And that is why you were pretending to care about Aaron, to convince me to go back there?!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: I wasn't pretending anything.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: This is insane.  You guys are crazy.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: Kate--
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Jack, don't!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 AARON: Mommy, I'm thirsty.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 AARON: I need some milk.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 WOMAN:  Price check on 2.  Price check on 2.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE:   Do you want chocolate milk or regular milk?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 AARON: Juice box.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: You don't want milk anymore?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 AARON: Juice box.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Um...excuse me.  Where are your juice boxes?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 EMPLOYEE: Aisle 5.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Thank you very much.   Aaron?    Um, excuse me.  Have you seen my son?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 EMPLOYEE: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: A little 3-year-old blond?   Aaron?  Aaron?  Aaron?!  Aaron!    Excuse me.  I've lost my son.  He's 3.  He's a little blond boy.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MANAGER: Don't worry, ma'am.  I'll make an announcement.  No, no, no.  You have to seal off the store.  You...   Aaron?  Hey!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 WOMAN: Hey, is this your mommy?  Honey, is this your mommy?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 WOMAN: I found him in the fruit section.  I--he looked lost, I was getting eading to make an announcement.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE:  It's okay, honey.  Mommy's got you.  Mommy's got you.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 BEN:  Um... tell my...
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Try not to talk, okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 BEN: Tell my dad I'm sorry I stole his keys.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: I know you gotta stop me...but I can't just let that kid die.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER:   Damn it, Freckles.  I ain't here to stop you.  I'm here to help you.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CLEMENTINE: Hi, Auntie Kate!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Hi, Clementine.  Is your mommy home?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CLEMENTINE: Sure.  I'll go get her.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: They're going back?  To the island?    Why in God's name would they wanna do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: I don't know.  Jack says that we weren't supposed to leave.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: Well, Jack sounds like a piece of work.  You look exhausted.  Drink this.  Turl up on my bed.  Take a nap.  I'll watch your fella.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: I lost him.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE:  I don't know what happened.  We were in the supermarket, and I turned around for one second, and he was gone.    And, you know, the crazy thing is, is that... as scared as I was...I wasn't surprised.  All I could think was, it's about time.  Why would I feel that way?  I mean, why would I expect him to be taken?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: Because you took him, Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: No, I...Claire was gone.  I mean, she left him.  I had to take him.  He needed me.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CASSIDY: You needed him.  Sawyer broke your heart.  How else were you supposed to fix it?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Figure out how you were gonna carry him out there by yourself?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Well, the line's just right over there, right?  The Others are on the other side.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Well, they ain't right on the other side.  We better get movin'.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Hey.  Why are you doing this?  Why are you helping me?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER:   When I found out Ben was gone, and Juliet told me what you were up to, I asked that exact damn question.  Why are you helping Ben?  And she said...no matter what he's gonna grow up to be, it's wrong to let a kid die.   So...that's why I'm doing this.  I'm doing it for her.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Where's Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: Uh he--he's in the shower.  I think.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 HURLEY: Is he in trouble?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: I just need to talk to him.  You two mind giving us some privacy?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MILES: Hey, ask me more questions about time travel.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: I needed you.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: That kid was bleeding out.  You're a surgeon, and I needed you.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: That kid is Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: That's not Ben yet.  He's just a kid.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: Juliet, I'm sorry.  I can't help you.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: I'm not asking for your help, Jack.  You made it pretty clear you weren't interested.  It's up to Sawyer and Kate now.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: She's trying to save him,  and I sent James after her to help, because they actually care.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: I came back here because I care, Juliet.  I came back here because I was trying to save you.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: We didn't need saving.  We've been fine for three years.  You came back here for you.  At least do me the courtesy of telling me why.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK: I came back...because I was supposed to.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Supposed to do what?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JACK:   I don't know yet.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 JULIET: Well, you'd better figure it out.  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: You know, I can take him for a while.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER:  Sure you can.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: You know, his father said that you think Ben broke Sayid out.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Kid'll do almost anything if he's pissed off enough at his folks.  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Is that why you asked me to take care of your daughter?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Did you?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Of course I did.  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: What's she like?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Clementine?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Yeah, Clementine.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Oh, she's beautiful.  Looks just like you when she smiles.  She's growing up fast.  Already has a little attitude.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: I bet you and Cassidy had a lot to talk about.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: She had an interesting theory on why you jumped off the chopper.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Yeah, what's that?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: She thought you were worried about what would happen if you didn't.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: You and me would've never worked out, Kate.  I wasn't any more fit to be your boyfriend than I am to be that little girl's father.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: You seem to be doing all right with Juliet.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Yeah.  I've done a lot of growing up the past three years.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MAN: Hands up!
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MAN: Do not move.  I said don't move.  This is a violation of the truce.  You're over the line.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: We know.  This kid's been shot.  That's both of our problems.  So unless you want to go to war, you're gonna take us to Richard Alpert, and you're gonna do it now.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Mrs. Littleton.  I'm Kate Austen.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CAROLE: I know who you are.  Come in.  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CAROLE: Your friend, Dr. Shephard came here last night, going on and on about some person named Aaron.  When I asked him who that was, he ran out of here like the room was on fire.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: He's your grandson.    And your daughter, Claire...is alive.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CAROLE: What are you talking about?  Claire died in the plane crash.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: No, she survived.  When we crashed, your daughter was eight months pregnant, and...she's the one who gave birth on the island, not me.  We lied.  There were other survivors, too.  We just left them behind.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CAROLE: Why?  Why would you leave her there?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Because she disappeared, and she left the baby behind.  We looked everywhere, but...that's when I started taking care of Aaron.  And when we were rescued, we didn't--we had to decide what to do with him.  And I knew that she had wanted him to be adopted, but I couldn't.  I had to protect him, so I said he was mine.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CAROLE: Why did you lie?  Why didn't you come to me in the first place?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Because I needed him.   I'm sorry.  You're gonna see that he's so sweet  and kind and good.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CAROLE: Where is he?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Um, I checked in two doors down.  He's asleep.  I know that this is a lot for you to handle.  But...when you're ready, he's waiting for you.  I told him that you're his grandmother.  That you'll take care of him while I'm gone and that I'll be back soon.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 CAROLE: Where are you going?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: I'm going back to find your daughter.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE:  Bye-bye, baby. 
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Don't worry.  We got 'em right where we want 'em.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MAN: Shut up and keep moving'.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: What's it look like I'm doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 RICHARD: Hello there, James. 
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: Where the hell did you come from?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 RICHARD: You asked my people to bring you to me.  Here I am.    Is that Benjamin Linus?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: You two know each other?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 RICHARD: What happened to him?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: He was shot.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 RICHARD:  And who might you be?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER: She's with me.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 RICHARD: And why are you here?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: 'Cause we need you to save his life.  Can you?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 RICHARD: If I take him, he's not ever gonna be the same again.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: What do you mean by that?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 RICHARD: What I mean is that, he'll forget this ever happened, and that...his innocence will be gone.  He will always be one of us.  You still want me to take him?
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 MAN:  Richard... You shouldn't do this without asking Ellie.  And if Charles finds out--
Lost.Season05.Episode11 RICHARD: Let him find out.  I don't answer to either of them
Lost.Season05.Episode11 KATE: Wh-where are you taking him?  
Lost.Season05.Episode11 SAWYER:  Come on.
Lost.Season05.Episode11 LOCKE: Hello, Ben.  Welcome back to the land of the living.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN:  What have you done, Richard?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 RICHARD: Calm down.  Calm down.  This has nothing to do with you.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: So it's true?  You actually brought one of them to our Temple?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 RICHARD: He's just a boy, and he was dying.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: Then you should've let him die.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 RICHARD: Jacob wanted it done.  The Island chooses who the Island chooses.  You know that.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: Yes.  Yes, of course.  What's his name?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: Hello, Benjamin.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 YOUNG BEN: What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: You were injured.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 YOUNG BEN: How?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: You don't remember?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 YOUNG BEN: Where am I?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: You're among friends.  We're going to take care of you.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 YOUNG BEN: My dad -- Is he here?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: You'll be back to him soon enough.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 YOUNG BEN: No.  No, I don't want to go back.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: Okay, easy.  Easy.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 YOUNG BEN: Oh!    I don't want to go back.    I wanna stay.  I wanna be one of you.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: Just because you're living with them doesn't mean you can't be one of us.  You should be dead, Benjamin.  But this Island... it saved your life.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 YOUNG BEN: Who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: I'm Charles.  Charles Widmore.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Hello, Ben.  Welcome back to the land of the living.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN:  My God.  You're alive.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Yes, I am.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: I knew it.  I knew that this would happen.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Then why are you so surprised to see me?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN:  Because it's one thing to believe it, John.  It's another thing to see it.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Then why were you trying to run away to the main Island?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: I broke the rules, John.  I came back to the Island.  I was going to answer for what I'd done.  I was going back... to be judged.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE:  Judged?   By whom?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Well, J-John, we don't even have a word for it, but I believe you call it the Monster.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ILANA: Morning.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Hello. What's in the crate?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ILANA: Just some stuff we need to get moved.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Need a hand?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BRAM: Oh, thanks.  We got it.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Okay.  Have a great day.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CEASAR: How you feeling, my friend?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Like someone hit me with an oar, but I'll live.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR:  What do you make of him?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: I'm not sure.  What has he told you?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: When you were out cold, he was watching over you.  And he said you killed him.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: I killed him?  Really?  'Cause he looks fine to me.   You know, I don't really remember him from the plane.  Do you?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: No, I don't.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: What if... he was already here, before we crashed?  If he thinks I killed him, then he's insane.  We may be dealing with a man who's dangerously deranged.  Then the question is, what are we gonna do about it?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: Don't worry, my friend.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: I have your back.  Caesar.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Pleasure to meet you, Caesar.  I'm Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 TEENAGER: You want me to do it?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Shh.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 TEENAGER: I can do it if you want me to, Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN:  Shut up!  And stay here, Ethan.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Don't!  Don't do it.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ROUSSEAU: You're the one who infected us, aren't you?! C'est vous qui nous avez infectés!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ROUSSEAU: Non!  Non!  Rendez-moi mon bébé!  Non!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Shh.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ROUSSEAU: Rendez-moi mon bébé!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: It's okay.  It's okay, baby.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ROUSSEAU: Ne l'infectez pas, lui aussi!  Please, don't take my Alex!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Do you want your baby to live?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ROUSSEAU: Why are you taking her?!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Be grateful you're still alive.  Now you listen to me.  If you try to follow me or if you ever come looking for me, I'll kill you.  And if you want your child to live, every time you hear whispers, you run the other way.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: What's that?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Just something sentimental.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: So this is your old office, huh?  I never pictured you leading your people from behind a desk.  It seems a little...  corporate.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Was there something that you needed, John?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Well, Ben, I was hoping that you and I could talk about the elephant in the room.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: I assume you're referring to the fact that I killed you.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Yeah.  
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: It was the only way to get you back to the Island, along with as many of those who left as possible.  You do remember, John--that's why you left in the first place, to convince 'em to come back?  But you failed.  And the only way to bring them together was by your death, and you understood that.  It's why you were about to kill yourself when I stopped you.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: If all I had to do was die, Ben, they why did you stop me?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: You had critical information that would've died with you.  And once you'd given it to me... well, I just didn't have time to talk you back into hanging yourself.  So I took a shortcut.  And look at you, John.  I was right.  You're here.  You're back.  So are the rest of them.  I don't know where yet exactly, but they came.  It worked.  And that's why I did it, because it was in the best interests of the Island. 
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE:  I was just hoping for an apology.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: I've decided to help you, Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Help me do what?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Do what you say you are on your way to do.  Be judged.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: That's not something you want to see, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: If everything you've done has been in the best interests of the Island...  then I'm sure the Monster will understand. Let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: Hey!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: What are you doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: We're taking a boat.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: Where?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Over to the main Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: I don't think so, my friend.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Are these your boats?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: Are they yours?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Caesar, right?  I was under the impression these were found here, so I'm just gonna borrow one.  I'm happy to leave the other boat for you in case you want to follow us.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: "Us"?  Are you going with him?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: He didn't really give me a choice.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: I'm sorry, but I'm calling the shots here, and I say you are not taking anything.  What you are going to do is to sit down and tell us how you know so much about this Island, my friend.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: You're in the habit of calling people "friend", but I don't think you mean it.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: Step away from the boat.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: No.  I'm not gonna step away from the boat.  I'm gonna take it, and you're gonna let me, my friend.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CAESAR: You're not taking anything.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: You looking for this?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: This gentleman and I are taking a boat.  Does anyone else have a problem with that?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Consider that my apology.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Home sweet home.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Looks like we're not the first ones who decided to tie up here.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: That would be Sun and Lapidus.  I showed 'em where the boats were, and Sun thanked me by smashing me on the head with a paddle.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Oh.  Is she the one that hurt your arm?  I noticed you were favoring it on the way over.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: No.  Someone else hurt my arm.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: You just make friends everywhere you go, don't ya?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Well, I've found sometimes that friends can be significantly more dangerous than enemies, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Is that why you shot an unarmed man in the chest?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: The man was unarmed because I'd stolen his gun--the gun he was going to use to kill you.  I couldn't let that happen.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: No sense in me dying twice, right?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: You're welcome.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: We're going to your old house, aren't we?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Yes.  It's the only place I can summon it... the "monster."  Once it arrives, I'll either be forgiven... or I won't.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: I think you're lying.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Lying about what?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: That you want to be judged for leaving the Island and coming back because it's against the rules.  I don't think you care about rules.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Then what do I want to be judged for, John?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: For killing your daughter.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: Well?  Did you do it?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: We had a...
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: ...complication.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: I'm sorry. Is that a... baby?  Your orders were to exterminate that woman.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Why?  She's no threat to us.  She's insane, Charles.  Besides, you didn't tell me she had a child.  What was it I was supposed to do?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CHARLES: Kill it.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: It's not an "it".  This is a child.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: You might find this difficult to understand, Benjamin... every decision I've made has been about protecting this Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Is killing this baby what Jacob wants?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Then here she is.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: You do it.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: So whose idea was it to move into these houses?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Well, your people were living in the jungle.  And then after you murdered the DHARMA folk, you relocated here.  I just wondered if it was your idea.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Do you disapprove, John?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: It just doesn't seem like something the Island would want.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: You don't have the first idea what this Island wants.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Are you sure about that?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: That was your house, wasn't it?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Yes, and that's Alex's room.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Well, I suppose you better go over there and check it out.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Sun?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LAPIDUS:  What are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: This used to be my house.  I saw a light turned on.  What are the two of you doing in here?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: That was taken in 1977.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Are you trying to tell me that your friends were in the DHARMA Initiative?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: You don't know about this?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Of course not.  Where did you get this?  Who gave this to you?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LAPIDUS: We met some crazy old man outside.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: He said his name was Christian.  He told us to come in here and wait.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Wait for what?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: He said if I ever wanted to see my husband again, I had to wait here for John Locke.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LAPIDUS: But considering he's dead, we ain't holding our breath.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Well, you might want to look outside.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: What you're saying, it's... impossible.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: But here I am.  I don't know how, I don't know why, but I'm sure there's a very good reason for it.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LAPIDUS: As long as the dead guy says there's a reason, well, then I guess everything's gonna be just peachy.  And forget about the fact that the rest of your people are supposedly 30 years ago... now the only ones who are here to help us are a murderer and a guy who can't seem to remember how the hell he got out of a coffin.  Sun, please, let's just go back to the plane, see if I can fix the radio, and maybe we can get some help.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: If you leave with him, you'll never find your husband again.  I'm all the help you need.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: Are you saying you know how to find them?  How to find Jin?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: I have some ideas.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LAPIDUS: I'm sorry to say, but I'm leaving with or without you.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: If there's any chance of finding my husband, then I have to stay.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LAPIDUS: All right.  Well, for God sake, watch your back.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: All right.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: How do we find Jin?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Ben has something to do first.  Isn't that right, Ben?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Yes, John.  That's right.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Better get to it then.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: I'll be outside.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ALEX: Again, Daddy!  Again!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Okay.  Okay. 
Lost.Season05.Episode12 RICHARD: Wow, Alex!  Any higher, and you're gonna fly right off the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 RICHARD:  The sub's about to leave.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ALEX: Higher, Daddy!  Higher!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: All right.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 RICHARD: You don't have to see him off, Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Yes, Richard, I do.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ALEX: Higher!  Higher, Daddy!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Charles!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: I came to say good-bye.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE:  No, you didn't.  You came to gloat.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: No, don't act as if I wanted this.  You brought this on yourself.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: Are you quite certain you want to do this, Benjamin?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: You left the Island regularly.  You had a daughter with an outsider.  You broke the rules, Charles.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: And what makes you think you deserve to take what's mine?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Because I won't be selfish.  Because I'll sacrifice anything to protect this Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: You wouldn't sacrifice Alex.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: You're the one who wanted her dead, Charles, not the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: I hope you're right, Benjamin, because if you aren't, and it is the Island that wants her dead, she'll be dead.  And one day, you'll be standing where I'm standing now.  You'll be the one being banished, and then you'll finally realize that you cannot fight the inevitable.  I'll be seeing you, boy.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Where did John go?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: He said he had something to do.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Did he say what it was?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: No, I didn't ask.  Jack must have lied.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: About Locke being dead?  I don't know why he would, but that's the only explanation.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Jack didn't lie.  John was dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: Just because he was in a coffin doesn't mean that he couldn't have faked his dea--
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN:  Trust me.  I'm sure.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: So you knew this would happen to Locke if we brought him back here?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Sun, I had no idea it would happen.  I've seen this Island do miraculous things.  I've seen it heal the sick, but never once has it done anything like this.  Dead is dead.  You don't get to come back from that, not even here.  So the fact that John Locke is walking around this Island... scares the living hell out of me.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: You may want to go inside.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Because what's about to come out of that jungle is something I can't control.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Any luck?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: It hasn't shown up yet.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Last time we didn't have to wait this long.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: It's not a train, John.  It doesn't run on a schedule.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Well, if it's not gonna come to us, then... I suppose we'll have to go to it.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: It doesn't work that way.  I only know how to summon it.  I don't know where it actually is.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: I do.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: It's weird for me, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: I realize how strange this all is--me, here.  But I assure you, Sun, I'm the same man I've always been.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE:  Are you ready?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Lead the way.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: Hello?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Charles?  It's Benjamin.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: How did you get this number?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Doesn't matter.  What matters is I'm going back to the Island today.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: The Island won't let you come back, trust me.  I've spent almost 20 years trying to return.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Well, Charles, where you failed, I'm going to succeed... just as soon as I do one thing.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: And what's that, Benjamin?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Kill your daughter.  In fact, I'm looking at Our Mutual Friend right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: I don't know what you're talking about.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: It's the name of the boat that Penny's on.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE: Don't you dare.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Good-bye, Charles.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: May I ask you a question, John?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Shoot.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: How is it that you know where you're going?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: I just know.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: I mean, how does that work, exactly?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: How does what work?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: The knowing.  I mean, did it come upon you gradually, or did you wake up one morning suddenly understanding the mysteries of the universe?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: You don't like this, do you?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Having to ask questions that you don't know the answers to, blindly following someone in the hopes that they'll lead you to whatever it is you're looking for.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: No, John, I don't like it at all.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Well, now you know what it was like to be me.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: We should keep moving.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Yes, we should.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: I think I know where we're going now, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Do you?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: It's the same place they brought me as a child.  It's where the Island healed me.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Well... let's hope it's as generous this time around.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: What is it?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: It's the wall around our Temple.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: What Temple?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: About a half mile from here.  We built this wall to keep people like the two of you from ever seeing it.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: We're not going into your Temple, Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: We're going under it.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: After you.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: I need to ask a favor of you, Sun.  If you can ever get off this Island, find Desmond Hume for me.  Tell him I said I was sorry.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 SUN: Sorry for what?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN:  He'll know.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 DESMOND: Hey!  What are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 PENNY: Desmond!  Desmond!  Des?!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Don't move.  Not another word.  Hello, Penelope.  My name is Benjamin Linus.  I'm sorry that you're caught up in the middle of this thing, but your father--
Lost.Season05.Episode12 PENNY: My father and I have absolutely no relationship whatsoever, so whatever--
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Your father is a really terrible human being.  He's responsible for the killing of my daughter.  That's why I'm here.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CHARLIE: Mommy!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 PENNY:  Charlie, go back inside, babe.  Go back inside.  Please.  Please, whatever you do, don't hurt my son.  Please don't hurt my son.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 CHARLIE: Mommy?  Mommy?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 PENNY: Charlie, go inside!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 DESMOND: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: Captain Lapidus!  Captain Lapidus!  You're back.  Thank God.  They found guns.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LAPIDUS: What are you talking about?  Who found guns?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 MAN: Ilana and three of the others.  They said they were in charge now.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LAPIDUS: Where are they?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LAPIDUS: Ilana!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LAPIDUS: What's going on?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ILANA: What lies in the shadow of the statue?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LAPIDUS: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BRAM: Answer the question!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ILANA: What lies in the shadow of the statue?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LAPIDUS: I have no idea what the--
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ILANA:  Get everyone else.  Tell them it's time.  And tie him up.  He's coming with us.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: You know, you were right.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: About what?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Why I need to be judged.  When Charles Widmore's men came, they gave me a choice.  Either leave the Island or let my daughter die.  All I had to do was walk out of the house and go with them.  But I didn't do it.  So you were right.  John, I did kill Alex.  And now I have to answer for that.  I appreciate you showing me the way, but I think I can take it from here.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: You got it.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: I'll meet you outside, if I live--Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Ben!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Are you all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN:  Never better.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: Hang on.  I'll find something to get you out of there.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: John, wait!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN'S VOICE: You didn't tell me she had a child.  What was it I was supposed to do?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 WIDMORE'S VOICE: Kill it.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN'S VOICE: It's not an "it."  This is a child.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ALEX'S VOICE: Higher!  Again, Daddy!  Again!   Higher!  Higher, Daddy!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ALEX'S VOICE: I hate you!  I hate your guts!  I wish you were dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ALEX'S VOICE: These people--you said they're dangerous.  More dangerous than you?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ALEX'S VOICE:  Dad, they're serious.  They killed Karl and my mother.  Please, Dad.  Help me!
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN'S VOICE: She's not my daughter.  She means nothing to me.  So if you wanna kill her, go ahead and--
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ALEX: Daddy?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Alex.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ALEX: Hi, Dad.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Ohh, Alex.  I'm so, so sorry.  It was all my fault.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ALEX: I know.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ALEX: Listen to me, you bastard!  I know that you're already planning to kill John again, and I want you to know that if you so much as touch him, I will hunt you down and destroy you.  You will listen to every word John Locke says, and you will follow his every order.  Do you understand?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 ALEX: Say it!  Say you'll follow him.
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: Yes, I will.  I'll follow him.  I swear. 
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE:  Ben?  Ben!  Ben?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 LOCKE: What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode12 BEN: It let me live.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 TREVOR: Comes fully equipped.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 TREVOR: I'm telling you, it's a steal at $400.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 TREVOR: What, you gotta check with your husband?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 WOMAN: It's just me.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 BOY: Mommy?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 BOY: Can I have a quarter for the vending machine?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 WOMAN: Honey, I said wait for me by the pool.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 TREVOR: I thought you said it was "just me."
Lost.Season05.Episode13 WOMAN: I meant my husband's out of the picture.  It's just me and my son.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 TREVOR:  I don't know.  Most of the other tenants--they don't like noise.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 WOMAN: He's very quiet.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 TREVOR: I'm gonna need two months up front.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 WOMAN: Here, honey.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 WOMAN: Hey, no running!  You hear me, Miles?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Mom!  Mommy!  Help!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Mommy!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: Miles?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: Miles, what happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Mommy!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 TREVOR: Oh, God.  Mr. Vonner.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: What were you doing in here?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: He... he was all alone.  He was scared.  His chest hurt.  He kept calling out for Kimberly.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 TREVOR: Kimberly?  That's his wife.  No, she died last year.  Now, how would you know that?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I heard him.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: Miles, what are you talking about?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: He's still talking right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: Honey... he's dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I told you!  I can hear him!  I can hear him!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER:  Miles, you there?  Pick up.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Jim, where the hell are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: I'll fill you in later.  Right now I need you to take care of something.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Like what?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: The security tapes from the pylon camera feeds.  They need to accidentally get erased.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Erased?  Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: I ain't got time for questions, Miles.  Just do it.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Okay.  Okay.  Uh, which ones?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Look on your monitors.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: You see us?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Yeah.  You're on number 4.  Is that Kate?  What the hell are you doing out there?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Just erase number 4.  And if anyone asks, I'm off the grid.  I'm looking for the escaped Hostile.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: You mean your pal Sayid?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Damn it, Miles!  You gonna help me or not?!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Yeah, yeah.  I got it.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: All right. I owe you one.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER:  All right, I want you to go back and and find Juliet, see if anyone's noticed yet if Little Ben's gone missin'.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE: What are you gonna do when they find out?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Do my best to cover it up.  In case you haven't noticed,  I'm Head of Security.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: All right, I'll see you back there.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HORACE: Where's LaFleur?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Uh, he's, uh, out looking for the escaped prisoner.  I tried to get him on his walkie, but...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Uh, he must be out of range.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HORACE:  Damn it.  All right.  Then it's gonna have to be you.  Jim already knows about this, but I'm gonna bring you into the circle of trust.  Can I trust you, Miles?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES:  Absolutely, Horace.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HORACE: Okay.  Good.  I need you to take this out to Radzinsky at grid 3-34.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HORACE: He's gonna give you something in return.  I want you to bring it back to me with no questions asked.  You understand?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Um... we're not supposed to be in 3-3-4.  Isn't that Hostile territory?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HORACE: Welcome to the circle of trust.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 RADZINSKY: Stop right there!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 RADZINSKY: Miles?!  What are you doing out here?!  I was expecting LaFleur.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES:  LaFleur's busy.  Horace sent me instead.  I'm in the circle of trust.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 RADZINSKY: Get out!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I'm supposed to give you this.  And he said you had something for me.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: What happened to him?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 RADZINSKY: He had an accident.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: What kind of accident?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 RADZINSKY: He fell into a ditch.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Is that a bullet hole in his head?  The ditch had a gun?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 RADZINSKY:  It doesn't matter what happened to him... because knowing that is not your job--your job is to do what I tell you to.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 RADZINSKY: Take him back to Horace now, Miles.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES:  Okay... so what really happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I need to see her.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Ma?    It's me.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA:  Miles.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES:  I'm--I'm sorry that...  I couldn't make it by sooner.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: It's okay.  You're here now.  Why did you come, Miles?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I need you to tell me why I'm this way... how...  how I do the things I do.  And I need to know why you won't talk to me about my father.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: Because he never cared about us... never cared about you.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I need to know where he is, Ma.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: It doesn't matter where.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: It does matter.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: Miles, please.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I have a right to know!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: He's dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: Your father... kicked us out when you were just a baby.  He didn't want anything to do with us.  So the less you knew about him, the better.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Why didn't you just tell me?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: Because it was over.  Your dad has been dead a long time.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Where's his body?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: Somewhere you can never go.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HORACE: Pierre, if it was caused by the electromagnetism, we need to know.  You wanna see it now?  Y--yeah, he just got back.  I'll send him out with it right away.  Okay!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HORACE: Did you bring the package?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: "Package"?  You mean the corpse?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HORACE: Yeah.  Now I need you to bring it out to Dr. Chang at the Orchid.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Listen, man.  I'm security.  If you just need somebody to drive the van, can't someone from the motor pool do it?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HORACE:  If I wanted someone from the motor pool, I would have asked them.  And since LaFleur decided to disappear, you're all I've got.  So just bring it out to Dr. Chang, and we'll all call it a day.  Okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Hey!  What the hell are you doing?!  That's my van!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Nah, dude, I just signed it out.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Doesn't matter.  It's mine.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Well, where you going?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: The Orchid.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Me too.  I made lunch for the crew.  Sandwiches.  Want one?  Ham and cheese, and I made my secret garlic mayo.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: You're waiting for the next van.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Why?  We're going to the same place.  Why don't we carpool?  It'll help with global warming, which hasn't happened yet, so maybe we can prevent it.  ...Wait a sec.  Are you on some kind of secret mission?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Just get in.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE: Hi.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: How'd it go?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE: We gave him to them--to the Others.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: Anyone see you?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE: I don't think so.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: Did James help?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE: Yes.  Thank you so much for sending him.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: Of course.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: Hey.   I got here as soon as I could.  All the vans were out, so I had to ru--
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: Where's Ben?  Did he...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: No!  No, Roger.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: Then where is he?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: Roger, I--I'm so sorry.  I--I was gone for ten minutes.  I--I--I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: What?  You--you said he was dying.  How could he be gone?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: I don't know!  I'm--Roger--
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER:  What is she telling me, that he just got up and walked out?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE: I don't know.  I just got here--
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: You're his doctors!  You're supposed to watch him!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: I know.  I know.  Roger, if we just calm down--
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: Don't tell me to calm down!  Somebody came and took my boy out of here?!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: I know.  I am so sorry.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: I'm going to Security.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET:  Well... here we go.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 STEREO: Got on board a westbound 747...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: How do you spell "bounty hunter"?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: What are you doing, writing your memoirs?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: It's personal.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude... did you just... you know?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: You know.  It stinks.  Did you...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Well, it wasn't me.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: So roll down your window.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Nah, man, there's something foul in here.  It's coming from back there.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Maybe it's your famous garlic mayo.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Unh-unh.  That's not possible.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Okay, maybe it is possible.  Pull over.  I gotta check.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Forget it.  You're imagining things.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: I gotta check.  If those sandwiches are bad, people could get sick.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Will you pull over?!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude, there's a body bag back here.  With a body in it.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: That's traditionally what you put in a body bag.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Yeah, well, who is he?  What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Don't worry about it and don't tell anybody you saw him.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude, what happened to him?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: His name's Alvarez.  He was digging a hole and thinking about some chick named Andréa.  Then he felt this sharp pain in his mouth, which turned out to be a filling from his tooth being yanked right out of its socket and... blowing through his brain.  Then he was dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: How does a filling get blown through someone's head?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Got me.  Can we go now?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: How do you know all this?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Because...  I know.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Yeah, but how do you know what he was thinking?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I just know.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: You can talk to dead people.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Can we please just go?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY:  Don't worry, dude.  Your secret's safe with me.  You wanna know why?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: 'Cause I can talk to 'em, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: If you don't mind, Mr. Gray, can you tell me what happened to him?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MR. GRAY: Last Labor Day weekend, drunk driver ran the light.  That was that.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Where is your son buried?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MR. GRAY: We cremated him, scattered the ashes on the football field at school.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: For what I do, it's much better if there's a body.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MR. GRAY: Oh, but your ad said you could communicate with the dead anytime, anywhere.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I--I know what my ad says, Mr. Gray, but it--
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MR. GRAY: Please.  I just want you to ask him...  did he know that I loved him?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: It's gonna cost extra.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MR. GRAY: Of course.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MR. GRAY: Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Uh... okay, now... please give me your hands.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I want you to concentrate on Russell.  Just get a picture of him in your head.  Can you do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MR. GRAY: Yeah.  Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MR. GRAY: Did it work?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Your son says he knew that you loved him.  He always knew.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MR. GRAY: Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I'm sorry for your loss.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 NAOMI: Excuse me.  Miles Straume?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 NAOMI: Hi.  My name's Naomi Dorrit.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 NAOMI: My employer's been following your work for some time now, and he's interested in retaining your rather unique services.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 NAOMI: There's a restaurant not too far from here.  Would you like to hear what I have to say?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Yeah.  Absolutely.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE: Hi, Roger.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE: You okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER:  Let me see...  Well, my son got shot and now he's disappeared, so...  I think I'm pretty far from okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE:  You know, I'm sure... things are gonna work out.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: Well, thanks for the pep talk.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE: I just have a feeling he's gonna be okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: What do you mean, a feeling?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE: I just don't think that you should give up hope.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: Do you know something?  Do you know what happened to my son?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE: No, I don't.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: Wait a minute.  Why are you so interested in my kid?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 KATE: You know, I'm sorry I came over here, all right?  I was just trying to help.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: Oh, you're trying to help, huh?  You wanna help, Kate?!  Well, why don't you just mind your own business?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 STEREO: Love / Love will keep us together...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: I don't know why you just won't admit it.  You can trust me.  I talk to lots of dead people.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES:  So, you have conversations with them, like they're your pals?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Sure, all the time.  Sometimes we even play chess.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: You actually see them?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Of course.  Why wouldn't I?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Because that's not how it works.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Aha!  You wouldn't know how it works unless you can do it.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: What I can do has nothing to do with chatting with ghosts, you nitwit.  It's a... feeling... a sense.  When somebody's dead, their brain stops functioning, which means there's no more talking.  There's just who they were and whatever they knew before they died.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY:  That's how it works for me.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Great.  I'm happy for you.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: You're just jealous my powers are better than yours.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: We're here.  Now shut the hell up and deliver your damn sandwiches.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG:  What's he doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Um, he came to deliver lunch to the work crew.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: Lunch?  Your instructions were to come alone.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Don't worry.  I won't tell anyone about the body.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG:  He knows?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I'm sorry, sir.  He--he was rooting around in the back, and he saw it.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude.  I can keep a secret.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: Well, you'd better...  "Hurley", 'cause if you think working in the kitchen is bad--
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: I like the kitchen.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: Well, how do you feel about polar bear feces?  Because if you breathe one word of this, I'll have you shipped to Hydra Island so you can weigh turds for their ridiculous experiments.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Gross.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: You two!  Get the package inside.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG:  And you?  Stay here till I get back.  You think you can handle that?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES:  Yes, sir.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 FIRST DHARMA INITIATIVE MAN: What the hell's he got, Jimmy Hoffa in here?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SECOND DHARMA INITIATIVE MAN: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 FIRST DHARMA INITIATIVE MAN: Lift him. 
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude, that guy's a total douche.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG:  Don't...  You are not qualified to be touching that!...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: That douche is my dad.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG:  What the hell do you think you're doing?  What are you doing?!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: You did say you were taking me out to dinner.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 NAOMI: No, I said I was taking you to a restaurant.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: You wanna tell me what's back here, sweetheart?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 NAOMI: Your audition.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Look, whatever you got going on here, this isn't really my thing.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 NAOMI: From what I understand, Miles, if the price is right, this is exactly your thing.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 NAOMI: So what can you tell me about this man?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: His name's Felix.  He was... on his way to deliver something to, uh...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: A guy named... Wid-more.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 NAOMI: Deliver what?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: A bunch of papers, photos, pictures... of...  empty graves.  A purchase order... for an old airplane.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES:  So... did I pass?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 NAOMI: I'm leading an expedition to an island, and on the island is a man that will be very difficult to find.  That's why I need you.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Need me for what?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 NAOMI: This island has a number of deceased individuals... residing on it, and as this man is the one responsible for their being deceased, we believe they can supply invaluable information as to his whereabouts.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: As much as hunting down a mass murderer sounds really safe, uh, I'm--I'm gonna pass.  Thanks for the audition.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 NAOMI: My employer is willing to pay you $1.6 million.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: When do we leave?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY:  So anyway...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I don't want to talk about it.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Are you kidding me?  How weird is it that your dad is that dude from all those movies?  Only back then, he was called Marvin Candle.  Was that, like, a stage name?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: What part of "I don't want to talk about it" isn't sinking in?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Well, if you didn't want to talk about it, why'd you tell me?  How long have you known he was your dad?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Third day we were here, I was on line at the cafeteria, and my mother got in line behind me.  That was my first clue.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: But all those DHARMA dudes end up dead.  Don't you wanna... save him?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I can't save him!  They're gonna get killed no matter what I do, so why bother?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: I need you to take me to Radzinsky at the work site.  Immediately.  You... Hurley--you say a word...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Polar bear poop.  Got it.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: What happened to the body?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: What body?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: This room is on my rounds.  What are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JACK: I figured I'd cover for ya.  I heard what happened to your son.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: Which part--that he got shot or that someone kidnapped him from the Infirmary?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JACK: Then what are you doing here at work?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: What else am I gonna do?  Sit around and pray that those idiots are gonna find my boy?  So you can get outta here.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: You came in here a couple days ago with that woman Kate, right?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: You know her at all?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JACK: Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER:  'Cause she's got some... kinda weird thing for my kid.  First, she shows up at the infirmary and gave him blood.  But then when he goes missing, she comes to me and she says, "Don't worry.  He's gonna be okay."  I'm gonna tell you somethin', man.  I'm beginning to think that she's got something to do with this.  I should go to Horace, report her.  What do you think?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JACK: I think, Roger, that, uh, that you've had a hell of a day, and that... it's given you a very good excuse to go out and get drunk.  Maybe that's put some--some crazy ideas into your head.  I know that woman--Kate.  She's my friend, and she would never do anything to hurt your son.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 ROGER: Sure.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: So I'm new here, Dr. Chang.  What is it exactly you do at the Orchid?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: It's classified.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Oh, really?  You can't tell anyone?  Not even your wife?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: What about your kids?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: I have a 3-month-old son, so, no, I haven't told him.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: 3 months?  Wow!  Congrats.  What's his name?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: Miles.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Small world!  That's your name, too.  Right, Miles?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: So are you a fan of jazz, Dr. Chang?  Like Miles Davis?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: My wife is.    I like country.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: So you two have been here for... three years now.  Must be pretty tight, huh?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Dr. Chang and I... don't exactly travel in the same circles.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: I wasn't aware there were circles.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Great.  We should all... get together for a beer sometime.  How awesome would that be?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: Stop here.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG:  You don't need to wait.  I'll get a ride back with Radzinsky.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude, what is this place?  And what's up with all the secrecy?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Don't know.  Don't care.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 WORKER: Hey, Glenn!  What's the serial number that goes on the hatch lid?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 GLENN: 4, 8...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 GLENN: 15...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 GLENN: 16...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 GLENN: 23...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 GLENN: Hold on a minute.  It's smudged.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: 42.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 GLENN: 42.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: How the hell did you know that?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: 'Cause they're building our hatch.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: What hatch?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: The one that crashed our plane.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MAN IN VAN: Hey, Miles.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Do I know you?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MAN IN VAN:  Miles!  My name's Bram.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: You owe me a fish taco.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 BRAM: Sorry about that, but your apartment's being watched.  And we had to try our best to talk you out of working for Charles Widmore.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I have no idea who that is.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 BRAM: He's the man who chartered the boat you'll be getting on next week.  And, my friend, you do not want to get on that boat.  Do you know what lies in the shadow of the statue?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: No, can't say that I do.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 BRAM: Then you're not ready to go to that island.  But if you come with us--all those things you've spent your life trying to find out?  You'll know.  You'll know who you are, Miles--why it is you have a gift, and most of all, you'll know about your father.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I don't know where you've been getting your intel, but I stopped caring about my father a long time ago.  What I do care about is money.  So, I'll tell you what.  You want me to pass on going to the Island?  It's gonna cost you double what they offered--$3.2 million.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 BRAM: We're not paying you anything.  All the money in the world isn't gonna fill that empty hole inside you, Miles.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: That's sad, isn't it?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 BRAM: Toss him!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 BRAM: You're playing for the wrong team!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Yeah?  What team are you on?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 BRAM: The one that's gonna win.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: That hatch they're building?  There's gonna be an accident, then they're gonna have to build a computer with a button you have to push so the world doesn't end.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: So your dad... is he around... you know, when we came from?  The future?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Well, then this is kind of awesome for you, huh?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: How is it awesome?!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Because you get to hang out with him, you know, get to know him better and stuff.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Ch.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: And don't bother thanking me, but he was totally down for that beer, dude.  You know, and maybe he'll let you hold baby you, or you can change your own diaper or--
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Whoa!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Listen up, 'cause we're only gonna have this conversation once.  Okay?  I don't want to "hang out" with my dad.  I don't want to "know him better"... "and stuff".
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Why not?  Did he beat you up when you were little or something?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: He wasn't even around when I was little, you dimwit!  I never knew him, until now.  Why am I even telling you this?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: 'Cause you're in pain and you need to let it out.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I'm not in pain!  It doesn't matter.  My father is dead!  He's gone!  He never cared about me, and nothing I can do will ever change that.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: But he's not gone.  We just dropped him off.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: You want to get into my business?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Let's get into yours!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Give that back to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: How about we read your little diary?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: It's not a diary!  It's personal!!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Let's see what's going on--
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Give that--give that back to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: --in that piece of granite you call a head.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Give it back!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: "Exterior--Hoth.  A little spy robot thingy zips through the atmosphere and crashes into the snowy planet below.  That's when Chewbacca shows up and blasts it away with his crossbow laser.  He shakes his fury fist in the sky in triumph.  Chewbacca--Raaar."
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY:  It's "furry."  "Furry fist."  I need a spell-check.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: What the hell is this?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: I'm writing Empire Strikes Back.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Uh... I'm sorry.  What?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: It's 1977, right?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: So Stars Wars just came out.  And pretty soon, George Lucas is gonna be looking for a sequel.  I've seen Empire, like, 200 times, so I figured I'd make life easier and send him the script... with a couple improvements.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: That has gotta be the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Oh, yeah?  Well, at least I'm not scared to talk to my own dad.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: James. You're back.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Barely.  You ever had one of those days you feel like the little Dutch boy with your finger in the...
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Doc.  Hey.  What's going on?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JACK: Ben's father thinks that Kate had something to do with his son going missing.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Why the hell would he think that?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: Because she talked to him, tried to make him feel better.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JACK: Her heart was in the right place.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Yeah, well, where was her head?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JACK: I had a talk with Roger.  I don't think he's gonna say anything to anyone for now.  Just wanted you to know.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JACK:  Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JULIET: Mm.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Yeah?  Well...  thanks for filling me in, Doc.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 JACK: No problem.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 PHIL: Hey, boss.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 PHIL: We got a development.  You better come to the office.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Phil, I've been running around the jungle all day, so whatever developments you got can wait a while.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 PHIL: I know who took the kid.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Yeah?  Who's that?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 PHIL: You.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: Got a perfectly good explanation for what you saw on that tape.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 PHIL: I sure as hell hope so.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER: You talk to Horace yet?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 PHIL: No.  I thought that after three years of working together, I'd give you the benefit of the doubt--
Lost.Season05.Episode13 SAWYER:  Get some rope.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Mr. Gray?  I hope you don't mind.  Your gate was open.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MR. GRAY: Mr. Straume.  Of course.  Of course.  No problem.  What, uh, what brings you by?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Well, sir, uh...  I'm about to go on a boat trip for a while, and... I wanted to give this back to you.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: I lied to you, Mr. Gray.  I wasn't able to talk to your son.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MR. GRAY: Why are you telling me this?  You could have just let me go on believing what you said.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: That wouldn't have been fair to your son.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MR. GRAY: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: If you needed your son to know that you loved him, you should've told him when he was still alive.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: Sorry I said you were afraid to talk to your dad, dude.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Don't worry about it.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: I used to hate my dad, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Yeah?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: He left when I was 10.  But the best thing I ever did was give him a second chance.  We got to be the best of friends, and although I may never see him again, I miss him.  And I know he feels the same.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: My dad didn't leave when I was 10.  I--I was a baby.  I never knew him.  And I don't want to.  It's not happening.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: That was Luke's attitude, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 HURLEY: In Empire, Luke found out Vader was his father, but instead of putting away his lightsaber and talking about it, he overreacted and got his hand cut off.  I mean, they worked it out eventually, but at what cost?  Another Death Star was destroyed, Boba Fett got eaten by the Sarlacc, and we got the Ewoks.  It all could've been avoided if they'd just, you know, communicated.  And let's face it.  The Ewoks sucked, dude.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG:  Wow!  Oh, wow!
Lost.Season05.Episode13 LARA: Hello?  Oh, one moment.  It's for you.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: Hello?  All right.  I'll be right there.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: Miles!  I need you.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: You do?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: Sub's here from H.Q.  I need your help bringing them in.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Sure.  New recruits?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 DR. CHANG: No, uh, scientists from Ann Arbor.  Get your van, and let's get to the dock.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MAN:  Hey, can I get a hand with this?
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES:  Yeah, yeah, sure.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 MILES: Dan.
Lost.Season05.Episode13 FARADAY: Hey, Miles.  Long time no see.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MAN: He's coding!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MAN: Gunshot wound. He's crashing!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DOCTOR: Bay 7. Now!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: Is he gonna be okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DOCTOR: You're gonna have to wait here, ma'am.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: Where are you--where are you taking him?  What's happening?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DOCTOR: Please, ma'am, wait here.  We'll let you know as soon as we know anything.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: Well, what's happening?  Is he gonna be okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DOCTOR: We're going to do everything we can.  Please just wait.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 CHARLIE HUME: Daddy!  
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: He's gonna be okay.  He's gonna be okay.  
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: How old is your son?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: He's 2.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING:  He has his father's hair.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: I'm sorry.  Do I know you?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Uh, no, but your husband does. I'm Eloise Hawking, and I believe it's my son's fault that Desmond has been shot.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: Your son is Benjamin Linus?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING:  Good lord, no. My son is Daniel Faraday.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Hey, can I get a hand with this?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MILES: Yeah, yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MILES: Dan.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Hey, Miles.  Long time no see.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG: All right, ladies and gentlemen, you know why you're here.  I wish you could all get a good night's sleep, but, uh...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MILES:  What the hell are you doing back here, Dan?  Once you left for Ann Arbor, I figured you'd gotten rich, invented the DVD or something.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 CHANG: The shuttle will pick you up at the motor pool...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY:  This is what I'm doing back here.  When did they get here?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MILES: A few days ago.  It's weird, huh?  LaFleur managed to--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: We don't have time.  I need you to take me to Jack's right now, okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Jack.  How did you get back here?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Faraday?  What the--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: How did you do it?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Whoa.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: How did you get back to the Island?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Where have you been?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I was--I was just at DHARMA headquarters in Ann Arbor.  I was doing some research.  What's more important right now... how did you get back here to 1977?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK:  What's going on?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MILES: Don't look at me.  I just carried his luggage.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Jack, how?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Uh... we were on a plane, and then--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Who told you to get on a plane?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: As a matter of fact, Dan, it was your mother.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY:  And how did she convince you, Jack?  Did she tell you it was your destiny?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Yeah.  That's exactly what she said.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Well, I got some bad news for you, Jack.  You don't belong here at all.  She was wrong.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 BOY: What's wrong, mom?  Didn't you like it?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WOMAN:  I loved it.  It was beautiful, Daniel.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 ELOISE: Daniel... do you know what destiny means?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DANIEL: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 ELOISE: Destiny means that, if one has a special gift, then it must be nurtured.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 ELOISE: How many beats has that metronome counted since you started playing?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DANIEL: 864.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 ELOISE: Your gift, Daniel, is your mind--a mind that is meant for science, mathematics.  And it's my... job to keep you on your path.  So... unfortunately, there's no more time...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 ELOISE: ...for distractions.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DANIEL: But I want to keep playing the piano.  I can do both.  I can make time.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 ELOISE: If only you could.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Miles, I need you to bring me to the Orchid.  Can you drive me right now?  Please?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MILES: Yeah, yeah, sure.  I guess.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Thanks.  Come on.  Let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Faraday!  Wait up!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Miles, come on.  Jack, we'll be right back.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Hey, what did you mean, you mother was wrong?  Daniel!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I just--I just have an errand to run.  Be right back!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: Yeah?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Faraday's back.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: What do you mean Faraday's back?  Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: I have no idea.  He came in on the sub, and he woke me up.  He--he started talking nonsense, and then he took off for the Orchid.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: I'd love to trade theories about this, but I'm a little busy right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: What are you busy with at 6:00 in the morning?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JULIET: James, tell him.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER:  Get in here.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: Phil--one of my security guys--got himself a videotape of me and Kate taking the kid out to the Hostiles.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: And where's the tape?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: With Phil.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: And where is Phil?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: Phil, Jack.  Jack... Phil.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MILES: Are we... waiting for something?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Right on time.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I'll be back in ten minutes.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 TONY: So what do you want me to do?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG: You're gonna do nothing.  If you drill even 1 centimeter further, you risk releasing that energy.  If that were to happen... then God help us all.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SEALS: Hey!  You need a hard hat down here.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG: Watch yourself!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Sorry, sir.  Won't happen again.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MAN: Come on.  I'll grab the rest of his stuff.  Let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 TONY:  Did you hear that?  Time travel.  How stupid does that guy think we are?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Dr. Chang?  Dr. Chang?  Do you have a second, sir?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG:  I suppose.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I just came in on the sub with the Swan team.  We actually met three years ago, I'm Daniel Faraday.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG: Yes.  Yes.  Uh, you arrived with LaFleur.  I remember.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Right.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG: What can I do for you?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I need you to order the evacuation of every man, woman and child on this Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG: And why would I do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: A man is on a stretcher as a consequence of the electromagnetic activity that your drilling unleashed down here.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG: Which is now contained.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: It's contained down here.  But in about six hours, the same thing is gonna happen at the site for the Swan station, only the energy there is about 30,000 times more powerful, sir.  And the accident... it's gonna be catastrophic.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG: That is utterly absurd.  What could possibly qualify you to make that kind of prediction?  Hmm?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I'm from the future.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Dr. Chang, wait!  Will you wait one second, please?  Wait one--one second.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG: Yes, yes, you're from the future.  You heard me talking about time travel.  Now you've had your fun.  Good for you.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: No, no.  Please, Dr. Chang.  Just look at my journal, please.  Look at these equations.  Some of them won't be discovered for another 20 years.  Dr. Chang--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MILES: Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey, Dan!  Leave the man alone.  Sorry, Dr. Chang.  I think he had too many drugs on the sub--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Dr. Chang...  Miles is your son.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Think about it.  A Chinese man named Miles--the same name as your baby--shows up with me from the future.  You--you really think this is all coincidence?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG: Is this true?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MILES: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DR. CHANG: Please... stay away from me.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Dr. Chang...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Dr. Chang!  If you--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MILES: Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Are you out of your mind?  What are you doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I'm just making sure that your father does what he's supposed to do.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MILES: And what's that?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: You'll see.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Hi, Mom.  I want you to meet Theresa.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 THERESA:  Dan's told me so much about--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Pleased to meet you.  Well done, Daniel.  Ah...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 THERESA:  You must be so proud of him.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Daniel, I thought we could celebrate your accomplishment with lunch.  There's a nice restaurant nearby.  I reserved us a table.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: We would love to. 
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING:  Actually, I was hoping it would be just the two of us.   You do understand, don't you?  It's just that I don't get to see my son very often.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Mother...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 THERESA: I understand.  It's okay, Dan.  Really.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Is there something bothering you, Daniel?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: You were so rude to Theresa.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING:  was I?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Theresa is my girlfriend.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: She is your research assistant.  You should be focusing your energies on your work.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: On my work.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Yes.  That is what is important.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Yes.  You've made it abundantly clear.  Why would I waste my gift on a woman--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: I'm sorry to tell you, Daniel, but you're not going to have time for relationships.  The women in your life will only be terribly hurt.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: What does that mean?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: It means that your work will always comes first, that's all.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Only because that's what you always push me to do.  You pushed and you pushed and you pushed.  And when will it be enough, Mother?  When?  I'm the youngest doctor to ever graduate from Oxford.  I just got a new 1.5 million pound research grant.  What else do I have to do?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: A grant?  That's wonderful!  From whom?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I don't know.  Um... some industrialist.  Widmore, I think.  Charles Widmore.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING:  I don't want to fight with you, Daniel.  That's not why I came.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Why did you come?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: To congratulate you.  Good luck, Daniel.  And I do hope you know that I mean that.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER:  All right, people.  Party's over.  I know y'all just showed up.  The rest of us have been here for the past three years.  This is our home.  The last thing I wanna do is leave.  But we ain't got no choice.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 HURLEY: Well, that dude in the closet--I thought he worked for you.  Can't you convince him that it was all, like, a misunderstanding?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: I punched the man in the damn face, Hugo.  What am I supposed to say--"My fist slipped"?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: How much time do we have before someone realizes he's gone?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: Not enough.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JULIET: So where do we go?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER:  We only got two options.  We can either commandeer the sub, get the hell off this Island before anyone knows we're gone, or we can head back in the jungle, start from square one.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JIN: I'm not getting on that sub if there's a chance that my wife is still on this Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 HURLEY: Yeah, me neither.  After all we did to get back here?  And now we're just gonna run off again?  It'd be kinda wishy-washy.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: Right. That's two votes for square one.  Anybody else wanna--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: Hold your horses.  Be right there.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY:  Hey, James.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: Welcome to the meeting, Twitchy.  Good to see you again.  Pound cake's in the kitchen.  Help yourself to the punch.    Is he still crazy?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MILES: It's on a whole new level, man.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER:  Great.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Jack, I'm sorry I was rude before, but what I came to do is of critical importance to everyone in this room.  Does anyone know where I can find the Hostiles?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JULIET: Why do you need to know that, Daniel?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY:  Because one of them is my mother.  And she is the only person on this island who can get us back to where we belong.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 NEWSCASTER:  This haunting footage comes to us from the Christiane I, a salvage vehicle in the Indian Ocean.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 CAROLINE: How do you want your eggs, Dan?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 NEWSCASTER:  For more than two months, it's been scouring the depths of the Sunda Trench off Bali...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 CAROLINE: So what happened?  They found that missing plane?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 NEWSCASTER:  ...in search of the long-missing Oceanic Flight 815.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 CAROLINE: Dan?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 NEWSCASTER:  Late last night, the Christiane deployed two remotely operated vehicles, or ROVs...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 CAROLINE: Dan...?  Dan, why are you so upset?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 NEWSCASTER:  ...that verified what the national transportation safety board had long feared...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I don't know.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 NEWSCASTER:  ...that the commercial aircraft...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 NEWSCASTER:  ...on September 22nd, 2004...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 CAROLINE: You have a visitor, Dan.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 CAROLINE: Would you like some tea?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: That would be lovely.  Hello, Daniel.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I'm sorry, sir.  I don't... D--did Caroline tell you I have a condition that affects my memory?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: Just... don't be embarrassed.  We've never met.  My name is Charles Widmore.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Charles... Charles Widmore from... my research grant?    It's very nice to meet you, sir.  Please, sit down.  Um...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Mm, a bit of a mess.  I meant to thank you before I... before I left Oxford.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: You mean, before you were dismissed.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY:  I tested it...  I tested it out on myself first.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: It's all right, Daniel.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I would never hurt Theresa.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: Please, it's all right.  That's not why I'm here.  I came to offer you a new opportunity.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: N--no, I... I'm sorry. I--I can't.  I don't think I--I can...  
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: Did I say something to upset you?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: It's this plane crash.  I don't know why it's bothering me so much.   it's just so sad.  They're dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: Daniel, what if I told you... they're not dead?  What if I told you the plane was a fake?  An elaborate...  expensive fake.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY:  How would you know that?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: Because I put it there.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Well... why would you tell me that?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: Because come tomorrow, you won't remember I did.  Daniel, the real Oceanic Flight 815 crashed on an island--a special island with unique scientific properties.  I want to send you to the Island.  It will further your research, show you things you'd never dream of.  But more importantly, it will heal you, Daniel--your mind, your memory.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: H--heal me?  W--why are you doing all this for me?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: Because you're a man of tremendous gifts, and it would be a shame to see them go to waste.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY:  You sound like my mother.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE:  That's because we're old friends.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: Your mother is an Other?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: You met her, actually, when the Island was skipping, back in 1954.  They were calling her "Ellie".
Lost.Season05.Episode14 HURLEY: You guys were in 1954?  Like... Fonzie times?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JULIET: You still haven't told us why you need to find her.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I just need to talk to her.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: I thought you said we were supposed to lay low.  "Whatever happened, happened"?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Just tell me where they are, and I'll go--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: I'm not telling you anything, and you ain't going anywhere unless you wanna share with us what the hell it is you're doing.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Sawyer, he said he can get us back to where we belonged.  Whether we go on the sub or we head back into the jungle... we don't belong here.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: Well, I belonged here just fine till you came back, Doc.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK:  You know where the Hostiles are.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: You and Sawyer took Ben out to them.  Can you get us back out there?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: Whoa, hold on a second.  Don't say a word, Kate.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: She can say what she wants to say.  Kate...  You made me promise to never ask what happened to Aaron, or why you came back here.  But I know that reason isn't... it isn't here.   It's not now.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: Whatever her reason is, helping H.G. Wells here talk to his mommy ain't got nothing to do with it.  Come with us, Freckles.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JULIET: The code for the fence is 1-4-1-7-1-7.  You should take Daniel.  It's over here for us anyway.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: Okay.  Let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DANIEL: Great.  Great. Thank you.  Hey, Miles, can you drive us?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: When you realize you've made a huge mistake... we'll be back at the beach, right where we started.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: All right, the rest of us--pack anything you can carry, meet back here in 20 minutes.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER:  Time to go.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: These people are not gonna be happy to see us.  It might be a good idea to bring some guns.  There's a gun safe in the motor pool, but it's locked.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Good thing I'm a janitor then.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: Hey, Dan?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I'll meet you at the motor pool.  I need just a minute. Okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 CHARLOTTE:  I'm not allowed to have chocolate before dinner.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY:  It's okay, sweetheart.  I won't tell.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 CHARLOTTE: My name's Charlotte.  What's yours?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I'm Daniel.  I'm new here.  Listen.  Do you know Dr. Chang?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 CHARLOTTE: Uh-huh.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Yeah?  Hopefully really soon, Dr. Chang is gonna ask a bunch of people to get on the submarine and leave the Island.   When he does, you and your mommy... you're gonna have to leave.  In case what I do doesn't work, you cannot be here.  You have to leave.    I tried to avoid telling you this.  I didn't think I could change things.  But maybe I can.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Hey, how long will it take us to get up there?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: Uh, it depends.  We can take the road until we hit the pylons, but then once we're in their territory, we gotta go on foot.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Okay.  Uh, do you have something for a beginner?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: That's ready to go.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RADZINSKY: What's going on here?  Aren't you one of the physicists off the sub?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Yeah, that's right.  Uh, we were just making sure that--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RADZINSKY: You're supposed to be out at the Swan site.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Right.  Uh, there was--there was an accident at the Orchid station.  Dr. Chang asked us to help.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RADZINSKY: He's got a gun.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RADZINSKY: I just left Dr. Chang.  He's at home with his wife and baby.  You're lying. Now drop the guns and get down on the ground!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY:  Hey.  Listen to me.  Listen.  You really do not understand what's happening here.  You have no idea.  We have no time.  We have to leave.  All right?  So we're just gonna leave.  Okay?  Nobody's--no...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RADZINSKY: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE:  Are you okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE:  I think we can make it to the Jeep.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: All right.  I'll cover you.  Dan?  You go, too, all right?  Go, go, go!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RADZINSKY: Sound the alarm!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Hello, Daniel.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Mother.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: When did you get here?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Oh, I just arrived.  I would have called you, but...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I would have forgotten anyway.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: I hear you have been offered a job.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: How do you know that?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Well, it's my business to know.  I came here, Daniel, to tell you that it is very important that you say yes to Mr. Widmore... that you accept this opportunity.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I can't.  He needs someone who can do really, really complex space-time calibrations and calculate bearings, and I just... I don't know how to do that anymore.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Daniel...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Mm.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: This place he mentioned to you, this island--did he tell you that it could make you better?  What if it's true?  Why, then you could go on with your work.  Just think of all you could accomplish.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: You really want me to... to go?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Will...  will it make you proud of me?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING:  Yes, Daniel.  It will.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY:  Then I'll do it.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: You remember the code?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: Yeah, I got it.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: All right, I'm gonna take a look at that.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Yeah, good.  It's just a graze.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Whew.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: This is gonna sting.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Ah.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Yeah, you're gonna be fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I guess I'm lucky.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: What's luck have to do with it?  I thought you said "Whatever happened, happened"?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: You gotta understand, Jack, this is our present.  When we met, did I have a scar on my neck?  No.  'Cause I hadn't been shot yet.  We can't be so naive as to think nothing can happen to us.  Any one of us can die, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: Okay.  It's off.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Which way?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: Just a couple miles in.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE:  Do you think he knows what he's doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: I sure hope so.  There's no turning back now.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: You called it the minute those Yahoos got here.  I shoulda listened to you.  You can say, "I told you so."
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JULIET: Maybe after we get to the beach.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER:  Hey.    You still got my back?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JULIET: You still got mine?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 HURLEY: That's not good, right?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JIN: 
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RADZINSKY: LaFleur!  Where have you been?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Take it easy, Stu.  What the hell's going on?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RADZINSKY: I just got shot by a physicist, and the new recruits are helping him.  We've been infiltrated.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: That's ridiculous.  Now just calm down for a minute.  We can talk about this.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RADZINSKY: What was that?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 SAWYER: It sounded like it was from outside.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RADZINSKY: Get down on the ground now.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RADZINSKY: I said now!
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE:  Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: You need a gun to go talk to your mother, Dan?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: You don't know my mother, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: You ready to tell me why she was wrong?  Why we don't belong here?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: In about four hours, the DHARMA folks at the swan work site--they're gonna--gonna drill into the ground and accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy.  The result of the release of this energy would be catastrophic.  So in order to contain it, they're gonna have to cement the entire area in, like Chernobyl.  And this containment--the place they built over it--I believe you called it "the Hatch."  The Swan hatch?  Because of this one accident, these people are gonna spend the next 20 years keeping that energy at bay... by pressing a button... a button that your friend Desmond will one day fail to push, and that will cause your plane--Oceanic 815--to crash on this Island.  And because your plane crashed, a freighter will be sent to this Island--a freighter I was on and Charlotte was on and so forth.  This entire chain of events--it's gonna start happening this afternoon.  But... we can change that.  I studied relativistic physics my entire life.  One thing emerged over and over--can't change the past.  Can't do it.  Whatever happened, happened.  All right?  But then I finally realized... I had been spending so much time focused on the constants, I forgot about the variables.  Do you know what the variables in these equations are, Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK:  No.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Us.  We're the variables.  People.  We think.  We reason.  We make choices.  We have free will.  We can change our destiny.  I think I can negate that energy under the Swan.  I think I can destroy it.  If I can, then that hatch will never be built, and your plane... your plane will land, just like it's supposed to, in Los Angeles.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: And just how exactly do you plan on destroying this energy?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WOMAN:  Satellite pharmacy...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: Daniel Faraday?  Your son is Daniel Faraday?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING:  Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: That's the man who sent Desmond to Los Angeles to find you.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: That's right.  I came, Penelope, to apologize.  Your husband has become a casualty in a conflict that's bigger than him, that's bigger than any of us.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: What do you mean?  Is Des gonna be okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: I don't know.  For the first time in a long time, I don't know what's going to happen next.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 NURSE: Ms. Hume?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: Yes?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 NURSE: Your husband's in the recovery room, and he's asking for you.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: The recovery room?  Is he--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 NURSE: He's doing fine.  Come with me.  This nurse will watch your son.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: Hi.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DESMOND: Hi.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 PENNY: I thought I'd lost you.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 DESMOND: I promised you, Penny.  I promised you...  I'd never leave you again.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: Is he all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Yes, Charles.  He's fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: Good.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Your daughter's in there.  Why don't you go in and say hello?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: Unfortunately, Eloise, my relationship with Penelope is one of the things I had to sacrifice.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 MS. HAWKING: Sacrifice?  Don't you talk to me about sacrifice, Charles.  I had to send my son back to the Island, knowing full well that--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 WIDMORE: He was my son, too, Eloise.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: This is a mistake.  He's talking about erasing everything that's ever happened to us, Jack.  It's insane.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: We disappeared off a plane in mid-air and ended up in 1977.  I'm getting kinda used to insane.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 OTHER MAN: Well, that should be enough.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 OTHER WOMAN: I think we need more water.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Wish me luck.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 JACK: Wait.  Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 KATE: No, let him go.  Let him go.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Back up.  Step away.  It's okay.  Nobody move.  I only want to speak to Eloise.  Where is Eloise?  Come on.  Where is she?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RICHARD: I'm sorry, but Elo--
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RICHARD: She's not here right now.  Do we know each other?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: It doesn't matter.  I need you to take me to Eloise.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RICHARD: I--I already told you she's not here.  Let's just take it easy.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Where's the bomb, Richard?  The hydrogen bomb that I told you people to bury--where is it?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RICHARD: Listen to me. Lower your gun, and we'll talk.  Okay?  Nobody has to get hurt here.  Just put the gun down.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I'm gonna give you three seconds.  One...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RICHARD: Don't do this.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Two...
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RICHARD: Why did you do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 ELOISE: He had a gun on you.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 RICHARD: He wasn't gonna shoot me, Eloise.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: Eloise.    You knew.  You always knew.   You knew this was gonna happen.  You sent me here anyway.
Lost.Season05.Episode14 ELOISE: Who are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode14 FARADAY: I... I'm your son. 
Lost.Season05.Episode15 FARADAY: Where's the bomb, Richard?  Where is it?  The hydrogen bomb that I told your people to bury.  Where is it?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Listen to me.  Lower your gun, and we'll talk.  Okay?  Nobody has to get hurt here.  Just put the gun down.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 FARADAY: I'm gonna give you three seconds.  One...
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Don't do this.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: What's he doing down there?  Jack, he's crazy.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: Is he?  What if this is why we're here?  What if this is our one chance to put things back the way they're supposed to be?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: What the hell do you think you're doing?!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: They shot him!  I'm gonna go help.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: Yeah, they're gonna shoot you, too.  We have to go, Jack.  We have to go now.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: Jack!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 2ND MAN:  Don't you move!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 2ND MAN: Don't move.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE:  Hey!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 WIDMORE:  Just who the bloody hell might you be?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 WIDMORE: Eloise! What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: This man walked into camp and put a gun to my head, and Eloise... reacted.  Where'd you find them?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 WIDMORE: Crouched in the bushes... like rats.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: Did you two come here with this man?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: Put them in my tent.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 WIDMORE: Would you care to tell me, Eloise, why the DHARMA Initiative seems to have declared war on us?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: These people aren't from the DHARMA Initiative, Charles.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 WIDMORE: Then where the hell are they from?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 VANESSA: Richard, he's here.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: I brought dinner.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: John?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Hello, Richard.  It's been a while.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: It's--it's been, uh, three years.  What happened?  What--where--where were you?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: I'll explain on the way.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: On the way where?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: It's gonna be night soon.  You and I have an errand to run, and we don't have a lot of time.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: What's wrong?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Something different about you.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: I have a purpose now.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: What's he doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: He helped me get back.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SUN: Why did Locke say these were his people?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: When I left the Island, John stepped in.  He's the leader now.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SUN: Who's that man he's talking to?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: His name is Richard Alpert.  He's a kind of... adviser.  And he has had that job for a very, very long time.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: Sun?  What are you...
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SUN: Were you here in 1977?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SUN: These people... Jack Shephard, Kate Austen, Hugo Reyes.  They were here with my husband--Jin Kwon.  Were you here?  Do you remember them?  A--any of them?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Yes, I was here 30 years ago.  And I do.  I remember these people.  I remember meeting them very clearly, because... I watched them all die.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Drink of water?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SUN: Do you think it's true?  They're all dead?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: I don't think we went through all this for nothing, Sun.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: I'm ready, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: You still have that compass I gave you?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: A little rusty, but she can still find north.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE:  Ben, I'd appreciate it if you'd join us.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN:  What, John, don't you trust me here with my former people?  Afraid I'll stage a coup?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: I'm not afraid of anything you can do anymore, Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: Well, in that case, I'd love to come.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Good.  Stay here.  We'll be back in a couple of hours.  I'll see what I can find out.  But whatever happens, Sun, you have my word--if there's a way for you and Jin to be together again, if there's a way to save our people... I'll find it.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: Take it easy on her!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ERIK: Don't talk.  Understand?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: Are you okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK:  Yeah.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE:  You know, before we were caught...  you said that we needed to put things back the way they were supposed to be.  What did you mean by that?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: If we can do what Faraday said...  our plane never crashes... Flight 815 lands in Los Angeles.  And everyone we lost since we got here...  they'd all be alive.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: And what about us?  We just... go on living our life because we've never met?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: All the misery that we've been through... we'd just wipe it clean.  Never happened.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: It was not all misery.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK:  Enough of it was.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: The man I shot... what did he need the bomb for?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: I need you to tell me why he needed the bomb.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: I don't think you'd believe me if I did.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: When I was 17 years old, I took a young man to the bomb.  He proceeded to tell me that if we buried it underground, then things would work out splendidly.  When I asked him how he could be so sure... he said that he was from the future.  And then he disappeared, right in front of my bloody eyes.  Ten minutes ago, I shot that man in the back.  And before he... died... he told me that he...  he said he was my son.  Explain to me... and you have my word I will believe you.  How is this my handwriting if I don't remember writing it?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: Because you haven't written it yet.  I know this is hard to understand, but... what you just did... it was an accident, and I think that there's a way for you to take it all back.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: Your son came back here because he had figured out a way to change things.  He doesn't have to be dead.  You don't have to have killed him.  If we do what's written in that journal...  none of this will have happened.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: Does he know what he's talking about?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: He thinks he does.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: All right then, I'll take you to the bomb.  Just... one small issue, however.  We secured it over 20 years ago underground.  But since that time, it appears that someone's built an entire village over it.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: The DHARMA Initiative?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: However...  it appears that you two have been passing yourselves off as members, so... I suppose coming and going will be relatively simple.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK:  Ah, it might be a little bit more complicated than that. 
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: That woman--where is she now?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: Call my lawyer.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HORACE: Stuart!  What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: I'm getting answers.  Where is she?!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HORACE: Hey.  Hey!  Stop!  Damn it, stop.  That is an order.  I'm still in charge here.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: No, you were  in charge, Horace.  But if we're gonna protect our people and all the work we're doing here, you don't have the stomach for what happens next.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: Phil.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: Okay, Jim, last chance.  You tell me where she is...
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: ...or so help me God, I will kill you.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JULIET: Hey!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: You ready to talk now?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER:  Nope.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: Believe me, I'm gettin' tired of this too, Jim.  So why don't you tell me where your girlfriend took the boy?  She bring him to the Hostiles?  You know where they are?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JULIET: Aah!  Stop!  Please!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: You want me to stop?  Then tell me what I want to know!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JULIET:  Stuart, please.  We have known each other for three years.  We are not bad people!  We are not here to hurt you!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER:  Juliet... don't.    Whatever you tell 'em, they ain't gonna believe you.   It's only gonna get more people hurt.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HORACE: What are we doing, man?  Beating him is pointless.  Okay?  He's not gonna talk.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 PHIL: I can make him talk.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: Son of a bitch!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HORACE: Easy.  Easy.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: You're a dead man, Phil.  I'm gonna kill you.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MITCH: Mr. Radzinsky?  There's still no sign of Miles or Jin.  But the recruits from last week... I got their sub's manifest from Amy.  There were three last-minute add-ons.  They were the two people that shot at you--Shephard and Austen--and one guy we can't track down.  He's gotta be a part of this.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: Who the hell is Hugo Reyes?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 PHIL: He's the fat guy.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HURLEY: So what's the rescue plan?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MILES: Rescue plan?  We're heading to the beach.  Why do you think we sent you for food?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HURLEY: But they got Sawyer and Juliet.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MILES: And there are 30 of them, and they all have guns.  The only people we can rescue is our ourselves, so let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HURLEY: We gotta do something.  I mean, Sawyer would never leave us behind.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MILES: Dr. Chang?  What are you doing here?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: I could ask you the same question.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HURLEY: But we asked you first.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: Your friend Faraday said that you were from the future.  I need to know if he was telling the truth.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HURLEY: Dude, that's ridiculous.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: What year were you born?  What year?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HURLEY: Uh... 1931?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: You're 46?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HURLEY: Yeah.  Yes, I am.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: So you fought in the Korean War?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HURLEY:  There's... no such thing.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: Who's the President of the United States?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HURLEY: All right, dude, we're from the future.  Sorry.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: It's true then?  You are my son?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MILES: Yeah, it's true.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: Your friend--the physicist--he also told me to evacuate everyone I could off the Island.  He said there was going to be a massive accident at the Swan.  Now is that true?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MILES: He's been right about everything so far.  If Faraday said get people off the Island...  I'd do it.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: Well, then let's hope he knows what he's doing.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 WIDMORE: Tell me something.  Why is it that this man looks... familiar to me?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: Richard... you and Erik are coming with me.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 WIDMORE: Going with you where?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE:  You can untie them.  And... would you mind giving us a moment?  I'm taking them to the bomb.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 WIDMORE: What?  Are you insane?  I'm worried about you.  Not in your condition.  
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: Who is he?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: The man you're asking about, Jack, is Charles Widmore.  He and Eloise are... well, let's just say love can be complicated.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: All right.  Let's move out.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: So, John... you, uh, you ready to tell me where you've been the last three years?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: You really don't know?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Well, I know that on the day that Ben here turned the wheel, that you and I were sitting on a log.  There was a bright light.  There was a loud noise, and then you just... you disappeared.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Well, Richard, you're just about to see where I disappeared to.  And after we're finished with that, I'd like you to take me to see Jacob.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: That's... not how it works, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Is that true, Richard?  Is this gonna be a problem?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: You just got back, John.  There's no reason to rush into--
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: I am the leader now.  Right?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Yes, John.  That's right.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Good.  Then I would like you to take me to Jacob.  Can you do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Yeah, of course.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Fantastic.  Let's keep moving.  We're almost to the plane.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: What plane?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: It's a Beechcraft--used to smuggle heroin.  Flew out of Nigeria, crashed here.  All right, Richard, listen very carefully because you're only gonna have about three minutes to get this right.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Get what right?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: A man's about to walk out of the jungle.  He's been shot in the leg.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: You'll need this to get the bullet out.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Uh, I'm sorry, John.  I'm not--
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Now just listen.  This is the important part.  You're gonna need to tell him that he has to bring everyone who left back to the Island.  And when he asks how to do that...  You tell him he's gonna have to die.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: Who is that man, John?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Me.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE:  Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Richard?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Richard...  What is happening?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: What's happening is that you're bleeding to death.  Okay, here.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: I need to get the bullet out.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Because you told me there was, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: No, no.  No, I didn't.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Well... you will.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: This must be quite the out-of-body experience.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Something like that.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: Your timing was impeccable, John.  How did you know when to be here?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: The Island told me.  Didn't it ever tell you things?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: No, John.  And clearly it hasn't told you where Jacob is, or you wouldn't need Richard to show you.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: You've never seen him.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Jacob.  You've never seen him, have you?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: What just happened?  Where did you go?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: To give Richard his compass back.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: You want the bullet?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Keep it.  Everything go all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Well, you--you seemed pretty convinced, especially when I said you were gonna die.  I'm certainly glad that didn't have to happen.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Actually, Richard, it did.  We better get back to camp.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: You need to evacuate the Island of all nonessential personnel, and you need to do it...
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: What the hell is going on here?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: Aren't you supposed to be at the Swan right now, Chang?  We're supposed to break ground in less than 20 hours.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: We're under imminent threat.  If we start drilling, there's a high probability of a cataclysmic accident.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: We are drilling and on schedule.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: Horace, you're in charge.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: He's not in charge anymore.  This is my decision, and it's been made.  We keep working.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: Put us on the sub.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER:  He's right.  It ain't safe.  Put the women and children on the sub and get 'em the hell out of here.  And if you put me and Juliet on the sub with 'em... we'll tell you anything you wanna know.  You okay with that, sweetheart?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JULIET: Absolutely.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: You want on that sub, Jim?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RADZINSKY: Draw me a map.  I wanna know exactly where the Hostiles are.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: You two know how to swim?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: Why don't we just go around it?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: No, dear, we need to go in.  We have to swim under the pond to get to the tunnels.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: I'm not going.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: I'm gonna go back and find everyone else.  I...  I can't go any further with you, Jack.  Not this time.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: Kate, you can't go back there now.  They know about us.  They... they tried to kill us.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: And what are you trying to do?  Bye, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ERIK: You're not going anywhere.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK:  No, no, you don't need to do that.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: We're not in the habit of telling our secrets to strangers, then just letting them saunter off.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: You know I don't care about your secrets.  I just wanna leave.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: Look, just put the gun--
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ERIK:  Step away!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: If she wants to leave--
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ERIK: Hey! I said stop!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: --she can leave!
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: What are we doing here, Eloise?  That man just killed one of our own people, and you're acting like it doesn't matter.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: If these people are right about what they're about to do, Richard, it won't matter.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: And what are they about to do?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAYID: So you're telling me you're going to erase the last three years of our lives?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: We can change things, Sayid.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAYID: I don't know if you're aware of this, but I've already changed things.  I killed Benjamin Linus, and we're all still here.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: It's because you didn't kill him.  Sawyer and me took him to the Others so that they could save him.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAYID:  Why did you do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: Why did I do that?  Since when did shooting kids and blowing up hydrogen bombs become okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: The three of us disappeared off that plane and ended up here, ended up now, because this is our chance to change things.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: And if you're wrong, then everyone on the Island dies.  Do you understand that?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: I'm not wrong, Kate.  This is it.  This is why we're here.    This is our destiny.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: Do you know who you sound like?  Because he was crazy, too, Jack.  You said so yourself.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: Well, maybe I was wrong.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: No, you were right.  I'm going back to find the rest of our people, because if I can't stop you, then maybe they can.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MAN:  The submarine departs in 30 minutes.  All evacuees, please proceed to the dock.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JEANNETTE LEWIS:  Come now, Charlotte.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 CHARLOTTE: Just stay with me.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LARA: This is ridiculous.  I can help you.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: No, Lara, you can't.  Just go over there.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LARA: Why are you so angry? 
Lost.Season05.Episode15 DR. CHANG: I want you to leave, now! 
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HURLEY: Why is he yelling at her, dude?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MILES: It's the only way he can get her to leave.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HURLEY: Sorry, man.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JIN: We'd better get going.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MILES: Wait!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Wait--wait a second.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MILES: It's Jim and Juliet.  Why the hell are they... putting them on the sub?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 HURLEY: Don't worry.  It's gonna be okay.  Sawyer always has a plan, right?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: We'll buy Microsoft.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JULIET: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: Then we'll bet the Cowboys in the '78 Super Bowl.  We're gonna be rich.  Look, I'm sorry.  I should've listened to you when you wanted to get on this sub three years ago.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JULIET: I'm glad you talked me out of it.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MITCH: Come on, LaFleur.  Get in.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: Ladies first.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: Good riddance.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK:  If I don't see you the other side, I won't blame you.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: Now take a deep breath and follow Richard under.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: There's an opening in the bottom of the rocks at the far side.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK:  That was a lot further than I thought it was.   Where are we?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: The tunnels.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: You wanna tell me how we're gonna get a bomb out of here?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: The same way we brought it in.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: I assume you don't mean through the pool.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: It's a 12-foot long, 40,000-pound hydrogen bomb.  No, not through the pool.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: I didn't think you'd come.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAYID: Well, if this works, you might just save us all.  And if it doesn't?  At least you'll put us out of our misery.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE:  All right.  Let's get started.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: I'll have a tent prepared for you, John.  We'll get going first thing in the morning.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: I thought we could leave right now.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Now?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: I'm eager.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: We can do whatever you want, but maybe the two of us should go to my tent and talk about--
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Is this everyone?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Well, there's another group at the Temple, but--
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Well, if you don't mind, I would like to talk to everyone here now.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD: Of course.  Be my guest.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Hello, everyone.  My name is John Locke.  I've been told that...  for some time, you all have been accepting orders from a man named Jacob.  And yet, oddly enough, it seems that no one has actually seen him.  Now I'm sure there are very good reasons why his existence and whereabouts are secret.  I just don't know what they are.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: And to be honest with all of you, if there's a man telling us what to do, I want to know who he is.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SUN: This man--Jacob?  Can he tell us how to bring Jin and the rest of our people back here?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Absolutely.  Richard has agreed to show us where we need to go.  So I'm gonna go and see Jacob right now.  And I'd like all of you to come with me.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 RICHARD:  I'm starting to think John Locke is gonna be trouble.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: Why do you think I tried to kill him?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MITCH: We're shovin' off in two minutes.  Appreciate it if you didn't cause us any trouble.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: Wouldn't think of it, Nemo.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JULIET: What are we gonna do when we get to Ann Arbor?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: We ain't going to Ann Arbor.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JULIET: What do you mean?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: These guys ain't cops.  They got no authority over us back in the real world.  So once we dock, wherever we dock... we're free.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JULIET: "Real world."   I don't even know what that means anymore.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER:  Hey, come here.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: Whatever happens, I got your back, remember?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JULIET: I love you.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER:  I love you back.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 PHIL:  Hold on!  Don't close the hatch!  Horace wants her off the Island, too.  We'll let Ann Arbor deal with them.   Actually caught her coming back into town.  Cuff her over there with the others.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 KATE: Hey. 
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAWYER: Hey.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MAN:  Clear the bridge.  All personnel, lay below on the double.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ENGINEER:   We're away.  Engineering, take your stations.  Boat is clear for sea.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MAN:  All hands to your stations.  Prepare to dive.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MAN:  Clear the bridge.  All hands below.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ENGINEER:   Stand by main vents.  Diving position.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MAN:  Dive officer to the com, dive officer to the com.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ENGINEER:  Stand by on ballast tanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MAN:  Ship is secure for dive, repeat, ship is secure for for dive.  Stand by for dive.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ENGINEER:  Ship to dive, please.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 MAN:  Clear engines two and three.  Test two and three.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAYID:  Jack.   I'm sure it's occurred to you that this woman's motivation in helping us detonate a hydrogen bomb is only to annihilate the DHARMA Initiative.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: Yes, but I still trust her.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAYID: Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 JACK: Because 30 years from now, she's the one who's gonna tell us how to get back to the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 SAYID: And that makes you trust her?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 ELOISE: Well... now what?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Beautiful day, isn't it?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: Yes... so far.  Richard had some concerns.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: Concerns about what?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: This pilgrimage to Jacob makes him uncomfortable.  He's expressed... reservations about whether or not you know what the hell you're doing.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: I know we've had our differences in the past, John, but I'm here to follow you now.  So if you need Jacob to help you reunite your people, then I'll do whatever--
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: I'm not interested in being reunited with my people.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: What do you mean?  You told Sun--
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: I know what I told her, but that's not why we're going to Jacob.
Lost.Season05.Episode15 BEN: Then why are we going to Jacob?
Lost.Season05.Episode15 LOCKE: So I can kill him.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MAN IN BLACK: Morning.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Mornin'.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MAN IN BLACK: Mind if I join you?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB:  Please.  Want some fish?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MAN IN BLACK: Thank you.  I just ate.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: I take it you're here 'cause of the ship.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MAN IN BLACK: I am.  How did they find the Island?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: You'll have to ask 'em when they get here.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MAN IN BLACK: I don't have to ask.  You brought them here.  Still trying to prove me wrong, aren't you?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: You are wrong.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MAN IN BLACK: Am I?  They come.  They fight.  They destroy.  They corrupt.  It always ends the same.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: It only ends once.  Anything that happens before that is just progress.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MAN IN BLACK: Do you have any idea how badly I wanna kill you?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MAN IN BLACK: One of these days, sooner or later... I'm going to find a loophole, my friend.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Well, when you do, I'll be right here.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MAN IN BLACK: Always nice talking to you, Jacob.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Nice talking to you, too.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Are you gonna do it?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 TOM: Uh-uh. You do it.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Fine, I'll do it. But you're gonna be lookout, okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 TOM: Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 WOMAN:  Yeah, I mean, we've been farming the land all the way back to Aines Road.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SHOPKEEPER: What you kids got there? Open your bag.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SHOPKEEPER: Mhm. Where'd you get this?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE:  I got it over there.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SHOPKEEPER: I know you. You're Diane Austen's girl...what's your name?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Katie.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SHOPKEEPER: Well Katie, I'm calling your mom, then the cops, because I don't tolerate stealing here, you understand?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MAN : No need to do that. I'll pay for it. I hope this is enough. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SHOPKEEPER: Well, as long as somebody pays for it, I guess there's no harm done.  But I don't want to see you in here ever again without your parents, you understand me?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Thanks, mister.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: You're welcome.  You're not going to steal anymore, are you?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Be good, Katie. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CAPTAIN BIRD:  Welcome aboard, everyone. We will be doing some system checks offshore here before heading out into the open ocean and submerging to our operational running depth. You should be receiving your sedatives and then we will escort you to your sleeping berths.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CAPTAIN BIRD: Have a nice rest, and we'll see you on the other side. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: We have to get out of here.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Outta here? We're underwater. What the hell are you doing here? How'd you get caught?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: I came back to get you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Came back to get me for what?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Where's Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Jack is on his way to blow up a hydrogen bomb.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Why the hell would he do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Does it matter? We have to stop him.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Sorry, but I'll pass.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE:  Did you hear what I just said?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Yeah, I heard you. You just don't get it, Kate. We were happy in Dharmaville 'til y'all showed up. But now that's all over. So we're gonna drink our O.J. and take our chances in the real world. Jack wants to blow up the Island, good for Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Is there anything in there about how we were supposed to move a ten-ton bomb across the Island?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: Actually, it's twenty tons. Fortunately, it seems Faraday never intended freight the device in its entirety.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ELOISE: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: He left detailed instructions on how to remove the plutonium core...and how to detonate it.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Faraday told me that we needed to wipe out some kind of pocket of energy. Is only part of the bomb going to be enough to do that?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: The core itself is a thermonuclear weapon. It'll be more than enough.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: Hey, hey, wait. We sealed that thing up twenty years ago, and we put it underground because it was emitting radiation. Does this sound like a good idea to you, Eloise?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ELOISE: Richard --
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: You're pregnant.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ELOISE: Which is exactly why we have to help them see this through.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ELOISE:  Once the core is removed, then what?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: Then, we have approximately two hours to take it to the Swan site.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Two hours?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: When Faraday returned to the Island, he was very explicit about this timetable.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Well then, we better get moving.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: Who stopped the damn drill!?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CHANG: I did.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: Why?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CHANG: Because when we passed seventy meters, the drill temp went up sixty degrees, and I didn't want it to melt.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY:  Pierre, that's why we have a truck full of water. So cool it down and turn it on. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CHANG: Stuart, we just evacuated the Island of all nonessential personnel. We're in the midst of a possible insurrection. Do you really think this is the ideal time for your experiments?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: I've been working on this project for six years. Designing a station that'll be able to manipulate electromagnetism in ways we only dreamed of.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CHANG: Have you thought about the consequences of drilling into that pocket? We have no idea what we are gonna --
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: If Edison was only worried about the consequences, we'd all still be sitting in the dark. I came to this Island to change the world, Pierre; that's exactly what I intend to do.   Let's get it started! 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: Take five, everybody! We've still got a ways to go to get to Jacob.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SUN: Who's Jacob?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: He's in charge of this Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SUN: You said John was in charge.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: No, I said he was the leader, a title that I've discovered is incredibly temporary. But everyone answers to someone, and the leader answers to Jacob.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SUN: What's he like?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: I don't know, Sun. I've never met him.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: You've been staring for the last ten minutes, Richard. Is there something you'd like to ask me?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: Ben told me that he strangled you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: That is my recollection, yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: He said he was sure you were dead. That he saw your coffin loaded onto that plane that you came back on. How are you alive?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: Well, you've been on this Island much longer than I have, Richard. If anyone should have an explanation, I'd think it would be you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: I - I have been here a long time, John. And I have seen things on this Island that I could barely describe, but I've never seen someone come back to life.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: And I've never seen anyone who doesn't age. Doesn't mean it can't happen.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: I'm this way because of Jacob. And if I had to guess, he's the reason you're not in that coffin anymore.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: I agree completely, Richard. That's why I'm doing this. So I can thank him.  Once I've done that, we're gonna need to deal with the rest of the passengers from the Ajira flight that brought me here.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: What do you mean, 'deal with them'?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: You know what I mean.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE:  Let's go!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: Untie the crate.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: Why'd we even bring this yahoo?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: Because, we might need him.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: For what? He didn't know the answer to the question.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: That doesn't mean he's not important.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: What, you think he's a candidate?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: He's awake.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: How long you been listening to us?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 FRANK: Long enough to wonder what the hell I'm a candidate for.  Who the hell are you people?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: We're friends.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 FRANK: So you smack all your friends in the face with a rifle, shove 'em in a boat, and kidnap 'em?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: Only the ones we like.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM:  Let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 FRANK: What's in the box?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: Your call.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: Open it.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 FRANK: Terrific.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MAN:  Need a pen, son?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JAMES: Yeah, thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Here you go. You can keep it.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: I'm very sorry about your mother and father, James.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 UNCLE DOUG: Come on, Jimmy. We gotta get to the cemetery, okay?  What you writin'?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JAMES: Nothin'.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 DOUG: Dear Mr. Sawyer... You don't know who I am, but I know who you are, and what you done.  Listen to me, Jimmy. I know you're angry at the man that did this to your momma and daddy. And hell, you got every right to be. But you gotta move on, boy. They're gone, and there ain't nothing you can do to change that.  What's done is done. Now promise me you're not going to finish that letter.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JAMES: I promise.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 DOUG: Good.  Come on, let's go say goodbye.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Let me get this straight. Jack sets off the nuke, which somehow...resets everything. So flight 815 never crashes...lands in L.A. safe and sound, and none of this ever happened.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Sawyer, if Jack does this he could kill everyone on the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Yeah, I heard that part.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: And you're okay with that?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: You ain't hearin' me, Kate. I made a choice, and I'm stickin' to it. I decided to leave, and I'm leavin'.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MITCH: Alright, here's your sedatives.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: What the hell did you just do?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: We decided to leave this Island, James, we did. And now we're going back.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Are you serious?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: We can't just let those people die.  You want out? Or do you want to stay here and whine about it?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Unlock the damn cuffs.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CAPTAIN BIRD: Galaga to base. System check is complete. We're locked on a departure bearing and ready to leave the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 VOICE OVER SPEAKER: Roger that, Galaga. Have a safe trip! See you when you return.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Give me your gun.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Appreciate that, captain. Now we need you to surface the sub.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BIRD: What? I can't take this sub up--
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Oh, I think you can.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Once we're gone, proceed on course. Whatever you do, do not take those people back to the Island. Understand?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BIRD: What if Horace tries to contact me, hmm? What am I supposed to say?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: You ain't home.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET:  Go.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 .
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Sayid, is this big enough?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: That'll do.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Are you done with Faraday's journal?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: Take it.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD:  Can I ask you a question?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Sure.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: Over, uh, twenty years ago, a man named John Locke, he walked right into our camp. And he told me that he was going to be our leader. Now I've gone off the Island three times, to visit him. But he never seemed particularly special to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: You said you had a question.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: You know him? Locke?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK:  Yeah. Yeah, I know him. And if I were you, I wouldn't give up on him.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE:  Why haven't you told him yet?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: Told who what?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: Richard. Why haven't you told him about my plans for Jacob?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: If by plans you mean murdering him, John, I assumed you'd want to keep that a secret.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: When did that ever stop you?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: Well, I starting thinking differently about things when my dead daughter threatened to destroy me if I didn't do everything you said.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE:  Whoa, whoa, wait...where did this happen?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: In that cavern, beneath the Temple. When we went to see the monster.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: So you're willing to do whatever I say, no matter what it is?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE:  Well, then. I guess I won't have to convince you after all.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: Convince me to do what?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: I'm not going to kill Jacob, Ben. You are.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: Paris or Rome?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 NADIA: No. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: Florence?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 NADIA: It doesn't matter, as long as we're together!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: Yes it does! It's our anniversary, we have to find the perfect place.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 NADIA: Can we settle for finding my sunglasses?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Excuse me, sir? Could you help me?  I'm sorry, I think I'm lost. Are you from Los Angeles?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: What are you looking for?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 NADIA: I found them!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID:  Nadia! Nadia?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 NADIA:  Take me home, take me home.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: Time is short, let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: Alright, stay back.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: It's one of the DHARMA houses. I'll go first.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ELOISE: Jack, don't misunderstand who's in charge here. I'll go first. Because if someone in that house is a threat, you might hesitate.  But I won't.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: Alright, okay, Eloise, go on, after you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ELOISE: Once we give you the all clear, then you bring the bomb.  We don't want any accidents --
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD:  I'm protecting our leader. Get back. She's gonna be angry when she wakes up, but that's a lot better than being dead. She ordered me to help you, we helped you, now you're on your own. I'm taking her out the way we came in.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID:  After you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 VOICE OVER SPEAKER: We are in a code black! Report with your weapons to your security assignment immediately. If you come into contact with a hostile, you are authorized to use deadly force.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: How the hell are we going to get out of here?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID:  We hide in plain sight. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL: You go over there by the gate, and you get... ...so you guys go.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROGER: Hey! HEY!  You're the son of a bitch who shot my kid!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: Don't fire that weapon, I'm carrying a nuclear de---
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JIN: Get in!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Drive!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: From the looks of the sun, I'd say that's the north shore over there.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: The sun's over there, that's gotta be the west coast.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Really? You got a compass?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: No, do you?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE:  Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: For what?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: For backing me up at the sub.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: No problem.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: I got no idea where the hell we are!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Vincent! Come here! Hey! Hey! How you doin', boy? Haven't seen you since the flamin' arrows three years ago!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Hey! How'd you survive alone out here?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROSE: Oh, hell no. Bernard!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROSE: They found us.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BERNARD: Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MILES: Is that a bomb?!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK:  Try not to move.  I need to stop the bleeding.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: What's going on back there?  Is Sayid okay?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Does he look okay?!  Just keep your eyes on the damn road!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Ah, let's pull over!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MILES: And get shot!  Just drive!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: I don't know where we're going.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: The Swan site.  Head to the Swan.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Why do you want to go there?  If Sayid's shot, shouldn't we--
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Hurley, if you want to save Sayid, take us to the Swan!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: The Swan it is.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JIN: Jack, what's at the Swan?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: I think I found a way to get you back to your wife.  So hold on.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: You're telling me you've just been living out here in the jungle for the past three years, by yourselves?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROSE: Uh-huh.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, I'm sorry y'all got left behind.  Didn't you hear me shout out, "Meet at the creek"?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BERNARD: You mean with flaming arrows raining down around us, killing everyone we knew?  Oh, sure, we heard ya.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, we spent all sorts of time looking for ya.  I had Jin out searching the Island grid by grid.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROSE: Yeah, we know.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: You know?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROSE: Oh, sure, you guys all joined up with the DHARMA Initiative.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, damn, I could've brought both y'all in.  Why didn't you find a way to tell us you were out here?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROSE: Because we're retired.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: So y'all been scavenging food and living out in a hut by yourselves.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROSE: People try their whole lives to get themselves a nice, quiet place near the ocean where they can live in peace.  And we did it.  That's what we made for ourselves.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, I hate to rain on your parade, but... your condo's about to go ka-blooey.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Jack has a bomb.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROSE: Who cares?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROSE: It's always something with you people.  Now you say Jack's got a bomb.  And what, you guys are all gonna try to stop him, right?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Yeah, that's right.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROSE: We traveled back 30 years in time, and you're still trying to find ways to shoot each other?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Rose, we just need to know which way the DHARMA Barracks are from here so we can stop Jack, or you're gonna be dead.  We all will.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BERNARD: So we die.  We just care about being together.  That's all that matters in the end.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROSE:  The Barracks are 5 miles that way.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Bernard. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BERNARD: Sawyer.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Rose. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ROSE: Thank you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Bye.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BERNARD: You sure you don't want some tea?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Maybe another time.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LAPIDUS: I wish you'd never showed me what was in this damn box.  What the hell you gonna do with it anyway?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: We need to show it to somebody.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LAPIDUS: What for?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: So they'll know what they're up against.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LAPIUS: What exactly are they up against?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: Something a hell of a lot scarier than what's in this box, Frank.  Don't worry, though.  As long as you're with us, you're fine.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LAPIDUS: That'd be reassuring if I knew who you were, "friend".
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: We are the good guys.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LAPIDUS: In my experience, the people who go out of their way to tell you that the good guys are the bad guys.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: We're here.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: Look at the ash!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: Wait here.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 NURSE: Как себя чувствуете? Пить хочется? 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 NURSE: К Вам кто-то пришёл. Я ему объяснила, в каком Вы состоянии... Но он всё равно настоял на том, чтобы увидеться с Вами.  У Вас ещё не было посетителей. Вам это пойдёт на пользу. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Извини, что не смог прийти раньше 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: Я очень рада тебя видеть 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: I'm here because I need your help.  Can you do that?  Will you help me, Ilana?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: He isn't there, hasn't been in a long time.  Someone else has been using it.   Burn it!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LAPIDUS: I'm no tree hugger or anything, but that's a pretty good way to torch the whole jungle, don't you think?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: So what now?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRAM: Well, I guess we know where we're going.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 WOMAN: Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Call 9-1-1!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Don't worry, everything's gonna be alright. I'm sorry this happened to you. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SUN: This is our old camp.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: Home sweet home.  Alright, everyone! Richard tells me we should get to where we're going by nightfall. So why don't you all take this opportunity to rest up and catch your breath. Considering what I have planned for you, you're gonna need it.  Everything alright?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: I was enjoying some alone time.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: You see what's behind you?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: It's a door. How about that?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: Not just a door, Ben. It's the door to the hatch. Where you and I first met.  Do you mind if I ask you a question?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: I'm a Pisces.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: What happened that day at the cabin? When you first took me to meet Jacob?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: Well, you clearly already know that I was talking to an empty chair, John. That I was pretending. Which is not to say that I wasn't as surprised as you were when things started flying around the room.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: But why would go to all the trouble to make something like that up?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: I was embarrassed. I didn't want you to know that I had never seen Jacob. So yes, I lied. That's what I do.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: Alright, then.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: Why do you want me to kill Jacob, John?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: Because, despite your loyal service to this Island, you got cancer. You had to watch your own daughter gunned down right in front of you. And your reward for those sacrifices? You were banished. And you did all this in the name of a man you'd never even met. So the question is, Ben, why the hell wouldn't you want to kill Jacob?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SUN: 처음 본 그 순간부터 당신을 사랑했어요. 그리고 앞으로 함께 살아갈 미래의 당신도 사랑합니다. 이 반지로 당신에게 서약합니다. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JIN: 난 적어 가지고 왔는데 괜찮겠지? 당신과 내가 평생 함께 한다는 의미로 '영원히 함께 하길'이라고 우리 결혼반지에 새겼어. 이 반지로 당신에게... 서약합니다. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SUN: 이모! 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 AUNTIE: 이제 결혼도 했으니까 아이는 언제나 가질거니? 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SUN: 허니문 베이비가 될지도 모르죠. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: 두 분 결혼을 축하합니다. 두 분의 사랑은 아주 특별한 것입니다. 절대로 당연하게 생각하시면 안됩니다. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SUN: 누구에요? 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JIN: 누군지 몰라도, 한국말은 잘하네. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: How much further?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Uhh...we're about five minutes away!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID:  You can't stop the bleeding.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK:  I need fresh dressings.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MILES: Jack! So this bomb is supposed to what, blow us back in time?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: We're not going back in time.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MILES: Right, because that would be ridiculous!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: I need to modify the bomb. I can make it so it detonates on impact. Jack, we need to be there at the moment of the Incident, or all this will be for nothing.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Why the hell are we stopping?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: That's why.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: What is it?  Why are we stopping?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: You'll see.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: Well, it's a wonderful foot, Richard, but what does it have to do with Jacob?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: It's where he lives.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: What's going on, Kate?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Doc, we gotta talk.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: You wanna talk?  Then get in the van.  We don't have time--
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: I ain't gettin' in the van.  I need five minutes, that's all.  I'll say what I gotta say, and then you can do whatever the hell you want to.  But you're gonna listen.  You owe me that much, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Five minutes.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 NURSE: Dr. Shephard?  You all right?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: The dural sac--I cut it.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Give me some suction.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: Calm down.  It's all right.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: The fluid's leaking everywhere.  I can't--
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: Look at me.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Give me some suction.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 WOMAN: Yes, doctor.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: Jack... look at me.  Count to five.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: I'm talking about you stitching up the sac so this girl isn't paralyzed for the rest of her life.  And the only way you're gonna do that is not to be afraid.  So close your eyes, count to five, and then fix her, Jack.  Or I'll have to fix her for you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: One...  two... three... four... five.  Sutures.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: Hey, kiddo.  Girl's in recovery.  She's responsive to stimulus below the waist, so... no paralysis.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Good.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: Something wrong, Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: You embarrassed me.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: Did I?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: You know, it's bad enough that everybody in this hospital thinks the only reason I got this residency is because you're my father.  But then you...  you put me in a time-out during my first major procedure, in front of my entire team.   Dad, I know you don't believe in me, but I need them to.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: Are you sure I'm the one who doesn't believe in you, Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: One of these yours?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK:  Machine got stuck.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: I guess it just needed a little push.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Take a load off, Doc.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: No, thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Sit down, Jack.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: My folks died when I was 8 years old.  I ever tell you that?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Con man took my dad for everything he had.  He didn't deal with it very well.  He shot my mom, then he blew his own head off.  I was hiding under the bed when it happened.  I heard the whole thing.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Yeah.  That was a year ago.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Right now it's July 1977, which means that happened last year.  So I could've hopped on the sub, gone back to the States, walked right in my house and stopped my daddy from killing anybody.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Why didn't you?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Because, Jack... what's done is done.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: It doesn't have to be that way.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: What did you screw up so bad the first time around you're willing to blow up a damn nuke just for a second chance?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: That's not what this is about.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Then what is it about?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Three years ago, Locke told me that all this was happening for a reason, that us being here was our destiny.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: I don't speak "destiny".  What I do understand is a man does what he does 'cause he wants something for himself.  What do you want, Jack?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: I had her.  I had her, and I lost her.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Kate?  Well, damn, Doc, she's standing right on the other side of those trees.  You want her back, just go and ask her.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Nah, it's too late for that.  Your five minutes is up.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Jack... if what you're doin' even works, you and Kate will be strangers, and she'll be in damn handcuffs.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, I guess there's nothing I can say that's gonna change your mind.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: No, I guess there's not.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Who the hell do you think you are?!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: You think you can come here and do whatever the hell you want?  I had a life here!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Sawyer listen. You don't get it--
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Will you stop?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Will you stop?!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Aah! 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: James!  Let him go.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: He wouldn't listen.  I had to.  He won't stop!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: That's because he's right.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: What?!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: He's right, James.  We have to do this.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: What are you talking about?!  You're the one that told me to come back here and stop him!  What happened?!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: I changed my mind.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MOTHER: Girls... your dad and I have something we need to talk to you both about.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BLONDE SISTER: Are we moving again?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BRUNETTE SISTER: No, stupid.  They're getting a divorce.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MOTHER: Rachel--
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RACHEL: Well, aren't you?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MOTHER: Yes.  But... we need you both to understand that your father and I... we still love each other.  Just because two people love each other, doesn't always mean they're supposed to be together.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BLONDE SISTER: But what if you are supposed to be together?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MOTHER: We're not, honey.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BLONDE SISTER: But how can you know for sure?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MOTHER: We just know.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MOTHER: And when you're a grown-up, you'll understand.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BLONDE SISTER: I don't wanna understand!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MOTHER: Juliet, wait!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: I don't wanna understand!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Stop!  We gotta talk about this!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: There's nothing to talk about, James.  We have to let Jack do what he came here to do.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, maybe you shoulda told me you had a change of heart before I brought him out in the jungle to kick his ass.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Would that have stopped you?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: No.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Well, then I'm glad you finally got it out of your system.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Hey!  Hey!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: You, don't.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: I need you to tell me where all this is coming from.  I mean, one minute, you're leading the great sub escape, and now you're on board with blowing up the damn Island?  I got a right to know why you changed your mind.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: I changed my mind when I saw you look at her.   Don't. Don't.   Don't.  Don't.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: I don't care who I looked at.  I'm with you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: And you would stay with me forever if I let you, and that is why I will always love you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: You don't--
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: What we had, it was just for a little while, and just because we love each other, it doesn't mean that we're meant to be together.  I mean, maybe we were never supposed to be together.  So if Jack can make it that--that none of you ever come here, then he should.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Why you doing this, Juliet?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET:  I... if I never meet you, then I never have to lose you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 DR. CHANG: Radzinsky!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: What is it now?!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 DR. CHANG: The gauss readings has jumped off the charts.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: Let me see.  This is it!  We're on top of the pocket!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 DR. CHANG: If we keep drilling and hit that pocket, all hell is gonna break loose!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL:  Radzinsky, are you there?  Over.  Stuart, come in!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: What do you want, Phil?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL: That Hostile that shot the kid?  He came back.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: What the hell are you talking about?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL: Here at the Barracks.  He--he attacked us and then got rescued by some of the other recruits.  They stole a van and took off.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: Took off where?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL: I don't know, but Roger said that one of them had a bomb.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: That Hostile knows about the Swan!  Get some men and some guns, and get your asses out here right now!  If they're coming here, we're gonna be ready for 'em.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Jack?  What happened?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Uh...   Yeah, my talk with Sawyer didn't go so good. 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Does it hurt?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Ah, it's okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Do you remember when I sewed you up? When we first got here?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Yeah.  Seems like a million years ago.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Or 30 years from now.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Kate, why'd you make me promise to never ask about Aaron?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Because I was... so angry with you for making me come back here.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Is he why you came back?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: I came back so he could be where he belongs--with his mother.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: If this works, Claire will never come to the island, and they'll always be together, just the way they're meant to be.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: She was gonna give him up for adoption, Jack.'
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Well, you don't know what she would do.  And whatever it is, it would be her choice.  If you wanna save Claire, this is the only way to do it.  But nothing... nothing in my life has ever felt so right.  And...   I just need you to believe that.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL: Go!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: Keep going!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: Keep the drill going!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: It's about to happen.  Are you with me on this?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Yes.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Then let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MAN: Copy that.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JAIL CLERK: One wallet.  $227 cash.  One ballpoint pen.    One fruit roll-up.  Sign here.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: You don't understand.  This is a big mistake.  I killed a bunch of people.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JAIL CLERK: You see this?  This is a discharge form.  You've been cleared.  So take your stuff and go.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Look, dude... there are men with tranquilizer guns hunting me down like an animal.  They wanna bring me somewhere against my will.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JAIL CLERK: There's a cab stand right out front.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Oh.  Sorry.  I didn't see it was taken, dude.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Actually, I'm only going a few blocks if you wanna share.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Cool.  Are you sure?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Come on in.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: You want some?  Cherry.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: No thanks.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: So what were you in for?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Excuse me?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Jail.  I was there 'cause I killed three people.  But I didn't really.  I guess they figured it out.  What about you?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: I wasn't in jail.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Well, then what were you doing sitting outside a prison?  In a cab?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: I was waitin' for you, Hugo.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Oh.  Then you must be dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: I'm definitely not dead.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Well, what do you want from me?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: I wanna know why you won't go back to the Island.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: 'Cause I'm cursed.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Is that so?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Uh-huh.  That's why the plane crashed, my friends died--Libby, Charlie.  Now they visit me, and I can't make it stop.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Well, what if you weren't cursed?  What if you were blessed?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: How do you mean "blessed?"
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Well, you get to talk to people you've lost... seems like a pretty wonderful thing to me.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Oh, I'm sure it's wonderful, except for the part where I'm crazy.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB:  I've got some news for you, Hugo, and you're just gonna have to take my word on this.  You are not crazy.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Who are you, dude?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB:  I'm just up here on the corner.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB:  Ajira Airways Flight 316 out of LAX.  Leaves in 24 hours.  All you have to do is get on that plane.   It's your choice, Hugo.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Wait!  You forgot your guitar.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: It's not my guitar.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Don't worry, dude.  Everything'll be fine when Jack changes the future... or the past.  One of those.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MILES: I don't think your buddy's gonna make it.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JIN: He'll make it.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 HURLEY: Dude, what happened to your face?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Nothin'.  We were just up on a ridge where we could look down into the Swan site.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Something just happened down there.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: They hit something.  It's time for me to go.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: It's all set to go.  Remember, be careful.  It's rigged to explode on impact.  According to Faraday's plan, you must get the bomb as close as you can to the source of electromagnetism.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK:  Sayid, this is gonna work.  And it'll save ya.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAYID: Nothing can save me.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: See ya in Los Angeles.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: Are you sure you need to do this?  If you waited, Jacob would eventually come to you, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: I'm tired of waiting.  Where is he, Richard?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SUN: What happened to the rest of the statue?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: I don't know.  It was like that when I got here.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SUN: Do you expect me to believe that?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: Not really.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: All right, Ben, let's go.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: W--what are you doing?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: John wants me to join him.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: You can't bring him in.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: Why not?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: Because only our leader can request an audience with Jacob, and there can only be one leader on the Island at a time, John.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: I'm beginning to think you just make these rules up as you go along, Richard.  Ben is coming in with me, and if that's a problem, I'm sure Jacob and I can work it out.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: Tell him I said hello.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: Will you be able to do this, Ben?  I know it won't be easy, but things will change...  once he's gone.  I promise.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MILES: Can I ask you something, LaFleur?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: There ain't no more LaFleur, Enos.  Go ahead, shoot.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MILES: Has it occurred to any of you that your buddy's actually gonna cause the thing he says he's trying to prevent?  Perhaps that little nuke is the incident?  So maybe the best thing to do... is nothing?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MILES: I'm glad you all thought this through.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: What's going on?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JIN: It's Phil. That's the road to the Swan.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: If they see Jack, they're gonna kill him.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: What do you think, Blondie?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Live together, die alone.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: Good for you.  You got here fast.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL: Any sign of 'em yet?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: No, not yet.  You got time to set up a perimeter.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 DR. CHANG: You called these men to the site?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL:  You, rear ridgeline.  You, top ridgeline.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 DR. CHANG: We need to be getting people away from here!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL: You, top of the scaffolding.  Go now!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL: There!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: Get him!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL: Flank him!  Get him now!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: Who's this?!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 WORKER: Uhh!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER:  Drop it, Phil, or you're a dead man!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL: Okay, okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Tell 'em to put their guns down.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL:  Drop the guns!  Drop the guns!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: All right, you can come out now, Doc!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Hurry up and do your business.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Turn that damn thing off!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: What's the matter?!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 DR. CHANG: It won't shut down!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Why not?!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 DR. CHANG: Something's pulling the drill down.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY: We hit the pocket!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Hurry up, Doc!  What are you waiting for?!  Drop it!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER:  This don't look like LAX.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 DR. CHANG:  Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MILES: Dad!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 DR. CHANG: Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACK: Uhh!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Jack!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MILES: Dad!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 MILES:  Get away from here!  Get as far away from here as you can!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADZINSKY:  Get in!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 WORKER: What the hell's going on?!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 WORKER: Get out of here!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 WORKER: Come on!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 [Radzinsky tries to drive a Jeep away but it is pulled back by the electromagnetism.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RADSINSKY: Go! Go! Go!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 PHIL: Hey, LaFleur!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Aah!  Help!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Juliet!  Ah, come on! Sawyer!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Help! 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Juliet!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE:  Sawyer!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Uhh!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Where do you think you're going, Blondie?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET:  Aah! It hurts! Aah!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Kate!  Help me get those chains off!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Hold on!  You hold on!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET:  I can't. I can't get it off.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: I got you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE:  I can't...
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: I can't reach them.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: You hold on!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: Aah! No! 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Please! I got you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Sawyer!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Don't you leave me.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET:  It's okay.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Don't you leave me! You hold on!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET:  I love you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: No, you don't let go!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: I love you, James.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Don't let go.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET: I love you so much.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: No!  No, don't let go!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Juliet! No! 
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: Water?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SUN: Do you have any alcohol?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD:   No.  Sure wish I did.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: Don't shoot.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: It's okay.  It's all right.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: Which one of you is Richardus?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: It's Richard, actually.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: What lies in the shadow of the statue?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD:  Ille qui nos omnes servabit.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: Richard... I'm Ilana.  I have something you need to see.   Open it up.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: It--it's okay.  It's okay.  Let them.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 [They open the crate and tip the contents onto the sand. Richard and Sun peer over the crate to see a body.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 RICHARD: Where did you find him?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 ILANA: In the cargo hold of the plane we came here on... in a coffin.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SUN: I don't understand.  If this is Locke... who's in there?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: You like it?  I did it myself.  It takes a very long time when you're making the thread, but, uh... I suppose that's the point, isn't it?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: Hello, Jacob.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Well, you found your loophole.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: Indeed I did.  And you have no idea what I've gone through to be here.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: Have you met before?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: In a manner of speaking.  Do what I asked you to, Ben.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: Benjamin... whatever he's told you, I want you to understand one thing.  You have a choice.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: What "choice"?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: You can do what he asked, or you can go, leave us to discuss our... issues.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN: Oh... so now, after all this time, you've decided to stop ignoring me.  Thirty-five years I lived on this island, and all I ever heard was your name over and over.  Richard would bring me your instructions--all those slips of paper, all those lists--and I never questioned anything.  I did as I was told.  But when I dared to ask to see you myself, I was told, "You have to wait.  You have to be patient."  But when he asked to see you?  He gets marched straight up here as if was Moses.  So... why him?  Hmm?  What was it that was so wrong with me?  What about me?!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: What about you?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 BEN:  Oh.   Well...
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB:  They're... coming.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season05.Episode16 LOCKE: I can't hear you.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JACOB: They're coming.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: Juliet!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Sawyer, get off of there!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: We have to go right now.  We need to go!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Get off. It's going down!  This thing is gonna go!  You have to let it go. You have to go!  This thing is going to blow at any second.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 SAWYER: No!
Lost.Season05.Episode16 KATE: Jack! Jack, help me get him off.
Lost.Season05.Episode16 JULIET:   Come on!  Come on!   Come on!  Go!  Come on!  Come on!  Come on, you son of a bitch!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY: So how's the drink?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Uh... it's good.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY: That's not a very strong reaction.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Well, it's--it's not a very strong drink.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY: Don't tell anyone.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: It'll be our secret.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY:  Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the "fasten seat belts" sign.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY:  Please return to your seats and keep your seat belts fastened.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ROSE: It's normal.  My husband said the planes want to stay in the air.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Sounds like a smart man.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ROSE: You be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Well, I'll keep you company until he does. Don't worry--
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ROSE: You can let go now.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ROSE: It's okay.  You--you can let go.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Looks like we made it.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ROSE: Yeah.  We sure did.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 NORRIS:  Sorry about the unexpected bumps, folks.  We just hit a pocket of rough air.  It should be a smooth ride from here on out.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BERNARD:  Remind me to hold it next time, will ya?   I almost died in that bathroom.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BERNARD: Now I know how the laundry feels when it's in the dryer.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ROSE: I missed you.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BERNARD: I missed you, too, beautiful.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Excuse me.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DESMOND: Oh, I'm sorry, mate.  Is this your seat?  The stewardess said it was empty.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: No.  No, I'm at the window.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DESMOND: Oh, right.   Listen, mate, do you mind if I sit here?  It's just the fella next to me has been snoring ever since we took off from Sydney.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK:  Yeah, no problem.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DESMOND: Thanks, brother.  Something wrong?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: No.  No, you just...   Do I know you from somewhere?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DESMOND:   Well, I'm not sure.  Desmond.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK:  Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DESMOND: Nice to meet you, Jack...  or to see you again.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET: Aah!  No!  No!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Juliet!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET: Aah!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: I got you.  No, don't let go!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET: Aah!

Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES:  Hey!  Hey!  Kate!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: It's okay.  It's me, miles.  It's okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Where are we?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: I can't--I can't hear you.  Are your ears ringing?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: What is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: We're back.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: Back where?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: Is that the construction site?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: No.  That's the Swan hatch... after Desmond blew it up.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: Guess we're not in 1977, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Jack?  Jack.  Can you hear me?  Jack!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: What happened?  Where are we?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: At the hatch.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: What?  They built it?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Yeah.  They built it.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Sawyer!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Uhh!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: You were wrong!  That's the damn Swan hatch--blown up just like we left it before we started jumping through time!  You said we could stop it from ever gettin' built!  That our plane would never crash on this Island!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Stop it!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: This ain't LAX!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Stop it!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: You blew us right back where we started!  Except Juliet's dead.  She's dead, you son of a bitch, 'cause you were wrong.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK:  Sawyer...  I'm sorry.  I thought we were supposed to...  I thought it would work.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Well, it didn't!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: You in line?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MARS: No, I'm just waiting for my friend.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Oh!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Whoa.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: I'm sorry. I didn't...
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK:   It's okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: I didn't see you there.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: It's okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MARS: Let's get back to our seats, sweetheart.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MARS: Mmm.  Lasagna.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MARS: No.  No knife and fork for you, honey.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: What do you think I'm gonna do, stab you and run?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MARS: Hey, watch we're you're going, buddy.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER:  Sorry.  My bad.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ARZT: Say it.  Come on, please?  Just once.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: I really don't want to, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ARZT: I love those commercials.  Come on.  Just do the Australian accent, and I'll leave you alone.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: All right.  Fine.  All right.   Oi!  Have a cluckity-cluck day, mate!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ARZT:  You know who this is?  This is--this is the owner of Mr. Cluck's Chicken.  And he's--and he's back here riding coach with the rest of us yutzes! Huh? 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: How about that?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ARZT: Hey, um, do you mind me asking, how exactly did a guy like you get to own a major corporation?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: I won the lottery and I like chicken, so I bought it.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ARZT: Oh.  Good.  Good for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: You know, you really shouldn't tell people you won the lottery.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Yeah?  Why not?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Cause they'll take advantage of you.  That's why not.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Thanks for the advice, dude, but it's not gonna happen.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: It's not, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Nope.  Nothing bad ever happens to me.  I'm the luckiest guy alive.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY:  What just happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: I found a flashlight.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Dude, who cares?  The sky just went from day to night.  What happened?!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: I think we moved through time.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: How do you know that?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: White flash.  Headache.  Can't hear.  Happened to me before.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: What about Jack and everyone else?  Did they move through time, too?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: I don't know.  They took one of the other vans and went up to the worksite.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: And then I heard gunfire--
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Shh!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER:  You said that our plane would never crash on this Island!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: You hear that, dude?  It's Sawyer.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: Stay here with Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: The bomb must've gone off.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: You think an atom bomb went off, we'd still be standing here?!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: That's right!  You don't!  For once, you don't know!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: Jack! Sayid needs help.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Where is he?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: With Hurley at the van.  Two minutes away.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET:  Help.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: He's still bleeding.  We don't know what to do.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET: Help me.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: So what do you say, doc?  Got another great idea to save Sayid?  Maybe there's a nuke laying around.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Hey, shut up!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET: Help.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Juliet!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET: James?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Oh, my God.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Juliet!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Oh, God.  Oh, God, this is gross.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Don't worry, dude.  Everything's gonna be fine.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAYID:  When I die...  what do you think will happen to me?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Just--just try not to talk, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAYID:  I've tortured more people than I can remember.  I murdered.  Wherever I'm going...    it can't be very pleasant.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Sayid, come on.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAYID: I deserve it.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Hello?  Jin?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Jin!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: I've got a gun!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: And I know how to shoot it!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACOB: Hello, Hugo.  You got a minute?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: 저 사람들을 뭘 쳐다봐? 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SUN: 아니... 그냥 너무 행복해보여서요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: 단추 채워라. 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BOONE: You're wasting your time, man.  This plane goes down in the ocean way out here, I think our chances of survival are exactly zero.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Actually, in calm seas w-with a good pilot, we could survive a water landing.  And, uh, the fuel tanks are buoyant enough to keep us afloat until we got in the life rafts...
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BOONE: No, it's just impressive you know that.  So what were you doing in Australia?  Business or pleasure?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Pleasure. You?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BOONE: I went down to get my sister out of a bad relationship that it turns out she didn't want to get out of.  So... here I am.  So what, you were just Down Under for vacation?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Actually, I went on a walkabout.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BOONE: Really?  Like--like Crocodile Dundee?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE:  No, not exactly.  But--but, uh, it was pretty intense.  We--we spent ten days in the Outback and, uh, nothing but our packs and our knives.  We slept under the stars and made our own fires, hunted our own food.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BOONE: Wow.  I wouldn't make it two days without my cell phone.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BOONE: You're not pulling my leg, are ya?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Why would I pull your leg?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BOONE: This thing goes down, I'm sticking with you.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: You can stop staring at the fire.  Jacob's gone.  He's gone.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: Why didn't he fight back?  Why did he let me just kill him?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: I guess he knew that he was beaten.  Ben... I want you to go outside and tell Richard that I need to talk to him.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: Talk to him about... what?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: That's between me and Richard.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: There's no other reason.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BRAM: No, that's not how it's gonna be.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: You have to--you're not going in there.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: No 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: Just back up a little.  Okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SUN: Who are they?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LAPIDUS: Other than the fact that I know they were on the Ajira flight with us, all I know is they knocked me out and dragged my ass to some cabin, which they promptly burned, then... brought me here along with the dead guy in the box.  They say they're the good guys.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LAPIDUS: I'm not buying it either.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: Listen to me.  Hey!  Listen to me, and listen carefully.  No one goes in there unless Jacob invites them in.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ILANA: Richard, that's why we're here, because Jacob invited us.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: Asking me what's in the shadow of the damn statue doesn't mean you're in charge.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ILANA: Then who is?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: Richard. 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: Ben.  What happened in there?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: Everything's fine.  John wants to speak to you.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ILANA: Is Jacob all right?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: I'm sorry. Who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: Answer her question, Ben.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: Well, of course Jacob's all right.  They're both together inside.  John just wants to talk to you.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: John wants to talk to me?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: That's right.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: Richard, what are you doing?  I don't understand.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: Well, I'm happy to talk to John.  But before I do, maybe you should talk to him first.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Hang on, Juliet! We're comin'!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Jin! Flashlight!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: If we can move this beam, I think I can get down there.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: It's too heavy... we need something to pull it. Jin! The van. There's chains in it. Go get 'em!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Where you goin', dude? And what are you doin' here? I mean... I meet you in a taxi and you know everything about me and you give me a plane ticket which just so happens to get me back on this Island. How'd you know that was gonna happen?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Hello? Can you hear me? Why aren't you answering my questions?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Look, my friend Jin is gonna be here any second so you better stop ignoring--
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACOB: Your friend Jin won't be able to see me.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Why not?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACOB: Because I died an hour ago.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Sorry, dude, that sucks.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACOB: Thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: How'd you die?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACOB: I was killed by an old friend who grew tired of my company.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: You want me to do something crazy again, don't you?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACOB: No. I need you to save Sayid, Hugo.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Well that's why Jin went to go get Jack...
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACOB: Jin can't help him. You need to take Sayid to the Temple. That's the only chance he's got. And the rest of them will be safe there.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: The Temple? I'm supposed to know what that is?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACOB: Jin knows. Tell him to take you to the hole in the wall where he was with the French team. Through that opening you can get into the Temple. You still have that guitar case I gave you?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Yeah...
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACOB: Bring it.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Who are you, dude?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACOB: I'm Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: Hurley! Help me with Sayid. We have to get him into the van. Juliet needs our help.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: Come on, we have to go!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Jin, if I asked you to take me to where there's, like, a hole in the wall... where you went with the French team... would you know what I was talkin' about?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Good.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: I'll get the chain.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Juliet!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Stop it! Stop, Sawyer! The van is here, the chains are coming.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: She ain't makin' any more noises...
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: No, she knows we're here. She's probably just resting.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Juliet!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: If she dies, I'll kill him.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY:  Ladies and gentlemen, nothing to be alarmed about, but if there is a doctor onboard could you please press your call button?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY: Sir? You're a doctor?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY: Could you come with me please?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY: We appreciate your help. A passenger went into the restroom about half an hour ago and he's not responding when we knock.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY: This man's a doctor. If he's unconscious in there--"
Lost.Season06.Episode01 EMPLOYEE: Well, I think he tampered with the lock, it's... it's jammed or something, I don't know.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAYID: Can I be of assistance?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAYID: Excuse me.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: He's not breathing.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: What's goin' on back there, Earheart?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY: Everything's fine sir, please just stay in your seats.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: ...yeah, looks peachy.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK:  ...Sir, I'm gonna need your help.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAYID: What can I do?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: I need ya  to hold this over his mouth... hold it there and do not let any air escape.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAYID: OK, now?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Yes, now.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Somethings blocking his air passage.  I'm gonna have to open it up. I need, uh, something sharp - a razor...
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: I gotta pen.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAYID: A pen!?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY: It's regulation, there's nothing sharp.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: A pen! Just a pen. I had a pen in my jacket but it's gone. Damnit.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: I got it, I got it. Relax, just relax, breathe.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CHARLIE: Am I alive?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Yeah, you're alive.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CHARLIE:  ...Terrific.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: You got it?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Okay Jin! We're good down here!  ...hit it!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Gimme the flashlight.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Juliet! Okay...I'm comin... Juliet? Hey, I'm here, come on baby, come on wake up.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET: Hi.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Hey.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET: Wh-Wh-Where are we?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Don't worry about that. You're fine. I gotta get you outta here, okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET: It didn't work, we're still on the Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: It's okay, It's okay, I just gotta get this loose enough to get you out, okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET: No, I hit the bomb and you're still here.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: You what? ...You hit the bomb? Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET: I wanted you to be able to go home. I wanted to make it so you never came to this damn Island  ...it didn't work.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Don't you worry about that. You're gonna be OK. I'm gonna get you outta here and we're all gonna go home together, you hear me?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Sawyer!?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Even if I could get the bullet out, bleeding won't stop, there's nothing I can do for him.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: There's somethin' I can do. There's a temple, if we can get Sayid there we can save him.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: And you know this how?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: This guy Jacob told me just before we got here.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Who's Jacob?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Does it matter? Can you fix Sayid, Jack?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Then you're gonna have to let me do it.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: Ben, you need to talk to me. I can't stop them unless you tell me what happened in there. What happened to Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: You and I have known each other for 30 years Ben, I'm asking you this as a friend.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: You wanna know what happened Richard? Why don't 'cha go inside and find out.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: What are ya doin?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BRAM: We're goin in, and he's comin' with us.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Where's Richard?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: He's not coming.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Then who is that behind you?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BRAM: Where's Jacob?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Jacob is dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BRAM: Who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Don't worry about me. Let's talk about you. I'm assuming that you are, what? Jacobs bodyguards? And that you came all the way to this Island to protect him? Well I have good news, Jacob burned up, right there in that fire. Therefore there's nothing left for you to protect. You can go. You're free.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BRAM: Kill him! Spread out! Get him! ...where is he?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: I'm sorry you had to see me like that.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Sawyer!? Is she ok?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Working on it!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Okay, okay, I got'cha, I got'cha. Don't worry.

Lost.Season06.Episode01 JULIET: I have to tell you something, it's really really important.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: You tell me... you tell me...
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Juliet? You tell me  ...oh...oh my god 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: You did this.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CHARLIE: Should'a let that happen man, I was supposed to die.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY: Don't take it personally, some people just don't know how to say thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Excuse me, do you know what happened to the guy that was sitting next to me?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 ROSE: Um, we were asleep.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 NORRIS:  Ladies and Gentlemen, captain Norris here, we're now beginning our final descent into Los Angeles international airport, I'm happy to tell you it's a beautiful day in Los Angeles, 72 degrees, 6 miles visibility and winds outta the south-west at 5 miles an hour.

Lost.Season06.Episode01 NORRIS: I'll be putting on the fasten seat belt sign now, we'll be on the ground in just a few minutes, thank you so much for flying Oceanic Air.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: Are we gonna sing Kum Ba Yah on the way?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: It's not a guitar man.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: Then what is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE:  ...you going with them?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: No, I'm gonna bury her.

Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Hey Miles, you mind hangin' back?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: You got it boss.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: I'll make sure to leave a trail so you can follow us.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: I ain't followin' nobody Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY:  You guys ready?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Whenever you are.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 OCEANIC-MALE:  Oceanic passenger Jack Shephard, Jack Shephard, please go to the nearest courtesy desk.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Hi, uh, I'm Jack Shephard, I was just paged?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 OCEANIC-MALE: Oh, Mr. Shephard, hello, yes - that was me, uh, sorry I meant to meet you at the gate.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Well, I'm here now. So...
Lost.Season06.Episode01 OCEANIC-MALE: Mr. Shephard, I'm deeply sorry but there seems to have been a mix up involving the, uh, cargo you checked in Sydney.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Cargo?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 OCEANIC-MALE: Yes sir, a coffin?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: I don't...  ...I don't understand, I mean are you saying that it's not here?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 OCEANIC-MALE: It appears it was never put on the plane.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK:  The funeral is in two hours - when is it getting here?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 OCEANIC-MALE: Mr. Shephard, I can't tell you how deeply sorry we are but we don't know when it will arrive, because we're not exactly sure where it is.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: That's a big wall.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: How're we gonna get him over the top?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: We're not, we're bringing him in through here.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Who brings a book into a cave?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: And why is his arm missing?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: It was ripped off when he was attacked by the black smoke.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Well, this is gonna be awesome.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Watch your step.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Yeah.

Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: That's why you asked me to stay here with you?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: You're the only one around that talks to dead people.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: Jim, that's not how it works.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: What did she wanna tell me Miles?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: Hey...it doesn't matter.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: It does matter.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: It's not gonna help.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Just do it! Just ask her.

Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Hey, excuse me, I carried that case across the ocean and like, through time, so I wanna know what that paper says.

Lost.Season06.Episode01 CUSTOMS-AGENT: And what business are you in sir?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: No English.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CUSTOMS-AGENT: This letter says the watch is a business gift, can you tell me what business you're in?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: 문제 될 것 없는데... 보내 줄 수 없을까요?  Meeting! 미팅 있어가지고 가야 돼요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CUSTOMS-AGENT: Step back sir.  ...what are you doin' with this? Anything over 10 thousand dollars has to be declared  ...you, didn't, declare this.

Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: 시간이 없다니까! 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CUSTOMS-AGENT: Ann, Take her to the waiting area.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 FEMALE-CUSTOMS-AGENT: Ms. Paik, do you understand any English? Because if you do, if this is just a misunderstanding, you should speak up now. Do you understand me?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SUN: No... English.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: The water isn't clear - what happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  Nani ga okottanoka wakaran 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: What is he doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  Kore ha dareni yarareta noda 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON:  Who did this to him?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: My fault, I didn't shoot him but it's my fault.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  Dekiru kagiri no koto wa suruga, soreniha kiken ga tomonau 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: If we do this there are risks .. you understand?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Do what you have to do.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  Kono otoko wo izumi no nakae 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON:  Take off the coveralls, put him in.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: What are they doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Can unconscious people hold their breath?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: He's awake, let him up.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JIN: What are they waiting for?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: That's enough!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK:  I said, let him up!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: You're not saving him! You're drowning him!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  Kare wa shinda 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: You're friend is dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Jack... Jack, stop, what are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Jack, he's dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: He's not coming back, stop it!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 FROGURT: Woah, woah, woah, I don't think so lady, there's a line. There's a line!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY:   ... Outback is just a name, you sayin' they own the entire outback? That's just stupid.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MARS:  ...she's gonna be coming outta customs I want you guys to take the other door.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MARS: Hey!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Go... go now!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CAB-DRIVER: Lady, I already have a customer.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: I said go.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CLAIRE: Hey. What are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE:  Go now!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MARS: Hey! Stop the cab!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 CINDY: Thought you might like a little something to eat or drink. Zach, Emma, then take the rest to the people over there.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RANDOM-OTHER: Just drop 'em in here.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Hey, what happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: They jumped us in the jungle - he took four of them out, before one of them hit him with a damn rock.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: You, come with me.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Come with you where?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  Kare ni kiitekure, Jacob wa seikaku ni nanto itta noka, donna shiji wo uketanoka 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: He wants to know what Jacob told you.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: He told me to come here. Said you guys would save Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  Kare wa sudeni teokure datta 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: He was beyond saving.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Wait a second - you're not translating anything I say to him - which means you totally understand me dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  I don't like the way English tastes on my tongue.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  De, Jacob wa itsu kurunda 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: When's Jacob getting here?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: What do you mean?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: Is he coming to the temple?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: I really don't think that's gonna happen man.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: Why not?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: You know - cuz he's dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: What - you guys didn't know?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  Zenin haichi ni tsuke!  Kabe no ue ni hai wo youi shiro 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: Everyone to your posts! On the walls, prepare the ash!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  Kigashi no kabe ni shubi wo katamero!  Juunin ha kita ni maware 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: Ten men on the north side!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  Juubun chui shiro! 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: Send the warning!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 DOGEN:  Mina ni konokoto wo tsutaerunda, yoshi tenka! 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: Light it!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Guess we're not getting outta here huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: This isn't to keep you in, it's to keep him out.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Him? Who?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: What are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Wh.. I'm not a what Ben, I'm a who.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: You're the monster.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Let's not resort to name calling.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: You used me... you couldn't kill him yourself, so you made me do it.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: I didn't make you do anything. You should know, he was very confused when you killed him.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: I seriously doubt that Jacob was ever confused.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: I'm not talking about Jacob. I'm talking about John Locke. Do you wanna know what he was thinking while you, choked the life outta him Benjamin? What the last thought that ran through his head was? "I don't understand". Isn't that just the saddest thing you ever heard? But it's fitting in a way, because when John first came to the Island, he was a very sad man. A victim, shouting at the world for being told what he couldn't do, even though they were right. He was weak, and pathetic, and irreparably broken. But, despite all that, there was something admirable about him. He was the only one of them that didn't wanna leave. The only one, who realized how pitiful the life he'd left behind actually was.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 BEN: What do you want?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Well that's the great irony here Ben because, I want the one thing that John Locke didn't. I want to go home.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Goodbye dude, If you ever wanna talk, I'm around.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 MILES: Nothing.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Where are we?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: We're in a temple.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: We got caught by the others again?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: Yeah, only, this time they're protecting us, I think.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Course they are.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: You alright?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: Ah... 
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: I'm so sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 KATE: You know what you said back at the hatch, he's just tryin'a help us.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAWYER: I ain't gonna kill Jack, he deserves to suffer on this rock just like the rest of us.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Yeah... I know...I ... do you think I knew this was gonna happen? I scheduled it so soon because I wanna get it over with. I don't know mom, he's not here so I can't tell you what to tell them other than we can't have the service without him. Yeah - I will call you if I hear anything.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE:  What did you lose?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Well, they lost one of my bags, what about you?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: You wouldn't believe me if I told ya.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Hah, try me.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: They lost my father.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: He died in Australia a couple days ago, and um, I flew down to get him.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: My condolences.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Yo.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Coffin was supposed to go on the plane in Sydney, but it didn't. Apparently he's somewhere in transit which is their way of saying, they have no idea where the hell he is.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Well, how could they know.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: They're the one's that checked him in, I mean they've gotta have some kind of tracking system.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: No I'm not talking about the coffin, I mean how could they know where he is. They didn't lose your father, they just lost his body.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Either way, your story beats the hell outta mine - all that was in my suitcase was a bunch of knives.  Thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Some kinda salesman?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Yeah, something like that. Well it was nice talking to ya, hope ya find that coffin.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Hope you find your knives.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Yeah, thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Mind if I ask what happened to ya?  I'm sorry, I'm only asking because I'm a spinal surgeon, I didn't mean to...
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Oh, no, don't worry about it - uh, uh surgery isn't gonna do anything to help me, my condition is irreversible.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Nothing is irreversible. Umm, if you ever wanna consult, just uh, gimme a call.  - It's on the house.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Well thanks  - Jack Shephard, I'm John - John Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: It's nice to meet ya John.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Nice to meet you too.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: You're welcome.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LAPIDUS: What the hell is that?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD: Don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LAPIDUS: I'm seein' it - But I'm still not believin' it.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Hello Richard. It's good to see you outta those chains.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 RICHARD:  ... you?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: Me.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LOCKE: I am very disappointed ... in all of you.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: You Shephard?
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: We need to speak to you privately.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: If you've got something to say to me then say it, otherwise just leave me alone.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: I don't think you're understanding me here, I'm asking politely, you either get up and come with us on your own, or I'll have ya dragged out. Because we are going to have this conversation and it's not going to be here.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Is that right.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 HURLEY: Jack!
Lost.Season06.Episode01 LENNON: Oh my god.
Lost.Season06.Episode01 JACK: Wha...
Lost.Season06.Episode01 SAYID: What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: He's alive.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MILES: It worked?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 HURLEY: Dude! You're okay!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Hurley, let him breathe. Miles, can you go get some water?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MILES: Yeah, on it.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Sayid, hey, how ya feelin'?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: A little light headed.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: Jack, what happened to me?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK:  You died.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: How is that even possible? I mean one minute he's gone and now he's fine?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: Of course he's fine.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: What's that mean?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER:  He's an Iraqi torturer who shoots kids. He definitely deserves another go around.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 HURLEY: All right.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: What are you lookin' at?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: How many guards with guns do you think are outside this place?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: What?!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: I was out cold when they brought me in here. How many guards did you see? Five? Ten? A hundred?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: What are you thinking?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: Thinkin' about running, Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MARSHAL: She's got hands in handcuffs but she's probably got them covered, okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MARSHAL: Hey!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MAN: Hey! Watch it!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Go! Go now!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CAB DRIVER: Lady, I already have a customer.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Damn it, I said go.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CAB DRIVER: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MARSHAL: Move it!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Oh! Easy, easy, slow down.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Hey, just slow down. Slow down!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CAB DRIVER: Okay! Okay! You said go!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Just get us out of here.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MARSHAL: Hey! Hey! Stop that cab!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Can you please, just let me out of - AH!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Be quiet!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CAB DRIVER: There's a guy. I'm not gonna run him over.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LESLIE ARTZ: Hey! I'm walking here. I'm walking here.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Do not get out of this car!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Just go. Go now! I don't care about the guy! Go!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CAB DRIVER: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LESLIE ARTZ: Hey! Hey! What the hell! Hey, I got your license plate!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: At the light, take a left.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE:  Can you, can you please, please just let me go? I promise I won't say anything to anyone.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Hey! Hey! Damn it!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Please! Please!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Give me your purse.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I said give me your purse!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Now get out of the car.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Can I please just, just get my suitcase?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: No you can't! Get out of the car!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Easy.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: Who are these people? What do they want?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 HURLEY: It's the Others, dude. They caught us  again. I dunno, I think they are trying to protect us.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MILES: Uh, as you can see, Hugo here has assumed the leadership position so that's pretty great.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID:  What?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: The wound  it's almost completely closed.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: Thank you Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: For what?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: For saving my life.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: Nani wa tomoare isogunda 
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON:  Mr. Jarrah, will you come with us, please?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: Come with you where?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: Inside. Nothing to worry about we just...
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK:  I'm coming with him.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: Oh, I'm sorry. We need to talk to him alone, just a few questions.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: You have a few questions? Well, so do we. Let's start with who are you? Why are you holding us here? You ...
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: Kono otoko wo damarasero  
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON:   Once we've spoken to Mr. Jarrah, we'll be more than happy to tell you everything you want to know.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Something tells me that you're not going to be happy telling us anything.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: Tsurete ike 
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: Yamero! 
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON:  Don't shoot! Lower your weapons!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: Please, you don't have to do this. We won't hurt your friend.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER:  He ain't my friend. Do what you want with him and anybody else. But me, I'm walking out of here.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: James.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: I'm gone! You understand?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: Please.  You have to stay.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER:  No, I don't.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER:  Don't come after me.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: Jarrah wa hikiuketa  Nani wo shitemo kamawan  Ford wo tsuremodose.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Hey! Hey! Where are they taking Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: Hey! Calm down! Everybody calm down.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON:  Where'd Ford go?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: Ford, your friend who just ran outta here. Where did he go?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: I don't know.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: Do you expect me to believe that?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: He told me he wanted to kill me. You believe that?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I can bring him back.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: You know where he went?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: No, but I can track him. Let me go. I will bring him back and I can make him stay.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Kate, you sure you want to go out there alone with these people?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: I'll go with her.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: It's very important that he get back here safely. What makes you think he's going to listen to you?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I can be very convincing when I wanna be.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Where's your tire hammer?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 REPAIRMAN: You've got a problem.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: So do you. Where's your tire hammer?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 REPAIRMAN: Tire hammer will just cut off your wrist. The problem is you need a punch press and you're not gonna be able to use one of them and keep that gun pointed at me.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: You volunteering?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 REPAIRMAN: I got a steady hand but I kinda feel like we got off on the wrong foot.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I'll give you two hundred dollars.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 REPAIRMAN: Now hold still.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 REPAIRMAN: So why the bracelets?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I'm wanted for murder.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 REPAIRMAN: Murder?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: You don't happen to have somewhere I can change, do you?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 REPAIRMAN:  Bathroom's over there. Make it quick.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: Better not slow us down.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE:  Better not slow me down.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: I'd go with you but..
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: ...but you thought he would kill you?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I'll take care of James. You take care of Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK:  Deal.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Good bye.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Be careful.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: What is it you want? Please, whatever you are thinking of doing  What is that?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: Just tell me what you want.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID:  Why? Why are you doing this?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: I don't have any secrets. Ask, AHHH!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: Ahhhhh!  Ahhh! 
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: Ugh! Ugh!! Ugh!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: Yoshi,korede juubun da  Shiken ni tootta to ie 
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: We're sorry we had to put you through that. It was a test. We had to be sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: Test to be sure of what?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: Don't worry. You passed.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: I just lied to him, didn't I?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Where were you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Before I got in the cab, where were you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Why, so you can hijack them too?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: I was waiting for a bus.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I came to bring you your stuff.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Relax, I didn't take your money.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Well, uh, gee, thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: So where were you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Don't worry about it.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Fine.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Langdon street. Brentwood.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: You got family there?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Uh, no. It's the couple who's adopting my baby.  They were, um, they were meant to meet me at the airport but I guess they got their days mixed up or something. It's not like they abandoned me.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Brentwood's not far. Get in.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE:  Seriously?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Do you want a ride or not?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: So why do you people want us to stay at the temple?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: We're protecting you.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: From what?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: You've been on this island for a while, right? Ever see a big pillar of black smoke, makes a ticka ticka sound, looks pissed off?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: From that.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: Do you know anything about another plane coming in? An Ajira flight.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: I'm sorry. Is this a press conference?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JUSTIN: I think he means the one that landed...
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: Justin! Shut up.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: No, no, no, that's a decoy trail. He went this way.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: And you're basing this on what?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE:  Experience.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JUSTIN: Aldo.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JUSTIN: I think she's right.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO:  Of course she is.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: After you, princess.  So what's your strategy for bringing your boyfriend back? I hope you got one because he shot a guy on his way out. If he tries that on me, I'm gonna blow his head off.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JUSTIN: Watch it!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: Looks like one of Rousseau's traps.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JUSTIN: The French woman? She's been dead for years. This, this couldn't be one ...
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: Justin! Shut up!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: What was he gonna say?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: You don't even remember me, do you? You don't recognize me? Well maybe this will jog you memory. Three years ago, you staged yourself a little prison break,  and you did it by knocking the guard out with the butt of your rifle. That would be me.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: What are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Escaping.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 [Back at the Temple chamber with the spring. Two men are dragging Sayid. Hurley rushes to Sayid and they give him Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 HURLEY: Sayid! You okay, man? Jack! He's back!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Sayid, what happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: They tortured me.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: Don't know. They didn't ask me any questions.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Step aside.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: Hey, Shephard.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: We were hoping you'd come on your own.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: What the hell did you do to Sayid?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: We, we didn't do anything to him. Your, your friend is sick.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Sick with what?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: Kare wa kegasarete shimatta ]
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: He's  yeah, I,  not really  there's not really a literal translation. The closest thing would be  infected.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Infected? He's not even running a fever.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Did I say something funny?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: I doubt it. He doesn't really have a sense of humor.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 [The Temple Leader smiles and wraps a capsule in a piece of paper.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: Korewo Jarrah ni nomasete moraou
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: He says you have to give your friend this pill.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK:  Are you serious?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Why don't you give it to him?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: Because it won't work unless he takes it willingly, and he won't take it willingly from us.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Well, then maybe you should've asked him to take it before you tortured him.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: We didn't torture him. We were diagnosing him.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: To see if he was infected.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: I'm not gonna give anything to Sayid unless I know what's in it.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: Tell me, Shephard, your friend, how did he get shot?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: He was, um, he was helping me.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: So it was your fault?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: And there have been others who were hurt or died, helping you?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER:  Well, this is your chance to redeem yourself.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: It's medicine and your friend needs it.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: What happens if I don't give it to him?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: The infection will spread.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MILES: So, nothing? There wasn't anything? No white light? Angels singing? No dead relatives?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: I remember being shot.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 HURLEY: You're not a zombie, right?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: No. I am not a zombie.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MILES: Hey.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Mind giving me and Sayid a minute?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 HURLEY: Yeah, see, private talks kinda freak me out 'cause they lead me to having to do something I don't quite understand.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: I'm right there with you.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MILES: Its fine. We'll be in the food court if you need us.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: So did they tell you why they burnt me with a hot poker?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: They said they were trying to diagnose you.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: Right. They told me it was some sort of test which they said I passed. Clearly, I didn't.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: What's that?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: They want you to take it. It's medicine, according to them.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: What about according to you?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: I don't know. And you know, before when you  when you thanked me for saving your life, I, I didn't have anything to do with it Sayid. I didn't fix you. They did.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAYID: I don't care who fixed me. I only care about who I trust. So, if you want me to take that pill, Jack, I'll do it.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: Wait. Where are you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Catching up with Sawyer.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: So you never planned to bring him back to the temple.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: No. I'm not interested in being a prisoner. Are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: Where did your plane land, Kate?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: The Ajira plane that you, Jack and Hurley came in on.  Where did it land?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I don't know.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: Sun was on that plane too and I have to find her.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE:  You think they're gonna tell you? You think they care about you or about Sun or about any of us?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: Who do you care about Kate?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Good luck, Jin.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: Once you catch up with Sawyer, then what?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I guess we'll figure that out together.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: So, uh, what happened to your handcuffs?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I cut them off.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: It's a beautiful neighborhood.  I bet they're a really nice couple.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I didn't say anything.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: What, you, you think they didn't come to the airport on purpose?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Why would I think that?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Good, 'cause they didn't.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: This is it.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Um, will you come in with me?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE:  Are you kidding me?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Please, I just  I really don't want to go up there on my own.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Uh, hi, um, Mrs. Baskum? I, I'm, I'm Claire Little ton.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MRS. BASKUM:  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry. Um,  my husband  he left me.  And, believe me, I wanted a baby so much, but I can't do it alone. I'm sorry. Look, I know I should've called you.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: So uh, wh-what, y-y-you just changed your mind?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 MRS. BASKUM: Um, look, my, my life is just, a little bit complicated right now.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE:  She came all the way from Australia and you don't call?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Oh my God.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Are you okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Aah! It's coming!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: Who's there? Better come out now or so help me, I'm just gonna start shootin'.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: What the hell are you doin' here?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I was worried about you.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 NURSE: What's happening here?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: I-I think I'm having contractions.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 NURSE: When did they start?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Um, about three minutes ago.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 NURSE: Try to relax. We're gonna take you to the M.C.U to get it looked at.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 NURSE:  Are you with her?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 NURSE: Okay, follow me.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: What are you doing? What, what's going on?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 NURSE 2: Hold on. The doctor will be with you in just a moment.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: I need to know what's going on? Is something wrong?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Excuse me. Excuse me.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Are you a doctor?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED: Yes. I'm Dr. Goodspeed.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Can I please get your help in here?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED: Miss Littleton? Claire, how are you feeling?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Uncomfortable. What, wh-what's happening.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED: What's happening is that Mother Nature's gotten a little ahead of herself. Are you ready to have your baby?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: I-I'm sorry. What?!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED: You're at thirty six weeks, three centimeters dilated and about 80% effaced, which means, if you want, you can have your baby tonight.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: If I want? So what, you mean, you mean you can stop it then?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED: Maybe. However, to do that would require a number of drugs.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Drugs? I mean. W-will that hurt the baby?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED: No. They're perfectly safe. I just don't want to stick you with needles if I don't have to. So it's up to you.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: I'm, I'm not ready.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED: Okay. Let's get her started on the Nifedipine drip.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Wh, what, what is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED:  Margaret, let's do an ultrasound. I wanna get a picture of what's going on in there.  Ah, it, it could just mean the baby's out of position.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Wh-wh-what are you, what are you saying?! W-what, what's happening to my baby?!  Is my baby okay? Is Aaron okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED: See?  There he is. Everything is just fine.  Your boy just likes to move around.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED: 140 B.P.M, perfectly normal. I have a feeling that Aaron is gonna be a handful.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED: Now let's see if we can slow this down.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOCTOR GOODSPEED: You did great, mommy. Thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: A couple days ago, you asked me why I came back to the island.  I need to find Claire. I thought  maybe if I could catch up to you, you could help me, and then  maybe if we could find her and bring her back to Aaron, then maybe all of this wouldn't be for nothing.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I'm sorry. I never should have followed you.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: Which time?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE:  That was your house, right? With Juliet.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER:  Yep.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: You already said that.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: No  for Juliet. If I hadn't come after you on the sub, then you two would've left and she would've never died.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: It's not your fault she's dead. It's mine.  She was sittin' right there, right where you are now, tryin' to leave this place. And I convinced her to stay. I made her stay on this island  'cause I didn't want to be alone.  You understand that, right?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: But, uh,  but I think some of us are meant to be alone.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: I was gonna ask her to marry me.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 SAWYER: You can probably make it back to the Temple by nightfall.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: What's that?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: It's a baseball.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: You speak pretty good English for someone who needs a translator.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: We both know that I don't need a translator.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Then why do you have one?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 TEMPLE LEADER: Because I have to remain separate from the people I'm in charge of. It makes it easier when they don't like the decisions I make for them.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: My name is Dogen.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Are you from here, the island?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: I was brought here like everyone else.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: What do you mean, "Brought here."?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: You know exactly what I mean.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: You didn't give your friend the pill, did you?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: Why not?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Because I don't know what's in it.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: It will eliminate--
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK:  --the infection, yeah. I got that. But what's in it?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: I cannot explain.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Try.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: There isn't any time. He'll die if you don't...
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK:  He already died.  What is in it?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN:  You just have to trust me.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK:  I don't trust myself. How am I supposed to trust you? Let's see where trust gets us.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Now, are you gonna tell me what's in it?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: Poison.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Come in.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DETECTIVE RASMUSSEN.: Excuse me. Ms. Littleton?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Um, yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DETECTIVE RASMUSSEN: I'm Detective Rasmussen.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DETECTIVE RASMUSSEN: Is Ms. Hart here?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Uh, I'm sorry. Who?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DETECTIVE RASMUSSEN: Joan Hart. She signed in with you.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Oh. She was just the, um, the cab driver. I needed help and she brought me up here. She left after they treated me, though.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DETECTIVE RASMUSSEN: She, uh, give you any indication where she was headed?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Why? Is there something wrong?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DETECTIVE RASMUSSEN: No. It's nothing for you to worry about.  Come on. Let's go.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 PA VOICE: EKG Tech 3-1-5. EKG Tech 3-1-5.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Sure. Thank you. Why, why are they after you? What, what did you do?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Would you believe me if I said I was innocent?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Yeah. Yeah, I would.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE:  Well, I should go.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Oh, wait. Um, here, take my credit card.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: There's not much of a limit on it but it's something.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: You don't have to do this.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: You didn't have to do what you did either.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Aaron's a great name.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: I don't know why I said it. It's like, I don't know. I knew it or something.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: I think you should keep him.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Well, um, good luck.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 KATE: Yeah, you too.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 CLAIRE: Thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: He swallowed it?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: What's this?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: Tea.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Why would you people want to kill Sayid?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: We believe he has been  mesarete itandarou.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 LENNON: Closest translation is "claimed."
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: Claimed  by what?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: There is a darkness growing in him and once it reaches his heart, everything your friend once was, will be gone.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JACK: No uh. How can you be sure of that?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 DOGEN: Because it happened to your sister.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: Get up!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: That's for my head.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: Now, where's that bitch?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: I don't know. You don't understand. I'm going back to the Temple.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: Yeah, right.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JUSTIN: It looks like he's alone. Maybe we should take him back.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: Or maybe we didn't find him alive.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JUSTIN: Aldo, no. We can't. He's one of them.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO:  He may be one of them.
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO: Hey! Hey!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: Aah! Ugh!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 ALDO:  Where you goin'?
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JUSTIN: Ughh!
Lost.Season06.Episode02 JIN: Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Oh, come on...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: John?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: Are you okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Yeah... I'm fine.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: Come on, let's... let's get you inside.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: Well how long will that take?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: The wedding is in October. Look, I'm just gonna have to call you back. Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: I am so sick of caterers... and bands and... picking fabrics for chair backs. What do you say we just get my parents and your dad and do it shotgun style in Vegas?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: No, you deserve better than that, Helen. We can do this. I know we can.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: I like... this one.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: That one?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: I meant this one.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: You are a very sweet man.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: I know.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: So? How was the conference?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Boring.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: Who's uh... who's Dr. Jack Shephard?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Oh. I met him at lost luggage when I went to fill out the forms. He... he lost something too.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: He's a spinal surgeon?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Yeah. Nice guy. He offered me a free consult.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: You should call him.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Aw, he was just bein' polite, Helen.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: So what? I mean... what are the odds of you just running into a spinal surgeon? I mean, who knows? Maybe it's destiny.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Maybe it is.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Alright, Richard. Time to talk.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RANDY: Welcome back, Colonel. Wow. You got a nice tan in Australia. Did you miss us?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Sure I did, Randy.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RANDY: So? How was the conference, John?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: It was okay. I didn't really learn anything.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RANDY: No?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: But um... I made some good contacts, though.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RANDY: Really? That's interesting. See uh... Ken Fisher called and said you had to cancel your lunch with him.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Right, right... I was a little under the weather that day. Probably jet lag.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RANDY: Really? 'Cause then the seminar people called and said you hadn't picked up your credentials. I did some checking... and it seems you didn't attend a single event. Since we sent you to Sydney on the company's dime... where the hell were you?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Look, Randy... I'm really sorry. Why don't we just call it my vacation week?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RANDY: I thought you wanted that vacation week in October. You know, for your wedding.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Please, Randy... look, I know I shouldn't have lied. But where I was... it's personal. And I... and I really don't want to talk about it.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RANDY: Okay, John. Hey... you're fired.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Thirsty?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Richard, I'm sorry I hit you in the throat and dragged you off the beach but I had to do something.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: What do you want?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: What I've always wanted. For you to come with me.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: Why do you look like John Locke?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: I knew he'd get me access to Jacob. Because John's a candidate. Or at least he was a candidate...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: What do you mean? What do you mean a candidate?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Didn't Jacob tell you any of this?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: Any of what?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Oh, Richard... I'm sorry. You mean, you've been doing everything he told you all this time and he never said why?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: I would never have done that to you. I would never have kept you in the dark.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: And what would you have done?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: I would have treated you with respect. Come with me... and I promise I will tell you everything.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Are you sure about that, Richard? Because people seldom get a second chance...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: I'm not going anywhere with you.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Alright, I'll--
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: I'll be seeing you, Richard. Sooner than you think.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: Am I interrupting?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: Tell me what happened to them.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: Alright. But there's a fairly reasonable chance that you won't believe me...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: Try me.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: John Locke killed them.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: All by himself?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: Yes. He turned into a pillar of black smoke and killed them right before my eyes.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: Did he kill Jacob as well?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: Yes...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: Then where's his body?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: Locke kicked him into the fire and he burned away.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: Locke... do you know why he carried Richard into the jungle?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: He's recruiting.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Hello, James.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: I thought you were dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: I am.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Here's to being dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: You're taking this extremely well.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Taking what extremely well?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: That I'm here.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: I don't give a damn if you're dead. Or time travellin' or... the ghost of Christmas past. All I care about is this whiskey. So bottoms up! Get the hell out of my house.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: This isn't your house, James.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: The hell it ain't...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: No. You just lived here for awhile. This was never your house.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Who are you? 'Cause you sure as hell ain't John Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: What makes you say that?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: 'Cause Locke was scared. Even when he was pretendin' he wasn't. But you? You ain't scared.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: What if I told you I was the person who could answer the most important question in the world?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: And what question is that?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Why are you on this island?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: I'm on this island because my plane crashed. Because my raft blew up. Because the helicopter I was on was ridin' one too heavy.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: That's not why you're here. And if you come with me, I can prove it.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Well, I guess I better put some pants on.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Okay! Okay!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Come on!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: Dude! Dude! What are you doin'?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: What am I doin'? What the hell are you doin'? Did you ever park a car in your life? You're practically in my spot!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: I'm sorry...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Yeah...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: But... you know, there's a handicapped spot right over here.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Yeah? Yeah, okay... but I don't have to park there! I can park anywhere I want! You need to stay inside the lines!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: I'm really sorry. They were supposed to reserve a spot for me, so... you know, I just... parked here.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: I haven't seen you before. Do you work here?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: Actually, I own the company.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: Hugo Reyes.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: John Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: Cool. What do you do here, John?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Actually... nothing. My boss just fired me.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: Oh? Who's your boss?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: His name is Randy. But uh--
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: Randy Nations?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: Yeah... that guy is a huge douche. Want me to talk to him for you?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: No. That's okay...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: Tell you what, John. I own a temp agency too...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: Call this number and tell them that Hugo said to hook you up with a new job, pronto.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HURLEY: And chin up. Things are gonna work out.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LAPIDUS: He's gettin' pretty ripe!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: Where is everybody?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SUN: They left. They said they were going to the temple.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: Right now, that's the safest place on the island. We should go there too.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SUN: Are you alright?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: I'm fine. Come on, let's get out of here!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SUN: What makes you think that I'm going with you?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: Because... you want to find Jin.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SUN: What do you know about my husband?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: I know that if he's on the island... and if he's alive... then he'll be at the temple. Let's get moving!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SUN: What about John? We need to bury him.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: What were you doing alone in that house, James?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Drinkin'.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Where are the rest of your friends?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Some temple somewhere...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Why aren't you with 'em?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: You know what? How 'bout we just don't talk?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: You got it.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Who the hell's that?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: You can see him?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: The kid? Hell yeah I can see him.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Hey!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BOY: You know the rules. You can't kill him.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Don't tell me what I can't do...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Don't tell me what I can't do!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Locke! Locke! Look, whoever you are, you got about twenty seconds and then I'm outta here!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: Where is he?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: What the hell are you doin' here?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: Where is he?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Locke? He ran off into the jungle after some kid.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: We need to go! Now!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Go where?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: To the temple! Let's go! Let's go!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: You know what? I've been to the temple and I think I'm stickin' with Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: That man is not John Locke!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: I know.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: Then why are you with him?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Because he's got answers. He says he knows why I'm on this island. Unless you wanna tell me why I'm here, Richard...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: Don't be naive! He's not gonna tell you anthing, he's gonna kill you!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: If he wanted to kill me he could have done it a dozen times already...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 RICHARD: You don't understand what you're dealing with! He doesn't just want you dead, he wants everyone dead! Everyone you care about! All of 'em! And he won't stop--
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Who were you talking to?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Nobody. You ever catch up to the kid?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: What kid?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Right... let's get on with it, shall we?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Yes, James. Let's get on with it.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 WOMAN: What kind of animal would you describe yourself as?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 WOMAN: What kind of animal would you describe yourself as?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: What uh... I don't know what that has to do with--
Lost.Season06.Episode03 WOMAN: Just say whatever comes to mind.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 WOMAN: Would you describe yourself as a people person?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: May I speak to your supervisor?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 WOMAN: Of course. I'll go get her.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ROSE: Good morning, mister... Locke?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ROSE: I'm Rose Nadler, the office supervisor. What can I do for you?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Uh... what you can do, Mrs. Nadler, is spare me the questions about what kind of animal I am and hopefully place me in a job.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ROSE: Absolutely. What kind of placement are you looking for?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Well, I see here that you have a listing for a site coordinator...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ROSE: Construction site coordinator. Uh... I'm not sure that's a good match.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Well, if experience is the issue, I have--
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ROSE: Experience isn't the issue.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Look... Mr. Reyes told me if I came down here I would be taken care of.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ROSE: And Mr. Reyes is my boss, so if he said that, I can make it happen for you. If you want to work construction, you got it.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ROSE: I'm not finished. I will send you down there tomorrow and then, the day after, you will be back in my office. Look, Mr. Locke... let's try to be a little more realistic.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: And what do you know about realistic?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ROSE: I have cancer. Terminal cancer.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: I'm sorry...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ROSE: When the doctors first told me, I had a hard time accepting it. But eventually... I got past the denial part. And I got back to living whatever life I've got left. So, how about we find you a job you can do?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Do you read?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Books. Do you read books?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Sure. Who doesn't?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: My favorite's Steinbeck. Of Mice and Men. You know that one?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Nope. A little after my time...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: It's about these two guys, George and Lennie. Lennie's kinda slow... causin' George problems... so George walks him into the woods and tells him to look out yonder and picture the pretty little house they're gonna live in some day. Then he shoots Lennie in the back of the head.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Well that doesn't sound like a happy ending.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: It ain't.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: What's on your mind, James?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: I'm wonderin' what would happen to you if I put a bullet in your head.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Why don't we find out?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: What are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: What I am is trapped. And I've been trapped for so long that I don't even remember what it feels like to be free. Maybe you can understand that. But before I was trapped, I was a man, James. Just like you.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: I'm havin' a hard time believin' that...
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: You can believe whatever you want, that's the truth. I know what it's like to feel joy... to feel pain, anger, fear... to experience betrayal. I know what it's like to lose someone you love. So if you wanna shoot me, shoot me. But you're so close, James. It would be such a shame to turn back now.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: Why did you have to bring him to the statue in the first place?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: Because the people there need to see the face of what they're up against.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: And whats to stop what they're up against from changing his face?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: He can't; not anymore. Hes stuck this way.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: Does anyone want to say anything?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 ILANA: Didn't any of you know him?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: Alright, I knew him. John Locke was a...a believer, he was a man of faith, he was... a much better man than I will ever be.  And I'm very sorry I murdered him.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LAPIDUS: Weirdest damn funeral I've ever been to.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 WOMEN: Hello, Dr. Shephard's office?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 WOMAN: Hello? Can I help you?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: No, no you can't.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: Who was that on the phone?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: No one.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: No one? John, I just heard you talking on the phone.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: I was uh, I was calling Dr. Shephard.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: Good for you. When are you going to see him?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: I'm not going to see him.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: Well, uh, I don't understand, why wouldn't you-
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: I got fired, Helen.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: Coming!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 MAN:  Ma'am, Oceanic courier. Delivering your lost luggage. Sign here to accept the delivery.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: Thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 MAN: Okay, thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: Okay, John. Talk to me. How did you get fired?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: I lied to Randy, I didn't go to the conferences in Sydney.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Open the case, Helen.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: What are these for?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: My walkabout.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: Your, your what?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: My walkabout. An adventure in the outback. Man against nature. But they wouldn't let me go. And I sat there yelling at them. Shouting at them that they couldn't tell me what I can't do. But they were right. I'm sick of imagining of what my life could be out of this chair, Helen. What it would be like to walk down the isle with you because its not gonna happen. So if you need me to see more doctors, have more consults, if you need me to get out of this chair, I don't blame you. But I don't want you to spend your life waiting for a miracle because there is no such thing.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 HELEN: There are miracles, John. And the only thing I was ever waiting for was you.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Nice view. Now what?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Now we go down.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Down where?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Down there.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: No offense, but you already died. So this is great that this isn't a big deal for you. But if you think I'm climbing down there first, your off your damn mind.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: It's no problem, I'll go first.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Coming, James?!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: James!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Locke!
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Hold on, come on. Come on, I got you, come on. Come on. Come on.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: What is this place?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: What the hell's that all about?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Inside joke.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: So this is what you wanted me to see? A hole in the cliff; with some rocks on a scale; that's why I'm here?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: That's why you're here.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: That, James, is why you're all here.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Alright, speed it up, all the way. No cheating, come on now. Come on, all the way, you can catch up. Bring it in, bring it in, all the way. Good job. Good job.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Alright, everyone, please open your textbooks to chapter four. Today, we are going to talk about... the Human reproductive system.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Do you know where the- Excuse me, can you tell me where the teacher's lounge is?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 KID: Yeah, its over there.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 MAN: Alright, I know I sound like a broken record, but how many times do we have to go over this? If you have the last cup of coffee, you remove the filter and throw it away. Fear not. I will make a fresh pot.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: Actually, I was just hoping for some Earl Grey.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: Tea? Now there's a gentleman drink. I don't believe we met.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: Ben Linus, European History.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 JOHN: John Locke, Substitute.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 BEN: Well, welcome.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Who wrote all this?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: His name was Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Was Jacob?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: He died yesterday.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: You don't seem to upset about it?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: I'm not.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Why are all the names crossed out?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: There not all crossed out.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: "Shephard". That Jack Shephard?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: He's not the only one.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Reyes. That's Hugo, right?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: What's the eight about?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Jacob had a thing for numbers. Sixteen, Jarrah.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Forty-Two, Kwon; I don't know if it's Sun or if it's Jin.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Here, four, Locke. I think we both know him.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Last but not least, number 15, Ford.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: That would be you.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Why would he write my name on this wall? I never even met the guy.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Oh no, I'm sure you did meet Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: At some point in your life, James, probably when you were young and miserable and vulnerable. He came to you, he manipulated you, pulled your strings like you were a puppet. And as a result, choices you thought were made, were never really choices at all. He was pushing you, James. Pushing you... to the Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Why the hell would he do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Because, you're a candidate.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Candidate for what?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: He thought he was the protector of this place. And you, James, have been nominated to take that job.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: And what does that mean?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: It means you have three choices. First, you can do nothing and see how all this plays out. And possibly, your name will get crossed out.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Second option. You can accept the job. Become the new Jacob. And protect the Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Protect it from what?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: From nothing, James. That's the joke, there is nothing to protect it from, its just a damn Island. And it will be perfectly fine without Jacob or you, or any of the other people; whose lives he wasted.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: You said there were three choices?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: The third choice, James, is that we just go. We just get the hell off this Island. We never look back.
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: How do we do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 LOCKE: Together. So what do you say, James? Are you ready to go home?
Lost.Season06.Episode03 SAWYER: Hell yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Hey mom.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MRS SHEPARD: Have they found him yet?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: No, I... I called a couple of hours ago, and they think the coffin was checked through Berlin.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MRS SHEPARD: How do you lose a body?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I don't know mom, but there's nothing we can do except for wait for more information.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MRS SHEPARD: I don't want to wait Jack, how am I supposed to get anything done. I can't even find his will.  Papers everywhere!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Look mom, I'll come over in a couple of hours an we'll find it together, okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MRS SHEPARD: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Good. Now, mom, when did I have my appendix taken out?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MRS SHEPARD: You were seven, or eight, maybe. You collapsed at school. Your father wanted to do the procedure himself, but they wouldn't let him. You don't remember that?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Yeah, I... I guess I do.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Oh, dammit. Mom, I gotta go.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MRS SHEPARD: Well don't forget to call--
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Hey. Sorry I'm late. Thought I had enough time to go home and change after work.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID: Don't worry about it.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Sorry David, okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID:  Okay, Dad.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DOGEN: I was afraid you'd left.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Is leaving an option?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DOGEN: Everything is an option. But I would have to stop you.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Well...I appreciate your honesty.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DOGEN: Your friends - Ford and Austen and Kwon - they are not coming back, are they?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: No, probably not.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DOGEN: I appreciate your honesty. 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Tie again, Dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MILES: Shocker.  That's it for me.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Hungry?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MILES: Are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: I could eat.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Hey man, you know if there's like a kitchen in this place?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MAN:  It's all the way down the hallway, Hugo.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, what are you doing here ?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: I'm here because I need you.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: For what?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: You should probably get a pen, you're going to have to write a few things down.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: What kind of things?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: Someone's coming to the island. I need you to help them find it.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Hooked up the cable in here, so you can watch the Red Sox if you want.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID: Thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: You reading this?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I used to read this to you when you were little. You always wanted to hear about Kitty and Snowdrop, they were Alice's...
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Hey. Hey! David. 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: What are you listening to?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID: You haven't heard of them.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I'm just trying to have a conversation with you David.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID: Why? We see each other like once a month. Can't we just... get through it.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Yeah mom?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: Where are you? I thought you were coming over?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I'm sorry. I'm heading out right now. I'll be right there. 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I have to go over to your grandmother's house, you wanna come?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID: No thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: All right well, I'll be back in about an hour, then we'll eat, OK?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID: Great.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 SAYID: Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 SAYID: Why are they all staring at me? 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Just ignore them.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 SAYID: Look, you told me these people think I have an infection, that they wanted to give me some mysterious pill that you instructed me not to take. And then you disappeared. What are you hiding from me?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK:  The pill was poison. They wanted me to kill you. Whatever it is they think happened to you Sayid, they say it happened to someone else too.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 SAYID: Who?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Claire!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: I'm gonna get you out of there.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: How long have you been out here?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Since you all left. How long ago was that?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Three years.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: I can get you somewhere safe. Come on - think you can walk?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: I don't know.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DOGEN: What are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Nothing. I'm just you know...looking...because I'm a fan of ...temples and like history...Indiana Jones stuff.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DOGEN: You shouldn't be here. Go back to the courtyard.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: Tell him you can do what you want. Tell him you're a candidate.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: I'm a candidate and I can do what I want.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DOGEN: Who told you that? 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Doesn't matter. Why don't you go back to the courtyard ?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DOGEN:  Ore ga omae wo mamoraneba narannowa,un ga yokattana  Denakereba sonokubi wo haneteta 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: What'd he say?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: You don't want to know. What are you doing here Hugo?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Going through the secret passageway like you told me.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: I told you to bring Jack with you.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: You ever tried to get Jack to do something? It's like impossible. I can just go myself.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: You have to bring him with you Hugo.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: OK it's bad enough you already made me write down way too much stuff, and I just lied to a Samurai. Look, if you've any idea of how to get Jack to go on your little adventure, I'm listening dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Be cool man. Act natural.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, keep your voice down. I'm gonna get up and go. Wait ten seconds and then follow me.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Follow you where?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: I found a secret tunnel that leads out to the jungle.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: You found a secret tunnel?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Well, Jacob told me about it. Said you and me have to go.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I'm not going anywhere, Hurley.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: I told him you'd say that, so he told me to tell you "You have what it takes."
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: What'd you just say?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: He said you have what it takes, he said you'd know what that meant.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Where is he?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Jacob. Where is he?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: He's kind of dead. Turns up whenever he wants, like Obi-Wan Kenobi. But...if you wanna talk to him, he's where we're going, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Well then let's go see Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE:  Get in there!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE:  So, look what I found! One of the men who tried to kill you! He was just pretending to be dead but he wasn't. Now we get to talk to him!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN: You wanna talk to me about what?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE:  About where you're hiding my son.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE:  We'd better get that cleaned up. If there's one thing that'll kill you around here it's infection.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE:  I'll be right back, don't move, okay? 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Have you been out here all this time...by yourself?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Oh, no, no, I'm not by myself.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN: Look, we've gotta get out of here now.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: It's okay. I know her.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN: No. I know her. Do you have any idea what she's gonna do to us...if we don't get outta here now?! She's gonna kill us both!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Which way?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY:  It's this way.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Whoa! Hey, it's me!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 KATE:  Jack!  I almost shot you!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK:  I noticed! What are you doing out here? Where...where's Jin and Sawyer?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 KATE: Jin went back to the Temple, and... Sawyer's on his own.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Hey, Kate. There's a secret door to get back into the Temple on the north wall by the big tree...
Lost.Season06.Episode04 KATE: Yeah, I'm not going back to the Temple.  I'm going to find Claire.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Kate...
Lost.Season06.Episode04 KATE: I'm going back to the beach camp. She might still be there, Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Kate, she's not at the beach... The people at the Temple said that something happened to her.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 KATE: Do they know where she is?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I don't know, they didn't say.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 KATE:  I have to...I have to find her.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Kate...wait...wait! Come with us and then we'll all go back to the Temple together.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY:  Dude!  Jacob said just you and me...she's kinda not invited.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Well, I'm inviting her.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 KATE: Jack, it's okay. Just go.  It's alright. I hope you find what you're looking for. .
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: We're never going to find it.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Take it easy, Mom. It's somewhere in here, and we'll find it.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: It's like a needle in a damned haystack. Why your father wouldn't just give his will to his lawyer is beyond me.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK:  Well, why would he make it easy on us now?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: You want a drink? 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Uh...no, no, no thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: Good for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: How's David holding up?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK:  What?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: He was really upset at the funeral.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: He was?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: He didn't tell you?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: No...no, he didn't.  Communication is not one of his strong suits.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: Well, it runs in the family. When you were David's age your father was lucky if he could get more than one word out of you at a time.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: That's because I was terrified of him, Mom.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: How do you know David isn't terrified of you?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK:  Why would he be?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: I don't know, Jack. Maybe you should ask him.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: Found it. Last will and testament.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: Jack?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Yeah?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 MARGO: Did your father ever mention a Claire Littleton?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN:  Psst! Hey! Untie me before she comes back in!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Why would I do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN: Are you not listening to me? She's gonna kill us both! Loosen my ropes, and when she comes back in, I'll snap her neck.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE:  So, I'm...really sorry you got stuck in my trap. Gonna get you all cleaned up, now, okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: It's alright, you're doing good. Well. at least you don't have to stitch yourself up. . I had to do that once. They shot me right here .
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: You've been living here since we left? 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Not always here. I had to, um, move around quite a lot. To hide from them.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Lucky I'm still alive.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: What are you going to do with him?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: He's gonna tell me where they've got my baby. Where they...where they've got Aaron.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN: We don't have your kid!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: You're lying, okay, I know you have him.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN: You're crazy! We never took your...
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Shut up.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Claire, how do you know they took him? How can you be so sure?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: How can I be so sure? Well, first my father told me, and then my friend told me, so I'm pretty damn sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Your friend? Who's your friend?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE:  My friend.  You're still my friend, aren't you, Jin?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Yes, yes, of course.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Good. I'm glad.  All done. Good as new.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Okay. So.  Now it's your turn.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Sorry, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: For what?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: You know, what happened back there. Wrecking your game with Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Don't worry about it. There's nothing left to wreck.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Yeah? What happened to you guys? I thought you were gonna get married and have like a dozen kids.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Guess I wasn't cut out for it.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Really? I think you'd make a great dad.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I'd make a terrible dad.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: What is that?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Asthma inhaler.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, it's Shannon's.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK:  We're at the caves.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY:  The caves we used to live in?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: I totally forgot these were in here, man.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Wait a sec. What if we time-travelled again? To, like, dinosaur times? And then we died and then we got buried here?  What if these skeletons are us?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: What's that?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Did I tell you how I found this place?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: You were looking for water, right?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: No. I was chasing the ghost of my dead father.  He led me here.  That was his coffin. Before I smashed it to pieces.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Why'd you do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Because he wasn't in it.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: David? I got us pizza!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Hey, dinner's...
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID:  This is David. Leave a message. 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: David, i-it's me again. Listen...uh....if I did something to upset you I am really, really sorry.  I'm gonna drive over to your mother's house, I know that she's out of town, so if you are there, just...just don't go anywhere, okay?  What...whatever I did, I'm sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: David?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGE: "Ahhh yes this message is for David Shepard. Hi David this is Dr. Summerland from the Williams Conservatory, just calling to confirm you slot next Friday the 24th at 7 pm. We look forward to seeing you, and good luck." 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGE:  Hey David, it's dad. I'm uh..., I'm in Sydney, Australia. Something...something happened...and I... I just needed to hear your voice. Ummm...I guess I'll try again later. I love you.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: This is cool, dude. Very old school.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: You know, you and me trekking through the jungle, on our way to do something that we don't quite understand. Good times. You mind if I ask you something?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Why'd you come back, you know, to the island?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Why'd you come back?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Back in L.A., Jacob hopped into the back of my cab, and told me I was supposed to, so I came.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: What? If you have a good reason for coming back, let's hear it man.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I came back here because I was broken. And I was stupid enough to think this place could fix me.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, I'm sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: How much further we got, Hurley?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: It's not far. It's not far at all.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: It's right there. It's a lighthouse.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I don't understand. How is it that we've never seen it before?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Guess we weren't lookin for it.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Tell me where my son is.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN: I don't know where your son is.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Stop covering for them. They're not going to help you anymore. All you gotta do is just tell me the truth.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN: I am telling you the truth. We don't have your kid. We never had your kid.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Stop lying to me! Your people took me to the temple and tortured me.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN: No, we captured you because you were out here in the jungle picking our people off.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Claire wait! Hold on.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Hold on? Jin, they stuck me with needles. They branded me.  And if I hadn't been able to escape from the temple, they would have killed me.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN: No, you're not remembering things right.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Look shut up, okay? You've got one more chance. One more chance - just tell me where my son is.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN: I don't know where your damn kid is.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Kate! Kate took him! Kate took Aaron. She took him with her when she left the island.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: What do you mean she took him?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: He's been with her, with Kate, for the past three years. Aaron is three.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JUSTIN: He's telling you the truth. We had nothing to do with this. So if you just untie me, I'll leave, and I promise I will never tell anyone I ever even saw you. Just untie me.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Pretty cool, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Jacob's in here?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: I guess so. First we gotta go upstairs and turn this thing on. 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Does it say anything on your arm about the door being jammed?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: After you. 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 UNKNOWN BOY : Is that your son?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 UNKNOWN BOY: He's really good.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DOGEN: Itsumo doori yareba daijoubu da  Yoshi itte koi! 
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DOGEN: They are too young to have this kind of pressure, aren't they?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Yes. Yes they are.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DOGEN: It's hard to watch and be unable to help. Your son has a gift. How long has he been playing?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I... I don't know.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Whoa! Dude this is cool. Must've built this to help ships get here and stuff. I guess they used the mirror because electricity hadn't been invented yet.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Where's Jacob?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Ahh he's not here yet. Lets get started.  Tell me when it gets to 108 degrees.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Stop!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Did you see that?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Did I see what?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: The mirror. I saw something in the mirror.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: It's just ocean dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: These are our names.  Turn it to 23 degrees.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: I...I don't think Jacob wants
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: What. What is that?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: It's my house. It's the house I grew up in.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Oh. That's weird.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Haven't lived in that house since I was a kid. He's been watching. The whole time. All of us. He's been watching us. Hurley, where's Jacob?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: I don't know.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: You said that he'd be here.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Well I was just...kind of...assuming.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Hurley, I wanna know why he was watching me. I wanna know. So you're going to ask him right now.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: It doesn't work like that, I told you. He just kind of shows up whenever he feels like it.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Why was he watching?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: I don't know.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Why is my name written down on this thing?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: He didn't tell me.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: What does he want from me?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Aren't we supposed--
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: What does he want from me?!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY : I don't know, Jack!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: You were great in there.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID: You...saw me?  I missed a couple of notes.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Sounded perfect from where I was standing.  David you scared the hell outta me.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID: You were at grandmas. I thought I could get back to your place before I got home.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I didn't know you were still playing.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID: I made mom promise not to tell you.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID: It was always such a big deal to you. You used to sit and watch me practice. You were so...into it. I didn't tell you I was coming here because...I didn't want you to see me fail.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: You know when I was your age, my father didn't want to see me fail either. He used to say to me that...he said that I didn't have what it takes. I spent my whole life carrying that around with me. I don't ever want you to feel that way. I will always love you, no matter what you do. In my eyes you can never fail. I just wanna be a part of your life.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID:  Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: I've got some pizza back at the house. You hungry?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 DAVID: Sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACK: Good. Let's go home.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: How'd it go?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Where were you, man?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: Doesn't matter, he wouldn't have been able to see me anyway.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Yeah, well if you'd told me that and I'd like, explained everything, then maybe Jack wouldn't have freaked out and smashed your mirror into a billion pieces. Thanks for the seven years of bad luck, by the way.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: You've got ink on your forehead.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: I have ink on my forehead? That's all you have to say? Jack broke your lighthouse, dude. Mission un-accomplished. Whoever you said we need to help get to the island is totally screwed.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB:  Well I'm sure they'll find some other way.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: So...everything you wanted me to do didn't get done, and you don't even care?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Wait a minute. Did you want Jack to see what was in that mirror?  Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: It was the only way for him to understand how important he is.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: That was your plan? I think it backfired, man.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: Jack is here because he has to do something. He can't be told what that is. He's got to find it himself. Sometimes you can just...hop in the back of someone's cab and tell them what they're supposed to do. Other times...you have to let them look out at the ocean for a while.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Well next time how about you tell me everything up front. I'm not big on secret plans OK.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: I couldn't risk you not coming, Hugo. I had to get you and Jack as far away from that Temple as I possibly could.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: What? Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: Because someone's coming there. Someone bad.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 HURLEY: Dude, we gotta warn them!
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JACOB: You can't warn them Hugo. I'm sorry, it's too late.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Look, if I didn't kill him, he would've killed me. Glad you didn't untie him.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Claire, please, whatever you're thinking.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Why'd you say that Kate was raising Aaron?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN:  I was lying.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: Because I wanted to save his life. But you were right. The others have your baby. Aaron is at the temple, I know because I saw him there. But you'll need me to get to him.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: How do we get in?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: There's a secret way. No-one will see us.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: Thank you Jin, thank you. And I'm so glad to know you were lying because...if what you said was the truth, if Kate was raising Aaron...I'd kill her.
Lost.Season06.Episode04 LOCKE: Am I interrupting?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 JIN: John?
Lost.Season06.Episode04 CLAIRE: That's not John. This is my friend.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CABBIE: The meter doesn't stop until you get out, pal.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Keep the change.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Hello, Nadia.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 EVA: You're here!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAM: Where were you, Uncle Sayid?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I was in Sydney.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 EVA: Where's Sydney?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: In Australia.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: You bring flowers for my wife?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I'll give them to you if you want.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: It's good to see you, Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Good to see you too, brother.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: Come.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 EVA: Uncle Sayid, what did you bring us from Australia?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Go look in my bag. It's on the couch.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: It's good you came, Sayid. They've missed you.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: We're lucky he even showed up! The world traveler off on his exotic business trips...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Translating contracts for an oil company is hardly exotic. And it's painfully dull.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: There's, uh... little adventure in the world of dry cleaning.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: He's being modest. Omer's just opened up a new store.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Congratulations.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: I thought we talked about cell phones at the dinner table...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: Dinner is over. This is business.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: Yes?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: Did you get my letters?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: You never wrote back.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAM: These are awesome! Thanks!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: You're welcome.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 EVA: Mommy, we found a picture of you in Uncle Sayid's bag.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 Eva hands the picture to Nadia, Omer watches from outside the room.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I want to talk to you. I want some answers.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: Answers to what?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Let's start with that machine. You hooked me up to this thing, you stuck needles in me, and you called it a test.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: For every man there is a scale. On one side of the scale there is good. On the other side, evil. This machine tells us how the scale is balanced. And yours tipped the wrong way.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: And that's why you tried to poison me?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: Yes. I think it would be best if you were dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: You think you know me, but you don't. I'm a good man. So if you're trying to kill me…
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: Go. Leave this place. Never come back.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: Are you ready?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: Why does it have to be me? I mean, you could send Sawyer or Jin or... do it yourself...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: If I could do it myself I wouldn't be asking you, Claire.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: If I go in there, I need to know you'll do what you said. I want my son back.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: I always do what I say.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: Are you gonna hurt them?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: Only the ones who won't listen.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: It's me! Calm down!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: What are you doing? It's two-thirty in the morning!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: Sayid...I'm in trouble.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: What kind of trouble?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: I borrowed money to open the second store. But...I didn't borrow it from a bank. I paid the loan back, but the man who lent me this money, he says I still owe him interest every month. For as long as I own my business.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: If you need money I'll lend it to you.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: I don't need money, Sayid! I need you to convince these people to leave me alone.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Convince them?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: Sayid, don't forget who you're talking to. I know what you did in the war. You were an interrogator for the Republican Guard. I know what kind of man you are.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: If you think I'm going to hurt someone just because you made a bad business decision…
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMER: No, this is not about me! Our life savings... it's all gone, Sayid... all of it! We could lose our home! Please! Look... I know you care about Nadia. If you care about us... about her... you will do this, Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I'm sorry. I'm not that man anymore.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: What are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I'm leaving. I've been banished.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Banished? For what?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Apparently I'm evil. These people say I'm better off dead. Which is surprising, considering they were the ones who saved my life.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Well, actually, they're not. They...they tried to save you, but...you were dead man. For two hours. Trust me when…when you sat up they were just as surprised as the rest of us. So whatever brought you back, it wasn't them.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 RANDOM-OTHER: Hold it...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Stop! Don't shoot her. What are you doing here?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: He wants to see you.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: Nanno kotodaka wakaran
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: Speak English.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: Who wants to see me?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: You know who.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: If he wants to see me, then tell him to come in.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: No, he wants you to go to him. He's waiting outside beyond the outer wall.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: I'm not a fool. If I step outside this temple, he'll kill me.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: Well, then maybe you should send someone he won't kill.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: Stop her!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: Kono kettyaku ga tsukumade onna wo anagura ni hourikonde oke.  Soshite suguni Shephard to Reyes wo heyani tsurete koi. [そしてすぐにシェパードとレイエスを部屋に連れてこい―Then 
bring Shephard and Reyes to my room immediately.]
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Uh, that's gonna be a little difficult. We can't find them.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: Shikkari sagase! 
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Come on!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: Come with me.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I thought you wanted me to leave.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: Things have changed.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: Your friends, Shephard and Reyes. Do you know where they went?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: No I don't.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Why is Claire here? And what was she talking about?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: She's a confused girl, under the influence of an angry man.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: What man?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: For years, he has been trapped, but now Jacob is gone, he's free. This man will not stop until he has destroyed every living thing on this island. He is evil incarnate.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: And you want me to speak to him?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: No. I want you to kill him. He will come to you as someone you know, someone who has died. As soon as you see him...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: ...plunge this deep into his chest. If you allow him to speak, it is already too late.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Since I've been here, I've been drowned, beaten, and tortured...at your hands. Why would I ever do anything for you?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: You said that there is still good in your soul...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: ...then prove it.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAM: How long are you staying Uncle Sayid?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Just a few more days. I have to go to Toronto, to work.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAM: We like it when you're here.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 EVA: Yeah, and mommy likes it too.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Ok, be good.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: Sayid!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: Omer! What happened, is he going to be alright?!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOCTOR: Taking him into surgery now, he suffered a punctured lung and some internal bleeding.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Do you know how this happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOCTOR: EMTs think he was mugged. I'll come get you as soon as he's stable.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: Sayid! Where are you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Stay here with Omer.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: This wasn't a mugging, was it? Whatever you're thinking of doing, don't do it. I don't want you to, please. Just, go home? Wait for the kids. Make them feel safe Sayid. Will you do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 On-Island - Sayid is trekking through the jungle and hears a voice approaching him.]
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Hello? Sayid?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Hello Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Are you leaving?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I'm not exactly sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: What'd I miss?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Ask Miles.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Wow.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: It's good to see you too Miles.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Sawyer sent you packing huh? I thought about going after him too. But, um, I knew he'd just end up berating me until I turned around and came back. That pretty much what happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Pretty much.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Well, welcome back to the circus.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: What's going on in here?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Well, let's see, oh...that Australian chick's back.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Wait, what?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: You know the...the blonde? One that had the baby?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Right. Claire. She just strolled in here a couple hours ago, acting all weird. Still 
hot though.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Miles, where is she?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Where is she!?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: Hello Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: Now why'd you go and do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: You want it back? Take it, I won't bite.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: What are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: Well Sayid you seem to have some idea about that considering that you stabbed me in the chest without even saying hello. What'd they tell you?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: They said that you were evil incarnate.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: Feel sorry for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: Dogen...the man who sent you out here, knew that you had no chance of killing me, and he believed that I would kill you if you tried. And this wasn't the first time that he tried to get someone else to do it for him was it?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: Then shame on you, for being talked into it so easily.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: And what is it you are trying to talk me into?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: Sorry?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: You haven't killed me, clearly there's something you want.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: I just want you to deliver a message, that's all.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Then why didn't you just have Claire deliver it?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: Because it would mean a lot more coming from you. Sayid, if you'll do this for me... what if I told you that you could have anything you wanted. What if I said you can have anything in the entire world?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I would tell you that the only thing I ever wanted, died in my arms, and I'll never see it again.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LOCKE: What if you could?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Ah, we had an unfortunate incident, involving a boomerang. My apologies.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: What time did the kids go to bed?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: About two hours ago.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: And what did you tell them?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: That daddy had an accident, but that he's going to be fine.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: He is still recovering from surgery but, he's awake now. Did he tell you about the loan?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Look, I have money.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: No, this is Omer's responsibility, he brought this on himself.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 NADIA: Why didn't you want to be with me? You carry my picture around with you, Sayid. If you care about me, why did you push me toward your brother?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: For the last twelve years I've been trying to wash my hands of all the horrible things I've done. I can't be with you, because I don't deserve you.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: There is a man in the jungle... about a mile south of us by the outer wall. He sent me back here to give you a message. He wants you to know that Jacob is dead. And because he's gone, none of you have to stay here anymore. You're free.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: The man that I met is leaving the island forever. And those of you who want to go with him, should leave the temple and join him. You have until sundown to decide.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CINDY: What happens at sundown if we stay?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: You die.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Hey! When did you get back? Are Ford and Kwon with you?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Where is Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Okay, I need you to tell me what I need to know before I...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: I said where is Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Alright... you just let go of me, okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: You have two minutes.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Claire, it's me.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: Kate?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Are you okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: I... I can't believe you're here. Did they capture you too?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: No. No, they...why did they put you down here? What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: They have my son, Kate. They have Aaron. They took him from me.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: No. No, Claire. They don't have Aaron. I took him.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: I took him off the island. You were gone and we couldn't find you so... I raised him. And he is the most beautiful, amazing little boy. But I came back here to rescue you so that you could be with him. So that you guys could be together again.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: I'm not the one that needs to be rescued, Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Time's up, let's go.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: No! No, wait! No! Wait, wait!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: You wanted to see her, so let's go!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: He's coming, Kate! He's coming and they can't stop him!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Everybody calm down! It's gonna be okay! No, no! Wait! Hang on!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Hey! Hey, you created a panic here! Our people are leaving!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I was asked to deliver a message. And that's what I did. What your people do now is up to them.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Cindy, wait. You're all safe here. As long as we stay in the Temple, he can't touch us.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CINDY: You heard him. Jacob's dead. And if it isn't safe here anymore, we can't take that risk.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Everyone listen! This is a bluff! He can't come in! He can't come in!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Hey, what happened out there? One minute you're banished, the next you're telling everyone they're gonna die...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: That's the sum of it.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: So... are we getting out of here or what?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Not yet.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I have to return this.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMAR: Going to pick up the kids?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMAR: Why don't you get in the car?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMAR: Get in, Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMAR: Unless you want us to pick up the kids together?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 OMAR: Why don't you have a seat?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: Hey, you want some eggs? I can, uh... make whatever you want. Fried, scrambled, uh...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: We still got that poacher? Where's the poacher?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: Want poached? 'Cause I can make you some good poached eggs.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: No. Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: I make good eggs... no? Alright.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: Martin Keamy.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Sayid Jarrah. But you already know that.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: Ah, that I do. Yeah. Alright...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 Keamy sits down across from Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: So, Sayid... how's your brother doin'?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: His brother got mugged right out front of his own store. It's just... terrible. But 
at least this way, you know, he's still around to take care of his family. You do want to take care of his family, don't you?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: Yes? You know, I can see that you're a very direct guy Sayid, so I'm just gonna get to the point. Your brother, he borrowed money from me. And just like anybody who borrows money or has a loan to pay, he has to make payments.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: My brother told me he's paid you everything he owes. And that you still want more.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: Sayid, that's a lie. Your brother does owe me, and somebody is gonna pay me that money.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Did you put my brother in the hospital?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: What, you think it was me? I didn't do that. You know, it's a dangerous world, Sayid. And you know that because you're from Iraq. You never know when somebody's just gonna sneak up…
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... alright... okay. Just relax now.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Shut up!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: Okay, fine. Fine. Okay? It's done. Alright? Your brother doesn't owe me anything. The debt's forgiven. Alright?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KEAMY: Good? Okay? Just relax and... forget about it.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I can't.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 [Sayid shoots Keamy. Banging is heard coming from a large freezer, Sayid finds a beaten Jin tied up inside. Sayid 
removes the tape from Jin's mouth and Jin speaks in Korean.]
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 JIN: No English!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: You let him talk to you...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I stabbed him in the chest like you told me to. Then I let him talk to me.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: That's twice you've tried to have someone else kill me. You had the opportunity to do it yourself. Why didn't you?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: I was a business man once. In Osaka. I worked at a bank. I was good at my job. Very successful. And one Friday, I was promoted. My associates took me out to celebrate. I had too much to drink. Every Friday I picked my son up from baseball. He was twelve. The accident was very bad. I survived. But my son...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: And then, in the hospital, a man came to me. A man I had never met. And he told me that he could save my son's life, but I would have to come here... to this island... where I would have a new job. And I could never see my boy again.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Who was this man?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: His name was Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Jacob drives a hard bargain.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: The man outside... I take it he offered you a similar bargain?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 DOGEN: It is sundown. Will you choose to stay or go?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I'd like to stay.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Oh my God... what have you done?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LENNON: Do you realize what you just did? He was the only thing keeping it out! Idiot! You 
just let it in!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: I know.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: We gotta go now.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Run! Run! Run!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: This way!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: This way! This way!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: I have to go get Claire!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 ILANA: Where are Shephard and Reyes? And Ford?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Who the hell are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 ILANA: Just answer the question!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: They're gone, everyone's gone. I'm the only one left. Kate and I got separated.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Lapidus? How did you...
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LAPIDUS: We'll play catch up later. You wanna live, you better move your ass!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 ILANA: What about Jarrah? Is he here?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Yeah, he was headed to the pool room.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 BEN: I'll go get him.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 ILANA: Linus, wait! Alright... the rest of you with me, come on!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: Claire, come on! Claire, we gotta go, you gotta get out of there!
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 KATE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 CLAIRE: We'll be much safer here.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 [Ben arrives at the spring and find Sayid holding the bloody dagger, watching over the 
corpses of Dogen and Lennon.]
Lost.Season06.Episode05 BEN: Sayid? Come on. I know a way out of here. There's still time.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SAYID: Not for me.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Where's your husband?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SUN: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Your husband. He took off yesterday.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 SUN: Jin was here? He's alive?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 MILES: Last I saw of him, yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 LAPIDUS: You do hear that, right? You got a plan or are you gonna keep staring at the wall?
Lost.Season06.Episode05 ILANA: Yes, I have a plan.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 ILANA: Everybody inside, now.
Lost.Season06.Episode05 [Kate, Claire, and Sayid walk through the courtyard, which is littered with mangled corpses. 
Outside, they meet up with Locke, who has assembled a small group of Temple dwellers. They 
follow him into the darkness of the jungle.]
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Where's Jarrah?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I'm fine. Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Where is he?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Considering that he just killed Dogen, I don't think he's going to be joining us.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 SUN: Who's Dogen?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: The guy in charge at the Temple.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Sayid killed the interpreter too.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Are you sure?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: He was standing over their dead bodies holding a bloody dagger, so yeah, I'm pretty sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 SUN: You said we would be safe at the Temple!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: That's what I was told...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Well, what about the beach?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: What beach?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Where we buried Locke. Where they lived. At least we'll have the water at our backs and it's familiar territory. Anybody else got a better idea?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: No. The beach it is.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 SUN: That way!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Move.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: It was on this island that everything changed. That everything finally became clear. Elba... is where Napoleon faced his greatest test. Because exile wasn't the worst of his fate. What was truly devastating to him was the loss of his power. Sure, they allowed him to keep the title of Emperor... but without any power it was meaningless. He might just as well have been dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Alright. Remember, five and six tomorrow. Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Principal Reynolds, good morning.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 REYNOLDS: Walk with me.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 REYNOLDS: Linus, there's been a slight schedule shift. I'm going to need you to supervise detention after school today.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 REYNOLDS: In fact, all week. Cutbacks, budget crises, events above your pay grade... needless to say, some of us have to pull double duty.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: But we have history club today, those kids need me.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 REYNOLDS: There are five students in history club, Linus. They'll live.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Shouldn't we be encouraging the ones with ambition?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 REYNOLDS: Spare me. The club isn't for them, it's for you. It makes you feel needed. Unfortunately, for now, you're needed. In detention. Thanks for your understanding, Linus.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: It's Dr. Linus, actually.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: Oh, for the love of... it's ruined! It's ruined! Oh...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: What's the problem, Leslie?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: Well, formaldehyde. Formaldehyde's the problem. You know what gets out formaldehyde? Nothing. Maybe if I had some frickin' lab aprons I wouldn't have to pay for incompetent students with another trip to Marshall's.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Budget cutbacks...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: How hard would it be for Reynolds to spread out a little of the love to the sciences? I mean, I'm dealing with lab equipment in there from the 1950's. Now why is that?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Principal Reynolds is an administrator. He's not a teacher. He's forgotten what the public school system is about.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: Yeah... summers off in exchange for a crap pension. I'm happy to remind him.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: No. Taking care of the kids, that's what's important.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: Okay, you just keep dreamin'...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Well, I know you've given up but I refuse to.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JOHN: Maybe you should be the principal.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: So says the substitute...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: What do you mean I should be the principal?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JOHN: Just sounds like you care about this place. And if the man in charge doesn't, then maybe it's time for a change.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I appreciate the sentiment, but who's going to listen to me?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JOHN: I'm listenin'.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: How about you tell me what that thing back there was?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: That thing's what killed her friends back at the statue.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: And Jacob, right? It killed Jacob too.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Yeah, of course, and Jacob--
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Of course.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: You're Miles, right? Miles Straume? You communicate with the dead?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: Not technically. I... I can tell you how someone died, pick up their last thoughts before they check out, but... I need to be near their body.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: This is what's left of Jacob's body.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: So tell me, Miles... how did he die?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: Linus killed him.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: What? That's not true!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Are you sure?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: He was standing over Jacob's body with a bloody dagger, so... yeah, I'm pretty sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Jacob was the closest thing I ever had to a father.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: Uh-oh.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: I'm gonna look for some tools and get to work on some shelter. The rest of you see what food's left. Maybe get a fire going.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: Yeah, a fire will fix everything...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Is there anything you'd like me to do?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: You know, that psychic is totally unreliable. Miles actually tried to blackmail me once.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LAPIDUS: You make friends easy, don't you?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I made you one of the turkey meals, with the cranberry sauce that you like.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ROGER: It ain't one of them... lean deals is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: No, dad... it's organic. I'm trying to keep you healthy.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ROGER: Well, it's a little too late for that. How was work?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I have a doctorate in modern European history, and yet I'm babysitting burnouts in detention...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ROGER: Detention, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: And the worst of it is, as I look out at those ingrates that I'm tasked with watching, I can't help thinking that maybe I'm more a loser than any of them.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ROGER: This isn't the life I wanted for you, Ben. I wanted so much more.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I know.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ROGER: That's why I signed up for that damn Dharma Initiative and took you to the island, and... they were decent people. Smarter than I'll ever be. Imagine how different our lives would have been if we'd stayed.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Yes, we'd have both lived happily ever after...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ROGER: No, I'm serious, Ben! Who knows what you would have become?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Now, does that feel better?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ROGER: Ah, yes. Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Alex?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Dr. Linus. Where were you today? We had to cancel history club.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Oh, I'm so sorry, I should've put a note on the door. The club meetings have to be postponed, I'm in detention all week.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Oh yeah? What did you do?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Principal Reynolds needs me to cover, so...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: AP test this Friday. I was kind of... counting on the tutoring.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Alright, how about this? Tomorrow morning, 7 A.M. in the library. And you bring the coffee.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Thanks. God, you're the best, Dr. Linus.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: My pleasure, Alex.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: See you.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 SUN: Excuse me... how long are we going to stay here?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: I told you. I don't know yet.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 SUN: I need to find my husband.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Trust me, if anyone wants to find him, it's me. But I don't know where to look.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 SUN: Why do you want to find Jin?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Because your last name is Kwon. So is his. And I don't know whether I'm supposed to protect you, him, or both of you.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 SUN: Protect us? What are you talking about?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: You're candidates. To replace Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 SUN: Replace him? To do what?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: If you're the one selected, I imagine you'll find out.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 SUN: Wait... you said candidates. How many are there?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Six. There are only six left.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Cheese curds...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Hurley. Come on, wake up.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Come on, let's go. We can make the Temple by nightfall.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: I'm hungry. Let's eat breakfast first.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: No, we can eat on the way.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: What's the rush? You know, maybe we should... take our time.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Because.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: I'm leavin', Hurley. You comin' or not?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Uh-uh, dude. It's this way.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: No, we came this way.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Yeah, but that was a mistake. This is faster. Trust me, it's just around here. It's a short cut.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: No, it's not.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: You're both wrong.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: The Temple's that way.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Where did you come from?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Try me.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: Not yet. But if you wanna go to the Temple, it's this way.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Dude, do you trust that guy?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: At least he's not stallin'.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LAPIDUS: When you're finished in the library, give me a hand gettin' some more firewood.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Just lookin' for something useful...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: God... the things people will bring on a trip...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Oceanic... I remember that plane breakin' in half like it was yesterday.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LAPIDUS: You sound nostalgic.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Maybe I am.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LAPIDUS: You know, I was supposed to be flyin' it. Oceanic 815.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: And why didn't you?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LAPIDUS: I overslept.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Come on...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LAPIDUS: Can you believe it? Imagine how different my life would be had that alarm gone off.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: How different would it have been? The island still got you in the end. Didn't it?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Walk.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Okay, wait, you don't have to--
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Stop! On the ground! Face down!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: What are you doing? Look, if this is about what Miles said--
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Pick it up!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Pick it up and start digging!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Digging what?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: A grave.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: For who?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: You murdered Jacob. It's for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Now, you know this. I know you do.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Expanded Lord Cornwallis' powers as governor general.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Very good. Now, moving on to the Charter Act of 1813. At the time of the Charter, the East India Trading Company's power extended to all of India, except for...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Uh... I don't know!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: It's okay, it's okay. It's just a test.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Just a test? Ha... it's only my entire life, Dr. Linus.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Alex, I think you're being a bit over-dramatic.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Am I? My mom works two jobs just to pay our rent. How am I gonna pay for college? Let alone Yale? Assuming I can even get in...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: You're one of the brightest students I've ever had. I don't worry about your future at all.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Really?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Really. Now, what can I do to help? I'll write you a great letter of recommendation, I'll--
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: No, I need someone who went there. Unfortunately, the only one I know is that pervert Principal Reynolds.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Excuse me? Pervert?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Forget I said that. I was just angry.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Alex... has Principal Reynolds... done something to you?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: What? Ew! No... I swear... it's not that.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Then what is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Dr. Linus, if I tell you, will you promise to keep it between us?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Of course, I promise.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: So, I was in the nurse's office a few months ago... I had a stomach ache and I just went in to find a cot and I fell asleep... when I woke up, after school, in the other room Principal Reynolds was there. And the nurse... well, I guess she forgot I was in there. They were... you know... doing it! In the room right next to me! Where they give kids hearing tests! Isn't that totally gross?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Totally.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Dr. Linus, you're not gonna say something, are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: No. No, a promise is a promise. Well... shall we return to the high seas?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Yeah. Sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: Not exactly tearing it up on the digging front, are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I'm not in a big hurry.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: Brought you some grub. Hope you like green bean and banana 'cause it's all we got.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I'm not really hungry.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: Suit yourself.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Miles... do you remember once you asked me for 3.2 million dollars? Do you still want it?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: What are you gonna do? You gonna write me a check on this banana leaf?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I can get off this island. And when I do, I have a vast network of people and resources that will get you that money. All you have to do is cut me loose.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: Why would I need your money when there are a couple of jabronies under there named Nikki and Paulo who got buried alive with eight million dollars in diamonds on top of them?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I can't believe you're just gonna stand by and watch this happen. Ilana's gonna murder me for killing Jacob, a man who didn't even care about being killed!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: No, he cared.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 MILES: Right up until the second the knife went through his heart, he was hoping he was wrong about you. I guess he wasn't.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Dig!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: So... you're not time-traveling?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: But... you look the same as you did thirty years ago. How's that possible?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: It's not easy to explain.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Is this, like, a Terminator thing? Are you a cyborg?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: No, I'm not a cyborg.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Vampire?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: Jacob gave me a gift.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Jacob? What do you know about him?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: I know he's dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: I thought you said we were going to the Temple, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: I lied.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: Because everyone at the Temple is dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: What do you mean they're all dead? What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: I'm not sure what happened. But I just came from there, and... there's no survivors.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: What about our friends? Sayid? Kate?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: I hope they weren't there. Maybe they made it out alive. All I know is, whatever you're looking for at the Temple, it's not there.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: You didn't want to go back there. Did you know about this?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Jacob kind of, sort of, hinted at it...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: You spoke to Jacob?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: Well, whatever he said... don't believe him.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Where are you goin'?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: There's something I need to do.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: To do what?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: Die.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Do you have a minute?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: Yes. I guess. Might as well give them all F's. Tell me, how hard is it to learn the difference between a genus and species? What do you want?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: You're pretty good with computers aren't you?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: Something tells me you wouldn't be standing here if you didn't already know that I was.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Could you...hypothetically...access someone's email account without their knowledge?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: I...yeah, it depends on the account.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Say a faculty account. Hypothetically
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: Whose?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Nurse Kondraki.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: Kim? Why, you got the hots for her?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: No, I'm just...curious about some of her correspondence.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: With whom?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT:  Okay, that's fine. I didn't come to see you, you came to see me. I don't have time to play twenty questions. Now either you can tell me what it is you're doing, or you can let me finish grading my papers in peace.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: All right. I have reason to believe that she might be engaged in an inappropriate personal relationship with principal Reynolds.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: You're making a play! You're going after the big job, aren't you?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Are you going to help me or not, Leslie?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: I want a good spot. I want Lamour's spot in the main parking lot, the one next to the maple tree. Not under the maple tree, next to the maple tree. That way I get the shade from the maple tree, but not all that tree crap all over the hood of my car. I want aprons. I want lots of aprons, and I want lab equipment in here that was built in this decade, is that a deal?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Deal.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: You know, you really had me fooled with that sweater vest. Linus you're a real killer!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Been here before?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: Yes. And in all the time I've spend on this island, today is the first time I've ever come back.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY:  Jack? Dude where are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: I'm in here.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Do not open that, there's dynamite in there, it's mega unstable.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: I know.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: So did Doctor Arzt. And I was wiping him out of my shirt two days later.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY:  Dude it's time to go.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: No, not yet.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: He's opening up a crate of dynamite, and he said he wanted to kill himself.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: I can't kill myself.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: Even if I wanted to, trust me, I do. I can't kill myself. Which is why I want you to do it for me.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: What I'm talking about Jack is that...Jacob touched me, and when Jacob touches you... well it's considered a gift... except it's not a gift at all. It's a curse.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Dude, seriously! Let's go now!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Why do you want to die?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: I devoted my life, longer than you can possibly imagine, in service of a man who told me that everything was happening for a reason, that he had a plan, plan that I was a part of, when the time was right that he'd share it with me, and now that man's gone so...why do I want to die? Because I just found out my entire life had no purpose. Now if I light this myself it won't work, but you can light it for me Jack. I made the fuse long enough so you'll have time to get out.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Jack! Please tell me you're not actually considering this?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: If he wants to die, there's nothing we're going to do to stop him.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Now, let's talk.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Jack! Dude we gotta go, the guy's crazy, and I know crazy!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Hurley go ahead, we'll be all right.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: Dude you're gonna blow up!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: I've got to talk to him Hurley, just go.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: No, I'm not going without you.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Hurley, I'll be fine.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 HURLEY: If you change your mind, I'll be like a mile away.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: You should go with him Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: No, Richard, no I shouldn't.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: You're gonna die.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Actually I don't think either one of us is gonna die.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: What makes you think that?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: I just came from a lighthouse...where my name was etched in wood on a dial...I turned a mirror that somehow reflected the image of the house I grew up in. Jacob's lighthouse. He got Hurley to bring me out there because he wanted me to see what was reflected in that mirror. For some reason he wanted me to know that he had been watching me ever since I was a kid.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: I have no idea why. But I'm willing to bet you that if Jacob went to that trouble, that he brought me to this island for a reason, and it's not blow up sitting here with you right now.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: That's a pretty big risk you're taking Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: What if you're wrong?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: I'm not.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: Wanna try another stick?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 RICHARD: All right Jack. You seem to have all the answers. Now what?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 JACK: We go back to where we started.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LOCKE: Hello Ben.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LOCKE: Visiting. What are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I'm digging my own grave.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Because you talked me into killing Jacob. You see that woman over there eating a mango? She's his bodyguard and she knows what I did. So now you've got what you wanted because she's going to kill me.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LOCKE: I don't want you to die Ben. In fact I went back to the statue to get you, but you'd already gone.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Get me? For what?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LOCKE: I'm gathering a group to leave this place for good. But once we're gone, someone's going to need to be in charge of the island.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Me?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LOCKE: I can't think of a better man for the job.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Well it doesn't seem very likely does it, under the circumstances. How am I going to get away from...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LOCKE: Come to the other island, to the Hydra station. That's where we'll be.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: She'll come after me.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 LOCKE: 200 yards inland there's a tree in a clearing with a rifle leaning up against it. If you go now you'll get there first, and you'll have the drop on her. But don't hesitate - she won't. See you soon, Ben.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Hey!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 REYNOLDS: Come in.  Linus, I don't have time to listen to you complain about detention.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: That's not why I'm here, I want you to read something.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 REYNOLDS: Well if this is some attempt to revive your little club...
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Those are thirty emails that cover a three-month period. It's pretty lascivious stuff, which would be fine if it was private, but they seem to describe acts that took place on school property. Acts which, morality aside, I think the school board would frown on, not to mention your wife.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 REYNOLDS: What do you want?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Your job. You're going to resign. For, I don't know - personal reasons, health - your call. But with your resignation you're going to recommmend the school board hire me as your replacement. And the irony of all this is that they hold you in such esteem that I'll get the job. So, do we have an understanding?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 REYNOLDS: Linus, may I read you an email? "Dear principal Reynolds, I would appreciate it if you would write a letter of recommendation to Yale on my behalf. It would mean the world to me. Sincerely, Alexandra Rousseau." It's a funny thing about recommendations Linus, they work both ways. So, I put the ball back in your court. You can execute your little Machiavellian manoeuvres, go for my job, sit at my desk, but alas there will be an unfortunate side effect. I will torch Miss Rousseau and her future. Is my job, my power, that important to you? So, what'll it be, Dr. Linus?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Drop it! Put the gun down!
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: What are you waiting for?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I want to explain.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Explain what?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I want to explain that I know what you're feeling.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: You have no idea what I'm feeling.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: I watched my daughter Alex die in front of me. And it was my fault. I had a chance to save her. But I chose the island over her. All in the name of Jacob. I sacrificed everything for him. And he didn't even care. Yeah I stabbed him, I was... so angry...confused...I was terrified that I was about to lose the only thing that had ever mattered to me - my power. But the thing that really mattered was already gone. I'm sorry that I killed Jacob. I am, and I do not expect you to forgive me because...I can never forgive myself.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Then what do you want?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Just let me leave.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Where will you go?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: To Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Because he's the only one that'll have me.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ILANA: I'll have you.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Dr Linus.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Hello Alex.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: I was just coming by to thank principal Reynolds. He wrote me the most incredible letter of recommendation.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Wow, wonderful.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Did you have something to do with it? I mean, I thought he might say some nice things but he really went all out.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: No, it wasn't me Alex. But I always say you're a a great student, obviously I wasn't the only one who noticed.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Thanks, D--
Lost.Season06.Episode06 REYNOLDS: Linus, what the hell are you doing in my office?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Just dropping off the detention sign-up sheet for the week, per your request.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 REYNOLDS: Just put it on the desk.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN:  So will I see you in history club?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: You mean when it's back on?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Oh no, we've got our old slot back. Principal Reynolds found someone to cover for detention. Isn't that right?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 REYNOLDS: Yes, that's right.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Well then, see you at four.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ALEX: Bye.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: Hey, did you do it?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 ARZT: No? No! Wait...what about my parking space?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: You can have mine.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 BEN: Do you need a hand?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 SUN: Please help me with the tarp.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 CREWMAN AT PERISCOPE: Sir, there are people on the beach. Should we stop?
Lost.Season06.Episode06 WIDMORE: No, proceed as planned.
Lost.Season06.Episode06 CREWMAN AT PERISCOPE: Yes sir, Mr. Widmore.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Son of a bitch!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Jin... come on, wake up buddy. Wake up!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 JIN: Sawyer. How long have I been out?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: A while. Figured you could use a rest...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 JIN: Claire and Locke... where are they?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I don't know. They said they'd be back by sun up.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 JIN: We have to get out of here before they come back!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Whoa, whoa! I'm with Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 JIN: That is not Locke!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Yeah... I know. Whoever he is, he says he can get us off this damn island.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 JIN: I can't leave. Sun could be here somewhere.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Fine. If she's here, you've got my word... we ain't leavin' without her.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 JIN: What's that?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: They're back.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Hi.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Hi yourself.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 AVA: Wow. Jimmy, you are... unbelievable.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: You're not too shabby yourself sweetheart.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 AVA: Baby...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Yeah ?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 AVA: Weren't you supposed to meet that guy at nine?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Yeah. So?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 AVA: It's 8:42.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Damn it!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: You weren't exactly supposed to see that...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 AVA: Jimmy, what are you doing with all that money?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: This meeting... it's a potential investment, we're going fifty-fifty. The guy wants to see the money up front. Don't worry it won't take long. I'll be right back. Me and you'll go for a round.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Whoa...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 AVA: Step away from the case.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Take it easy, honey...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 AVA: Here's the thing, dimples. I can spot a con man. I'm married to one. So I know all about the pigeon drop. Oh, what? That case just accidentally flew open? How stupid do you think I am?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Pretty damn stupid actually.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 AVA: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: This is a setup, lady. There's a van sitting right outside. The room is bugged... place is surrounded by cops. So now you wanna put that gun down and we'll work something out. They don't care about you, they want your husband. There's a tracer in the case, all you had to do is take it back to wherever your hubby's hiding out.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 AVA: You really expect me to believe that you're here with the police? This place is surrounded? How come no-one came to save you?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I don't need saving. 'Cause you're gonna do the right thing and put that gun down. But if you don't... well, then all I gotta do is say the magic word and that door busts open.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 AVA: You're a lousy con man.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: LaFleur.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 AVA: La what?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 POLICE OFFICER: Police! Drop the gun!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Cutting it a little close, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Only way to cut it.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Put your damn clothes on, Jim.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: You got it, partner.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 AVA: You're a cop?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Surprise.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Is this where you lived?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CLAIRE: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: What is that?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CLAIRE: It's all I had.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Alright everybody, listen up. Come on in, gather round. I know that everyone is tired. It was a... a long and traumatic night for all of us. And you all have got a lot of questions, I know. And I will make myself available to answer them. But right now we need to keep moving. We have to take advantage of the daylight.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CINDY: We want to know what happened to the people who stayed behind at the Temple.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: The black smoke killed them.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Hey... I know that what happened back there was really scary. But it's over. You're with me now, and I promise that I'm gonna take care of you. Okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Alright, let's move out!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Looks like you had a hell of a night.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Jack, Hurley, the rest of them... they make it out of the temple all right?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: I saw them leaving on the way back.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What about Miles?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: I don't know what happened to him. So you're with Locke now?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I ain't with anybody, Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Hello, is this Anthony Cooper? Hi Mr Cooper, this is Detective James Ford, L.A.P.D. Yeah, we've discovered some unclaimed property that might belong to you. Can you verify you were in Alabama in 1976? Uh huh... okay, thanks. Sorry to have taken up your time.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: May I speak with Anthony Cooper?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Sorry, I'm going to have to call you back...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Who's Anthony Cooper?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Old buddy I ran into. Said he could hook me up with some Laker tickets.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: That's cool. What'd you... you see him in Palm Springs?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Palm Springs. Your trip last weekend?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Yeah. It's a blur. Too much sunshine, too many Mai Tais...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Well get it together, because you got a date tonight, pal.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Date with who?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Friend of mine. Works with my dad at the museum. She's great.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Well if she's so great, why don't you go out with her?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Hey, I got a girlfriend. What is your deal Jim? You wanna die alone?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Alright, look...I go out with her, are you gonna leave me alone?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Throw in one of those Laker tickets, hell yes I will.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Look I'm...already pulling strings with this guy. It's just, uh... I don't know if I can get another seat...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: You know you can tell me the truth. About anything. Are you lying to me, man?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Why the hell would I lie?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: About a quarter mile ahead there's a clearing. We'll make camp there. Everybody fill up on water. We might be there a couple of days.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: A couple of days? I thought you said we were getting off this rock?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: We are.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: When?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Maybe we should talk about this in private.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Great. Let's go.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: I wish you hadn't interrupted me.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I'm sorry... I forgot my manners.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: I forgive you.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What happened back at the temple? How'd you know to rescue everybody from that smoke thing?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: I didn't rescue them. I'm the smoke thing.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: You telling me you killed all of those people?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: I gave them the opportunity to leave peacefully and they didn't take it.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Why not?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Because they're convinced that they're protecting the Island from me, when in fact all I want to do is leave. So it's either kill or be killed. And I don't wanna be killed.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: You goin' on a boat ride?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: You are.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Where?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Hydra Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What's on Hydra Island?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: The plane. The Ajira flight. The same plane that brought your friends back. Unfortunately they didn't come alone. And I have reason to believe that some of the other passengers mean to do us all harm. So I want you to go over there and do some recon.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Well that sounds safe...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: You'll be fine.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Yeah? And what am I supposed to do if I run into somebody who wants to do me harm?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: I'm not worried about that.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Oh, you're not, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: No. Because you are the best liar I ever met. You tell them whatever you need to tell them to gain their trust... find out everything you can about them... and then get back here.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Why exactly am I doing this again?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Why do you think, James? We get on that plane, we fly off this Island, and we never look back. Come on.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Yeah?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Miles, what does this girl look like again?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: She's a redhead. How many redheads do you see?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Roger that.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Be nice to her.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Yeah, yeah...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Excuse me. Would you be Charlotte?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: I most certainly am.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Well... it's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Archaeology, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: What's wrong with archaeology?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Nothin'. I just figured you'd be stuck in a room somewhere dustin' off antiques.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: No, I actually get to travel quite a bit. To far off and romantic places.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Really? What are you, like a... Indiana Jones or somethin'?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: Yes. I'm exactly like Indiana Jones.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: You got a whip?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: Maybe...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: So, um... what about you?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What about me?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: Why did you become a cop?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: You ever seen Bullitt? Steve McQueen flick?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Well then I won't even bore you with an explanation.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: Okay, do me a favor, James, and don't treat me like all the other girls that ask you. Tell me the truth.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Well... I guess I... got to a point in my life where I was either going to become a criminal or a cop. So I chose cop.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: You know what.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: Wow... not bad, considering we didn't have that whip.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Bring it next time.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: You want some water?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: Mmm hmm. Yes please.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: You mind if I borrow a t-shirt?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Help yourself. Top drawer on the right.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: Thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What the hell are you doin'?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: Um... I was just looking for a t-shirt...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What did you see?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: Nothing. Just this, you know, that picture fell out and I was trying to put it back.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What did you see?!?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: Nothing, I didn't see anything!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Get the hell out.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: James, just let me explain!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Get out!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAYID: Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Do you believe Locke?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAYID: What do you mean?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: That he can get us off the island...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAYID: Yes, I believe him.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Sayid, are you alright?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAYID: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Claire!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Sayid! Sayid, please!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: What are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CLAIRE: She took him! She took Aaron!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Claire, you had disappeared! Kate couldn't find you! She did what she had to do!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CLAIRE: She took Aaron! She can't just do this!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: This is completely inappropriate. Alright? Now... you go over there. I'll deal with you in a minute. Go.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: You alright?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: No, I'm not alright!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Hey, stop!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Don't move!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: Please don't hurt me!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Who the hell are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: I'm the only one left.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LIAM: Excuse me. Sir? I asked you about my brother...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 OFFICER: I told you, I'll be with you in a minute.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LIAM: Hey! Uh... I'm looking for my brother. He was arrested at the airport on a drug charge.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Sorry, not my department.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Mornin', sunshine.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Come with me.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Whoa--
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Shut up! Is there something you wanna tell me?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What?!?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Is there something you wanna tell me?!?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Look, she opened the wrong drawer.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: What the hell are you talking about? I wanna know what you were doing in Australia when you told me you were in Palm Springs. I ran your credit card. I know you went to Sydney. Oceanic, round trip. You took flight 815 back two days ago.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What the hell are you doin' runnin' my credit card?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: You lied to me! We're supposed to trust each other. So, Jim... what were you doing in Australia?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: That's none of your damn business.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: You know what? You're right. Because I'm not your partner anymore.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: You thirsty?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: Very.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I'm Sawyer.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: I'm Zoe. I can't believe there's anybody left alive. I thought I knew everybody on the plane.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I didn't come on this plane.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: What plane did you come on?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Long story. What the hell happened here? What killed all those people?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: I... we... we crashed here. And we were all just waiting for someone to rescue us. I was out collecting wood when I heard... screaming.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Screaming?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: When I came back... they were... they were all dead. I spent the last two days dragging their bodies up here. I didn't feel it was right to leave them out there in the sun. Are you alone?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: No. There's a group of people back on the main island. I can take you back there.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: Thank God...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Trust me... God's got nothing to do with it.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: I'm sorry, Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: I have to take responsibility for Claire's behaviour. I was the one who told her the Others had her baby.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Why would you tell her that?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Have you ever had an enemy? Someone that you needed to hate? Very powerful, isn't it? Claire was devastated without Aaron. She needed something to... something to keep her going. So, I gave her something to hate. And then... when you told her the truth... all those feelings, all that anger that she'd been holding on to for so long... it had to go somewhere.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Very insighful... coming from a dead man.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Well, nobody's perfect. I'm sorry that this happened. And I'm sure if you give her time, everything will be alright. I promised before that I would keep everyone safe. And that means you too, Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Where did Sawyer go?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: I'll show you.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Think that thing'll still fly?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: I don't know. It'll take a bit of work and someone who knows how... how to do it. I... I take it you haven't come across the pilot?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: No ma'am.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: How many people did you say were with you?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Couple dozen...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: Did they all come on the same plane as you?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Some. Not all.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: When did you crash?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: A long time ago.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: Do you all have guns?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: I mean... whoever killed all those people back there, they... they might come back.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Yeah, we got plenty of guns.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Wanna grab that end?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Where did you say you were headed?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: What's that?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Your flight. Where were you goin'?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: Oh. Uh... Guam.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What's in Guam?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: My boyfriend.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: You're good, sweetheart, but you ain't that good.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MAN: Put your weapon down! Drop it, now!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Is your name even Zoe?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: Is yours Sawyer?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MAN: Down on your knees!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Alright, alright... you got me. Take me to your leader.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: That island over there... that's where I sent Sawyer.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: You could have just told me that you sent him to the island where we were locked in cages, you didn't have to bring me down here.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Sure, but then I wouldn't have gotten to talk to you. You referred to me as a dead man. I am not a dead man. I know what you're feeling, Kate. I know what you're going through.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: And how do you know that?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Because... my mother was crazy. Long time ago, before I... looked like this... I had a mother, just like everyone. She was a very disturbed woman. And, as a result of that, I had some growing pains. Problems that I'm still trying to work my way through. Problems that could have been avoided had things been different.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Why are you telling me this?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Because now Aaron has a crazy mother too.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: Get in. He's waiting for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LAURA: It's not me I'm worried about. I just don't know what I would do if anything ever happened to you or Ma.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLES: Anyway, nothing's gonna happen to us. Not today, anyway. That's the way you live this life. Each day, one at a time. Now, if you spend your whole life worryin' about something that's gonna happen, before you know it, your life's over and you spent an awful lot of it just worryin'.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLES: Hey, you heard that? Now that's what life's all about. Laughin' and lovin' each other. And knowin' that people aren't really gone when they die. We have all the good memories to sustain us until we see 'em again.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LAURA: It's hard not being afraid, Pa...
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLES: I know, sweetheart. I know.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: You've got to be joking.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: May I come in?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: Absolutely not.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Why not?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CHARLOTTE: You don't get to kick me out at three o'clock in the morning and then come around the next day with puppy dog eyes and a sad sunflower. Look, I don't know if you're just lonely, or guilty, or completely mad... but, you know what? I don't care. You blew it.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What do you got in here?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: None of your business. Keep moving.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 WIDMORE: Come.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: He's here, sir.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 WIDMORE: Thanks, Zoe.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 WIDMORE: Would you leave us please?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 ZOE: Of course.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 WIDMORE: Hello, Mr. Ford. My name is Charles Widmore.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 WIDMORE: Do you know who I am?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Of course I do. You're the fella that sent a freighter to the island loaded with guys to kill us all.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 WIDMORE: It's sad, really... how little you actually know.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Well, I know you murdered all them people out there and dropped 'em in a ditch.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 WIDMORE: We didn't murder those people. But I don't expect you to believe that.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Good, I don't.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 WIDMORE: So, why don't you tell me what brought you over to this island.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: John Locke sent me.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 WIDMORE: John Locke's dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I think we both know the guy I'm talking about's not really Locke. Here's the deal, Chief... I'll go back over there and tell him the coast is clear, that I didn't find anybody. Then I'll bring the old man right to your doorstep... then you can kill him.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 WIDMORE: And what do you want in exchange, James?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: One: The people I come back with, people on my boat don't get touched. Not even a hair on their head. And two: You give us safe passage off the Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 WIDMORE: How do I know I can trust you?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Same way I know I can trust you. So, do we have an agreement?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 WIDMORE: I suppose we do.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CLAIRE: Kate. I just wanna say I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that. I know everything you did was just 'cause you care about me and about Aaron. Thank you. And thank you for taking care of him.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 CLAIRE: I'm sorry, I'm so, so, sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: It's okay. It's okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: How'd it go?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: You didn't really send me over there to find passengers from that plane, did you?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Well in case you're interested, they're all dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Well that's terrible. What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I don't know.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Well what do you know, James?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I know there's a man over there on that island that ain't gonna let us get on that plane without a fight. Came over on a sub. Name's Widmore.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Charles Widmore?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Well, I guess y'all know each other. He ain't alone. Counted at least six armed compadres with him, not to mention whatever crew's on that sub. There's a locked room on there, something they're hiding. And they're setting up pylons, like the ones in New Otherton. You know, ones that keep out that smoke thing.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: Now what did you tell them about me?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I told 'em I'd tell you the coast was clear, and bring you back with me...walk you right into their trap. That way they could kill you. Which means they'll be caught with their pants down when we change our plan of attack.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 LOCKE: I appreciate your loyalty, James.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: You said you were gonna get me off this Island. Deal's a deal.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Get in the car.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Who's Sawyer?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: When I was nine years old...my father shot my mother, then he killed himself. Sawyer was the reason why. He was a grifter...con man. I've been hunting him down since the day I left the academy. I chased down a lead in Australia, got a name - Anthony Cooper - I ran the name, I got a list of Anthony Coopers and I've been calling them. And when I find the right one...I'm gonna kill him.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Why didn't you tell me any of this?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I knew you'd try to talk me out of it.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 MILES: Damn right.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Fair enough.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Whoa! My car!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Hey!
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: What's for dinner?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Rabbit. I think.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Good, I'm starving.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: What are you doing running errands for Locke?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I ain't running errands for nobody.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: He said he sent you over to the other island. Did you find the plane?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: Yeah, and that ain't the only thing over there. Guy named Widmore set up camp over on the beach. Got a whole team with him - guys with guns - they're here for Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: So what are you gonna do?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: I'm gonna let them fight it out. And while they got their hands full with each other...you and me are getting the hell off this Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode07 KATE: Even if we could get on that plane, who's gonna fly it?
Lost.Season06.Episode07 SAWYER: We ain't taking the plane, Freckles. Taking the sub.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Извини, что не смог прийти раньше 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ILANA: Я очень рада тебя видеть 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: I'm here because I need your help. Will you help me, Ilana?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ILANA: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: There are six people I need you to protect. I'm gonna give you a list of their names. This is what you've been preparing for.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ILANA: Are these people... who are they?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: They're the remaining candidates.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: Candidates? Candidates for what?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 SUN: To replace Jacob. She said I was one of them and so are you and so is Hurley.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 LAPIDUS: Well, that's great. So what do we do now?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ILANA: I don't know.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: Then, who does?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ILANA: After I've brought them to the temple, what do I do?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Ask Ricardus, he'll know what to do next.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: Who's Ricardus?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ILANA: He is. So, Richard, what do we do next?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD:  Uhh.. I have no idea what we do next. You didn't tell your friends that I was trying to kill myself when you found me? That sounds like someone who has a plan?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ILANA: Why would Jacob say you knew what to do if--
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Because everything he ever said is a lie.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: What are you talking about?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: You wanna know a secret, Jack? Something I've known a long, long time. You're dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: You mean that figuratively right?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: No, I mean literally. We are all dead, every single one of us. And this, this, all this, it's not what you think it is. We're not on an island, we never were. We're in Hell. So, I'm not interested in what Jacob said. In fact, maybe it's time to stop listening to him, and we started listening to someone else, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: What are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ILANA: I'm going after Richard.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: Why? You heard him he doesn't... doesn't know what we need to do next.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ILANA: He knows! Jacob told me. He has to know.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: Alpert has lost his mind. He thinks that we're, we're in hell. If he cared about what Jacob said, he wouldn't be talking about, about listening to someone else.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: Wait, you know who he meant?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 BEN: Oh, this should be interesting.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 SUN: He meant Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: Locke is dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 BEN: If it's any consolation, it's not exactly Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: ¿Por qué? Que no sé. Sí, yo te puedo ayudar, pero yo no sé como encontrarlo si no sé cómo....  Why? I don't know. Yes, I can help you, but... I don't know how to find him.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: Hurley! What's he saying?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: Uh, what's who saying?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: Jacob, I saw you talking to him.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: I'm not talking to Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: Don't lie to me. Please, if you know something, anything that can help us figure out--
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: It's not Jacob, man!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACK: Then, who is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 Hurley: Sorry Jack, but this has nothing to do with you.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 BEN: Shephard is right, you know.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ILANA: Right about what?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 BEN: Richard. Going after him is a waste of time. He doesn't know anything.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ILANA: And what makes you so sure?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 BEN: I've known him since I was twelve years old, that should count for something.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 LAPIDUS: So you guys met when you were kids, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 BEN: No Frank, I was a kid. Richard looked just like he does today.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 LAPIDUS: You're saying this guy doesn't age.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 BEN: That's exactly what I'm saying.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 LAPIDUS: And how the hell do you think that happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: ¿Eres tú, Ricardo? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Sí, soy yo. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Vuelve a dormir, Isabella. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Estás hirviendo. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: Estoy bien. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Voy a buscar al doctor. Si Dios quiere, mi amor, regreso antes del amanecer. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Espero que tengamos suficiente. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: Dale esto al doctor. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICARDO: No, no, no, no, Isabella, no. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: Tómalo, mi amor. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Si algo te pasa... 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: Cierra tus ojos. Siempre estaremos juntos. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Te voy a salvar. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 SERVANT: ¡No, no puede entrar, no! ¡No puede usted, no debe entrar, no puede pasar! 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Perdón, perdón... Perdóneme usted, pero no podía esperar, mi mujer está muy enferma, señor. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 DOCTOR: Dale unas cobijas. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Muchísimas gracias, señor. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 DOCTOR: No son para ti, me estás goteando el piso. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Mi esposa está tosiendo sangre. Ella lo necesita, por favor, señor. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 DOCTOR: ¿Dónde viven? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Cerca de El Socorro. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 DOCTOR: ¿El Socorro? Ese es un viaje de medio día. Yo no voy a cabalgar hasta allá con esta lluvia torrencial. Tengo una medicina que le puede salvar la vida, pero es muy cara. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Sí, sí, claro, lo que sea. Sí, muchísimas gracias, señor. .]
Lost.Season06.Episode08 DOCTOR: ¿Esto es todo lo que tienes? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Ahora lo tiene todo. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 DOCTOR: Esto no vale nada. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: No, no, no. No, por favor, señor. Haré lo que sea para pagarle. Por favor, se lo ruego... 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 DOCTOR: ¡Suéltame! ¡Quítame las manos de encima! ¡Te he dicho..! ¡Quítame las manos de encima! 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Isabella, Isabella.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: Te traje un poco de comida, hijo mío. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD:  No tengo hambre, padre. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: Tal vez la tendrás después. ¿Me permites ver tu Biblia? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: ¿Está en inglés? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Sí. Yo me he estado enseñando yo mismo. Isabella... mi esposa y yo íbamos a ir al Nuevo Mundo. Queríamos comenzar una familia, una vida nueva. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: ¿Estás listo para confesarte? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: In Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amén. Perdóneme, padre, porque he pecado. Padre, yo... yo maté a un hombre. De verdad me arrepiento. Y le ruego, le ruego, padre, por el perdón de Dios. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: ¿Cómo? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: No te puedo otorgar la absolución por un asesinato. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Padre, fue un accidente, yo no quería matar a ese señor. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: Pero lo hiciste. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Por favor, Padre, debe de haber alguna manera para recibir el perdón de Dios 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: La única manera de regresar a Su gracia es a través de la penitencia. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Sí, claro, haré lo que sea. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: ¡Pero tú no tienes tiempo para nada! Porque mañana... mañana te van a colgar. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: No, hijo mío. Me temo que el diablo te espera en el infierno. Que Dios tenga misericordia de tu alma.  awaits you in hell. May God have mercy on your soul.]
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: Véndenle los ojos. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Señor, por favor, perdona mis pecados, estoy penitente y arrepentido (x4, not clear) 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: Is this him?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: ¿Qué están haciendo?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 PRIEST: ¡Estate quieto!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: You say he speaks English?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 FATHER SUAREZ: Yes, Mr Whitfield.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: Do you speak English?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: I asked do you speak English? Take him away and bring me another. Hang him.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Yes! I speak English! I speak English!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: Wait! You have strong hands, what sort of work did you do?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: I worked...I worked in the fields.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: I understand you were interested in going to the New World?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: Well then, this is your lucky day. Thank you Father.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: This man is now the property of Captain Magnus Hanso. Hope you don't get seasick.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Ignacio. ¿Puedes ver algo? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 IGNACIO: Está demasiado oscuro. ¡Espera, puedo ver tierra! ¡Veo la costa! ¡Es una isla! 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 IGNACIO: ¡Veo el Diablo! ¡Esta isla está protegida por el Diablo! ! The island is guarded by the devil!]
Lost.Season06.Episode08 IGNACIO: Dios nos tuvo piedad. Al menos, a algunos de nosotros. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 VOICE FROM OUTSIDE THE SHIP: Do you see anything?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 OTHER VOICE: No, no.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: You, Pierce, bring me the Captain.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 PIERCE: Sir, Captain Hanso is dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: Good God we're in the middle of the bloody jungle!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD:  ¡Ayuda! ¡Ayuda! ¡Aquí abajo!  Help, help, down here!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 OTHER PRISONER: ¡Estamos vivos! ¡Estamos aquí abajo! 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 OTHER PRISONER: ¡Gracias Dios, gracias! ¡Muchas gracias! 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 IGNACIO: No!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD:  No, stop! Stop!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: No! Stop!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: No! What are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 IGNACIO: Se lo ruego. No lo haga. No lo haga, por favor. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: We are shipwrecked in the middle of the jungle. We have no fresh water, and limited supplies, and there are only five officers left.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Why, why are you doing this?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: Because if I freed you, it'd only be a matter of time before you tried to kill me.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: No!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: What happened up there?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JONAS: I said report!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Santo Padre que estás en el cielo, santificado sea Tu nombre, vénganos Tu reino. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: ¡Vete de aquí! ¡Te voy a matar! ¡Te voy a matar! 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: ¿Hola? ¿Hay alguien aquí? ¿Se encuentra alguien aquí? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Sí... ¡Sí, estoy aquí! ¿Isabella? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELA: Ricardo... Ricardo...
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: No lo entiendo. ¿Cómo estás tú aquí? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: ¿No lo sabes, Ricardo? Estamos muertos los dos. Estamos en el infierno. Estoy aquí para salvarte antes de que regrese "él". . I'm here to save you before he comes back.]
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: ¿Cómo? ¿Antes de que regrese quién? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: El diablo. .]
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: ¿El diablo? ?]
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: Yo miré en sus ojos, y todo lo que vi fue maldad. ¿Tú lo has visto, Ricardo? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Sí, yo creo que sí. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Mi amor... 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: Tenemos que salir de aquí. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: ¡Corre! ¡Vete, vete! ¡Corre, mi amor! No... debes irte, ¡ya vete! 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: No puedo. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: ¡No! ¡Dije que te iba a salvar, mi amor! ¡No! ¡Dije que te iba a salvar, y lo haré, mi amor! Por favor. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: ¡Ricardo, por favor! ¡Tengo miedo! 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Yo sé, pero... ¡si me quieres, vete! ¡Vete! 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: ¡No, no! ¡Déjala en paz! ¡Déjala! ¡Déjala en paz, por favor! ¡¿Isabella?! ¡¿Isabella?! 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Shhh. Here, water.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: A friend.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: I am... in Hell?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Yes, I'm afraid you are.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: You... you were not on the ship.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: I was here long before your ship.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Did... did you see my, my wife?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Isabella, my wife. She was here. She was. But then the black smoke came and she ran.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: And she hasn't come back?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: That probably means he has her.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Who?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: I think you know who.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: If she's alive I must save her, please, please help.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Of course. Of Course I'll help. I want to be free too.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: As luck would have it, I found these on one of the officers outside. I think they'll work. But before I try, I need to know that you will help me.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Yes, yes, yes, I do of course.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: You'd do anything I ask?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Yes yes, anything, yes, I promise.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Then we're agreed.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Of course my friend. It's good to see you out of those chains.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Got to get you on your feet. Gonna need your strength if we're going to escape.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Escape?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: That's right. I'm afraid there's only one way to escape from Hell. You're going to have to kill the Devil.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: When you're finished eating, you walk due west. Once you get to the ocean, you'll be able to see the Statue.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: What statue?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Your ship smashed through it, on its way inland. Broke it into pieces. That's where you'll find the Devil.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: You only have one chance. Put this through his chest. Do not hesitate, do not let him say a word. If he speaks, it will already be too late. He can be very persuasive.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: How, how can I kill him with this, he's...black smoke.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: No. I am.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: My wife Isabella, she was running from you?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: She was running from him. I'm sorry. I saw him take her but I couldn't do anything to stop it.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: But if you are the black smoke...
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: You aren't the only one who's lost something, my friend. The Devil betrayed me. He took my body. My humanity.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: You killed the officers on the ship.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: I'm not the one you need to worry about. The Devil has your wife, and you are going to have to kill him if you ever want to get her back.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Murder is wrong. That is what brought me here.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: My friend, you and I can talk all day long about what's right or wrong, but the question before you remains the same - "Do you ever want to see your wife again?"
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Yes I do.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: What are you doing here? Who gave you this?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Where is my wife?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Where is my wife?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: I don't know your wife. Did she come here on the ship?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: No, she's dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Then why are you asking me where she is? Did you meet a man in the jungle dressed in black?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: What did he tell you?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: He said you are the devil.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: And?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: He said the only way I would see my wife again is if I kill you. I - I saw her, here, in this place. Where is she?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: That wasn't your wife.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Yes, it was! She's dead, just like me.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: You're not dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: I am in Hell. I know that I am in Hell.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: You really think you're dead?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Where else would I be?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Alright then.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: What are you doing? What are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Still think you're dead?!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Stop!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Still think you're dead?! Why should I stop?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Because I want to live!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: That's the first sensible thing you've said. What's your name?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Ricardo.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Ricardo... Get up, we need to talk.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: What is inside?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: No one comes in unless I invite them in. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Are you the Devil?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB:  No.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Then who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: My name is Jacob. I'm the one who brought your ship to this island.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: You brought it here? Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Think of this wine as what you keep calling hell. There's many other names for it too: malevolence, evil, darkness. And here it is, swirling around in the bottle, unable to get out because if it did, it would spread. The cork  is this island and it's the only thing keeping the darkness where it belongs. That man who sent you to kill me believes that everyone is corruptible because it's in their very nature to sin. I bring people here to prove him wrong. And when they get here, their past doesn't matter.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Before you brought my ship, there were others?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Yes, many.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: What happened to them?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: They're all dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: But if you brought them here, why didn't you help them?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Because I wanted them to help themselves. To know the difference between right and wrong without me having to tell them. It's all meaningless if I have to force them to do anything. Why should I have to step in?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: If you don't, he will.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Do you want a job?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: A job?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Doing what?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Well, I don't want to step in. Maybe you can do it for me. You can be my...my representative and intermediary between me and the people I bring to the island.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: What will I get in return?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: You tell me.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: I want my wife back.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Can't do that.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Can you absolve me of my sins so I don't go to Hell?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: I can't do that either.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: I never want to die. I want to live forever.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Now that...
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: ...I can do.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: You let him talk to you, didn't you?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: He told me to give you this.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: I'm sure you realize that if you go with him, you'll never see your wife again? I understand. He can be very... convincing. But I want you to know if you ever change your mind, and I mean ever, my offer still stands.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: I have something for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: You must've dropped it. I found it on the ship.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Adiós, mi amor. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: I've changed my mind. Are you listening to me? I've changed my mind. I was wrong. You said I could change my mind. You said the offer would stand. Does the offer still stand? Does the offer still stand?! Does the offer still stand?!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: What offer, dude?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: What the Hell are you doing here? Did you follow me?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: Well, kind of.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Get out! Get out!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: Hey!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Didn't you hear what I said?!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: I was just trying--
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: I told you people, I don't know anything!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: Just calm down!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Why did you follow me?!
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: Your wife sent me.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: What did you say?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: I said your wife sent me. Isabella. She wants to know why you buried her cross.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: H--how do you know about that?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: Because she just told me.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: What do you mean, just told you?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: Isabella saw you dig it up, man. She's standing right next to you.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: Él no te cree. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: A veces a las personas les toma un poco. .]
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: I--I don't see her.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: Dile que su inglés es magnífico. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: She's right there. She says your English is awesome.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: ¿Estás tú realmente aquí? 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: Cierra tus ojos.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: She wants you to close your eyes. It's okay, I'll tell you what she says.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: No fue tu culpa que yo morí, Ricardo.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: No fue tu culpa que yo morí, Ricardo. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: Por más que quisiste salvarme, era mi hora. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: Ya has sufrido suficiente, Ricardo. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Te extraño, yo... Yo haría cualquier cosa para estar juntos de nuevo. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 ISABELLA: Mi amor, ya estamos juntos. 
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Is she gone?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: Yeah, you got it.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: Something wrong?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: She kinda said one more thing. Something you have to do.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 RICHARD: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 HURLEY: She said you have to stop the Man in Black. You have to stop him from leaving the island. 'Cause if you don't... todos nos vamos al infierno. .]
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Good morning
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Morning.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: I see you got my present.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Don't gloat, Jacob. It doesn't become you.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: So you tried to kill me?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: You expect an apology?
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: No. I guess I'm just wondering why you did it.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Because I want to leave. Just let me leave, Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: As long as I'm alive, you're not going anywhere.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Well then, now you know why I want to kill you. And I will kill you, Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Even if you do so, somebody else will take my place.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Then I'll kill them too.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: Here. Something for you to pass the time.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 JACOB: I'll see you around.
Lost.Season06.Episode08 MAN IN BLACK: Sooner than you think.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: Want some cocoa?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KATE: Where'd you find cocoa?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: I didn't. Pretend.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: How's the leg?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: Still hurts.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: You should leave the bandage off for a while. The air'll do it some good.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: I'll try that.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: You mind if I sit down?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: I know you and I haven't had time to talk, but I was wondering if James had filled you in on what I showed him at the cliffs?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: You mean the cave? The one with the names on the wall?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Most of the names have been crossed off now. There are just a few left. Kwon is one of them.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: Does that mean me or Sun?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Well Jin, I'm not sure. But what it does mean is that the only way we can leave the island is if all the names that haven't been crossed off go together.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: But, Sun is not here...
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: You just take care of that leg. I'm workin' on it.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SECURITY OFFICER: Alright Mr. Kwon, here's your suitcase and your watch.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: Money?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SECURITY OFFICER: I'm sorry, federal law says we have to confiscate the $25,000.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: Confiscate?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SECURITY OFFICER: It means that if you want it back, you're gonna have to fill out the necessary paperwork.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: And... the money...
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SECURITY OFFICER: You can exit right over there, sir.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 가자. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 괜찮아요? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 식당에서 만나기로 한 약속도 놓쳤잖아! 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 그 돈은 뭐에요? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 나도 몰라. 우리 바로 떠나기 전에 아버님이 시계하고 같이 전해주라고 주신거야. 아버님께 질문할 입장도 아니고, 시키는 대로 할 뿐이야. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 CLERK: May I help you?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: Paik.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 CLERK: A reservation for Paik...
Lost.Season06.Episode09 CLERK: Yes, I've got it right here. I've got a beautiful oceanview room for you on the eighth floor.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: Two room. Two! No marry.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 CLERK: Oh...
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: Kwon. Jin-Soo Kwon.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 CLERK: I'm sorry, I apologize... yes, there is a separate room reservation for Kwon. Room 842. Here you go, sir.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 CLERK: Miss. Paik, Mr. Kwon... welcome to Los Angeles.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: I'm leavin' for a little while. I got an errand to run.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAYID: When will you be back?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Morning. Keep an eye on the camp while I'm gone.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAYID: I don't feel anything.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAYID: Anger. Happiness. Pain. I don't feel it anymore.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Maybe that's best, Sayid. It'll help you get through what's coming.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: What're you doin', Hoss?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: I'm getting out of here before that thing comes back.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: What thing?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: Locke. And you're just sitting around here listening to whatever he tells you...
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: I ain't listenin' to nobody! I already told you I have a deal with Widmore, so if you just--
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: It doesn't matter who you have a deal with! I've waited long enough. I'm going to find my wife.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: Find her where?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: Go back to the temple. And if she's not there I'll try the beach. But I will find Sun so stop trying to--
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SEAMUS: Is this the guy?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: Yeah. Let's take him.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MILES: Play your card, captain.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 BEN: Now what?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ILANA: We wait.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 BEN: Wait... for what?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ILANA: For Richard to come back.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 BEN: You'll forgive my skepticism, but... the last thing Richard said before he went stomping off into the jungle was that we were all in Hell and he had no idea what we were supposed to do next! In fact, I would bet money we never see him again!
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ILANA: Hugo will find him. He will track him down and bring him back.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MILES: Unless Alpert's covered in bacon grease, I'm not sure Hurley can track anything...
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Hey, don't talk about bacon.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ILANA: Jacob has never lied to me before. If he said Richard knows what to do, then Richard knows what to do. He'll come back. And until then, we wait.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: How are the tomatoes?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: Dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: I remember when you first planted this here. Feels like a hundred years ago...
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: You don't believe Alpert's coming back, do you?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: I don't care if he comes back.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: What about us... being candidates?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: What about it?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: Hurley took me to a lighthouse. To Jacob's lighthouse. And there was a mirror. And all around it there were... there were hundreds of names written down.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: I don't care. I don't care about Alpert, or being a candidate.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: Sun... there was a reason why we were--
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: I don't want to hear about how this is our purpose or destiny! I just want you to go away and leave me alone!
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 진수 씨... 뭐하는 거에요? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 이 시계를 전하러 이렇게 멀리까지 왔는데... 식당엘 가 봐야겠어. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 들어오지 않을래요? 이런 얘기 여기서 하고싶지 않아요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 지금 열한시 반이에요. 이 시간에 누가 식당에 있겠어요? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 그래도 가보긴 해야지. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 진수 씨. 그 사람, 우리 아빠 직원이에요. 그렇게 걱정할 필요가 없어요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 무슨 상관이야. 자긴 여기 쇼핑만 하러 온 거 아니야? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 나에 대해서 그렇게밖에 생각 못해요? 내가 그냥 여기 쇼핑하러 온 것 같아? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 아닌가? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 왜? 단추 채우라고 하지 그래? 기내 안에서 했던 것 처럼? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 사람들이 많았잖아. 누군가 우리를 보고 있을수도 있고. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 우릴 보는 사람은 아무도 없어. 그래서... 단추를 채우라는 거야, 말라는 거야? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 아니. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 그럼... 이거는요? [Subtitle: What about... this one?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 아니지. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 이것도? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 그건... 당연히 아니지. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Sun...
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Bad day?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: I found your husband.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: I promised you I would reunite you two... took me a little longer than I thought it would... but he's with my people, back at my camp across the island. I can take you to him right now.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: I don't believe you. You killed those people at the temple.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Those people were confused. They were lied to. I didn't want to hurt them. Any one of them could have chosen to come with me. And I'm giving you that choice, Sun... right now. I would never make you do anything against your will. I'm asking you. Please. Come with me. Jin is waiting.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Sun!
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Sun, wait!
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 좋은 생각이 있어요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 뭔데? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 우리 도망가요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 뭐? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 농담 아니야. 같이 도망가요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 돈도 없이 어떻게? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 내 앞으로 된 계좌가 있어요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 아니, 이게 다 처음부터 계획한거야? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 화났어요? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 아니... 그렇지만 그건 말도 안돼. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 내가 묻는 말에만 대답해요. 날 사랑해요? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 자기 잘 알잖아, 내가 얼마나 사랑하는지. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 좋아요. 당신이 알아야 될 게 있어요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 누구지? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 글쎄요. 사인을 걸어놨는데? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 잔다고 그냥 보내. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Miss Paik? Hi. I'm, uh... Martin Keamy.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: I'm a friend of your father's.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Mind if I come in? I believe you got something for me...
Lost.Season06.Episode09 BEN: Sun? Sun, can you hear me?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 BEN: What happened? You alright?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 그 사람 어디 있어요? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 BEN: I'm sorry, what?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 날 쫓아 왔는데... 그 사람... 분명히 왔어요. 그 사람... 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 BEN: Slow down. Tell me what happened in English. Who did this to you?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Sayid! Sayid, hey! What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAYID: We were attacked.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: By whom?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAYID: I don't know.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Where is Jin?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: Hey! Hey!
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: Well... that was weird, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: Where am I?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: It's called Room 23. The DHARMA Initiative was doing experiments on subliminal messaging in here. But... you know all about the DHARMA Initiative... don't you, Mr. Kwon?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: Why did you bring me here?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: Relax. You're safe.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: I'm leaving.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: Sorry, but we went to a lot of trouble getting you here off of the other island. And I can't let you leave.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: What do you want from me?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: These are grid maps that the...the DHARMA people used to identify pockets of electromagnetism. Whoever signed these could really help me out. I know... I know the writing's diffcult to read but... but sure looks like it says Jin Soo-Kwon. So, is it you or isn't it?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: You want answers to your questions? Then get me your boss. I want to talk with Charles Widmore.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: Well... then you're in luck, Mr. Kwon. Because he'd like to talk to you too.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: You a good swimmer?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAYID: Good enough.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Wrap this in plastic, you don't want it to get wet. We're taking the outrigger.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Something wrong, Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 CLAIRE: Um... what, what you said to Jin... about the names on the wall? Told him you needed them all to get off the island?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Yes I did.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 CLAIRE: So... was my name on the wall?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 CLAIRE: Then... it doesn't matter if I get on that plane then. I mean you don't, you don't need me--
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: No. That's not true, Claire. I need you.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: And there's plenty of room on that plane for all of us.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 CLAIRE: Now when we go home, Aaron's not going to know me. Stranger to my own son. He thinks Kate's his mother. Was her name on the wall?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: No, Claire... it isn't. Not anymore. But I need Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 CLAIRE: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Because I'm three people shy of getting off this island and Kate can help me get these people on that plane. But... once she does... then whatever happens, happens.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: What's up with the guns? You two goin' somewhere?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: We're taking a boat ride over to the other island.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: What do you need a boat for? Can't you just turn into smoke and fly your ass over the water?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Do you think if I could do that I would still be on this island?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: No, 'cause that would be ridiculous... what the hell are you goin' over there for anyway? Thought you were tryin' to avoid Charlie Widmore.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: They took one of our people, James. So I'm going to get him back.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Is this for me? Wow this is really nice. Hmm. Your bodyguard is supposed to give me some money. Where's Mr. Kwon?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: No English.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Sit down.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 OMAR: I checked his room, he's not there.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Check the bathroom.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 OMAR: Come on, let's go.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Mr. Kwon! Why don't you come and join us? Look, thank you for the watch, okay, but you're also supposed to give me an envelope with money in it. Twenty-five thousand dollars. Yeah?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 그럼 어떻게 해? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 우리 돈을 좀 주면 안될까? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 놈한테 돈을 주자고? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY:  Stop it. I feel like I'm in a damn Godzilla movie. What's that guy's name, the uhhh Russian guy, speaks like nine different languages, uhhh uhhh Danny's friend?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 OMAR: Mikhail.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Mikhail. He speak Korean?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 OMAR: Think so.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Go get him.  Now put your damn clothes on.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 그 돈은 세관에서 압류당했지만, 나한테 돈이 있어요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MIKHAIL: She says the money her father gave them was taken at customs.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: It's not my problem.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 같이 은행에 가면 내가 돈을 찾아줄게요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MIKHAIL: She wants you to let them please go to the bank, they will get it for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: You take her to the bank, I'll take Casanova here to the restaurant, then we'll meet there.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MIKHAIL: 진수는 나중에 보기로 하죠. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 저희... 두 사람에 대해서는 미스터 백께 비밀로 해주십시오. 부탁드립니다. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: What's he whining about?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MIKHAIL: He wants you to promise that you won't tell her father that they are involved.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Oh. Hey, don't worry about that. Okay, your secret, it's safe with me. Okay? Just bring me the money and then we could all live happily ever after, right?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 BEN: What? Oh, for the fourth time, I was gathering mangoes and she was already unconscious when I found her. Why won't you believe me?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ILANA: Because you're speaking.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: You got a pretty descent size bump, might be a slight concussion. You can understand what I'm saying?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: But you can only speak Korean.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 맞아요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MILES: She hits her head and forgets English? Are we supposed to buy that?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LAPIDUS: Asks the man who communes with the dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: It might be aphasia. It's um, a condition that's caused by trauma and it affects the language center of your brain. It's usually temporary. Sun, You're gonna be okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MILES: What are you smiling about?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 RICHARD: Pack your bags, we're leaving.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MEN: DON'T MOVE!!
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SEAMUS: Let me see your hands!
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE:  Easy, friend, I come in peace.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: Do you know who I am?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: Charles Widmore. Do you know who I am?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: Obviously you're not John Locke. Everything else I know is a combination of myth, ghost stories, and jungle noises in the night.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: I think you know more than that judging by these pylons.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: Why did you come here?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: You took one of my people, Jin Kwon.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: I have no idea what you're talking about.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: A wise man once said that war was coming to this Island, I think it just got here.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: Where exactly are we going, Richard?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 RICHARD: Where's Locke?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 BEN: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 RICHARD: You said he came to recruit you. Where did he say he'd be?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 BEN: Hydra island.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 RICHARD: Which is exactly where you landed the plane that you flew back here, right?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LAPIDUS: That's right.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 RICHARD: This man wants to leave the island, and that plane's the only way he can do it. You wanna know where we're going, we're gonna stop him.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MILES: This is your fault isn't it?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 HURLEY: Sorta.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ILANA: How are we gonna stop him from getting on the plane?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 RICHARD: We have to destroy it.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 뭐라고요? 비행기를 없애버린다고요? 그럼 이 섬에서 어떻게 탈출하려구요? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 RICHARD: Why isn't she speaking English?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: She was hit on the head when she was running away from Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 RICHARD: He came back here?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 RICHARD: What, what did he want? What did he say to you? Do you understand me?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 그래, 다 이해했어 이 바보야! 내가 널 도와서 이 섬을 빠져나갈 유일한 방법을 없앨거라고 생각한다면 넌 미쳐도 한참 미쳤어! 난 이 세상을 구하러 온게 아니라 내 남편을 다시 찾아서 다시 돌아가려고 여기 온거야. 내가 중요하다고 이 여자가 그랬어. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 만약에 사실이라면, 넌 내가 꼭 필요해! 하지만 이것만은 알아둬, 난 여기서 한발짝도 움직이지 않을거야! 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 HURLEY: I don't think she wants to come.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 무슨 문제라도 있어요? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MIKHAIL: Miss Paik would like to know if there is a problem.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 BANK CLERK: I'm sorry, I'm showing that your account was closed. The balance is zero.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MIKHAIL: 당신 계좌가 끊겼답니다. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 아니, 그럴 리가 없어요. 나 밖에는 이 계좌에 대해서 아무도 아는 사람이 없어요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MIKHAIL: If she may ask, who closed the account please?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 BANK CLERK: Looks like her father, Mr. Woo-Jung Paik had access. The funds were transferred to one of his other accounts at our main branch in Seoul.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MIKHAIL: 아버님께서 지시하셨습니다. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 왜? 뭐 때문에요? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MIKHAIL: 정말 몰라서 물어요? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 OMAR: Go on, get in.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: What's going on?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 OMAR: I bumped his head on the door.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Come on Omar, you gotta be more careful than that.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: I got this. You go get the Arab guy.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 OMAR: Hey...I'm an Arab.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Just go pick him up
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Sorry about that. Omar is loyal but he lacks attention to detail. You don't really understand a word I'm saying to you right now, do you? Nothing? Right. Just hold still okay. I'm gonna strap you in here just in case you figure out what's about to happen to you, I can't have you freaking out. I don't think you realise how unhappy Mr. Paik was when he found out that you were doing his little girl. That other twenty five that you were supposed to deliver, that was my fee for popping you. From what I hear, now anyone who works for Paik knows the cardinal rule - hands off the boss's daughter. But you, you couldn't resist her, could you? The heart wants what the heart wants.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: I'm sorry. Some people just aren't meant to be together.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: What the hell were you thinking?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: I'm sorry, I know, I know we panicked.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: This was not supposed to happen for days. We had a timetable.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: See, he was leaving their camp.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: Well you should have let him leave and taken him in the jungle.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: Well maybe you should put a mercenary in charge instead of a geophysicist.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: What's done is done. I need you to get the package from the submarine and take it to the infirmary. Can you do that for me please Zoe?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: Yeah. Sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: Mr Kwon, my deepest apologies for everything that's been done to you. My name is--
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: I know who you are. Why did you bring me here.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: We searched the Ajira plane, discovered your wife's luggage and found this inside. I thought you might want to have it. Go ahead, turn it on.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: Her name is Ji Yeon. Your daughter. I understand you've never seen her before. I have a daughter too. I know what it's like to be kept apart. I understand the one thing you want is to be reunited with your wife and daughter. But it would be short lived. If that thing masquerading as John Locke ever got off this island, your wife, your daughter, my daughter, everyone we know and love - would simply cease to be. I came here to make sure that doesn't happen.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: How?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: Come with me. I think it's time for you to see the package.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: What package?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 WIDMORE: It's not a what. It's a who.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 죽이지 말아주세요. 제발 살려주세요! 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAYID: Who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: No English.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAYID: I don't know why you're here and I don't really care.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: No! Free! Free! Free!
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAYID: Good luck.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MIKHAIL: Martin! Martin! Who did this to you?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KEAMY: Look behind you, you idiot.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 총 내려놔. 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MIKHAIL: 흥분하지 마. 알았어. 누가 이런거야? 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 버리라고 그랬지. 어서! 선, 저리 가. 귀 먹었어, 이 새끼야? 안 버리면 쏜다!  Do you hear me? Drop it or I'm going to kill you.]
Lost.Season06.Episode09 MIKHAIL: 그러진 못 할걸. 죽이려고 했다면 벌써 쐈겠지.  you would've shot me already.]
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JIN: 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SUN: 나 임신했어... 
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: Brought you a couple of things. Thinking about a patient that I had during my residency. Car crash, banged his head, when he woke up he couldn't talk. The guy was frustrated, I mean, who wouldn't be. Then one of the nurses said "just because he can't speak, doesn't mean that he can't write". Think you can give it a try?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: Take a little longer to get your point across, but at least you have your voice back. Went back out to your garden to see if he was there. He wasn't. I found this.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: That's one stubborn tomato. Guess no-one told it it was supposed to die.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: Don't worry about it. Not the first person to tell me to leave them alone.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: Locke - what did he say to you?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: Why didn't you go with him?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: You trust me?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 JACK: Sun, come with us and I'll help you find Jin. I'll help you find him and I'll get you both on that plane and as far away from this island as you can get. I promise.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: Where'd you go?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KATE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: Looked like your brain took a little stroll.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KATE: Why aren't you worried, James?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: I am worried. Just really good at pretending I ain't. But I got a feeling this is almost over. 'Cause if Locke rode over there on a boat with Sayid, then Charlie Widmore blew him right out of the water.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KATE: What if he didn't?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: Well then we're screwed six ways from sun--
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: Oh Hell.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 KATE: He's alone.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: Thought you went over there to find Jin?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: They said they didn't have him.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: And you believed that?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: Where's Sayid? You lose him too?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: When you were over there James, you mentioned that Widmore had someone guarding a room on his submarine. Guarding something that he didn't want you to see?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SAWYER: Yeah, so?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 LOCKE: I don't like secrets.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SEAMUS: The guy can hardly stand.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: Well what do you expect?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SEAMUS: How much did you give him?
Lost.Season06.Episode09 ZOE: Obviously I gave him too much but we needed him knocked out for the trip. I'm not a nurse. Come on, get him up.
Lost.Season06.Episode09 SEAMUS: Let's go Mr. Hume.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: Mr. Hume, my name is Zoe. I know you're disoriented, you've been unconscious for the last three days. But you're off the I.V. sedation now, and I've just given you a shot to help you wake up.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Are you a nurse?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: You're not in the hospital anymore Mr. Hume, we had to move you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: What, move me? Move me where? Where's my wife?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: No, wait Mr.-Mr.-No, you shouldn't, you shouldn't--
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I want to see Penny.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: I'm afraid that's not going to be possible, Desmond.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND:  You.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Easy, Easy. I'll take it from here.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Desmond--
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: What happened to me? Where am I?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: You were shot. By Benjamin Linus. Do you remember that?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Yes, I remember. Look I want to talk to Penny. Penny!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: She's not here. But I assure you both she and your son are perfectly safe. I'm really sorry for taking you away from them but...I didn't have a chance to explain. And...if I had, you never would've come with me.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Come with you? Come with you where?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: I brought you back to the Island. I can't imagine how you must be feeling. But if you'll give me a chance to explain--
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Damn it! Don't hurt him.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: You take me back! You take me back right now, you hear?!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: I can't take you back. The Island isn't done with you yet.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 JIN: What is Desmond doing here?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: It would be easier for me to show you, than to tell you, Mr. Kwon.  Take him with you to the generator room. I'll be along with Hume so we can start the test.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: Charles, th-that test isn't scheduled until tomorrow.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: I know when it's scheduled. Get them ready now.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: Come on, no time for sightseeing.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: They're bringing Hume down now.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SEAMUS: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: You heard me, we are go right now. What's your timeframe?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SEAMUS: We're not even close to being ready! This generator probably hasn't run in twenty years. How am I supposed--
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: Widmore doesn't want to wait.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 JIN: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: We're running a little test.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 JIN: What kind of test?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SEAMUS: Alright let's see where we are. Can we get a functioning E.M. field going, people?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 UNKNOWN VOICE: Sure thing.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SEAMUS: Then try a power test. Generator to full, please.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 UNKNOWN VOICE: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SEAMUS: Here we go. On my count... three...two...one...and power on.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SEAMUS: Great. We've probably got a faulty contact somewhere, find it! Simmons, go down and check the circuits on the solenoids.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SIMMONS: Yes sir.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SEAMUS:  And guess what, Angstrom, you're going in there next.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 UNKNOWN TECHNICIAN: Found it! It was a bad breaker on the genny. Bringing it back online now.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: No!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: No!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SEAMUS: Turn it off, turn it off!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: Oh my god.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Zoe. Are we ready?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 MAN: Got it.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Stop.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: You can take him now. Thank you.  Put him inside.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Hey. What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: I know how this looks, Desmond. But if everything I've been told about you is true, you'll be perfectly fine.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE'S MAN: You don't have any metal on you do you? Keys? Change?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Course he doesn't, you idiot. I hate to resort to forcing this upon you, Desmond. But once it's over I'm going to ask you to make a sacrifice. And I hope for all our sakes you'll help me.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Sacrifice? What the bloody Hell do you know about sacrifice?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: My son died here for the sake of this island. Your wife - my own daughter - hates me. And I've never even met my grandson. But if you won't help me, Desmond, all of it will be for nothing. Penny, your son, and everyone else, will be gone forever.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Aah! Uhh! Aah!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: All right, turn it on.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 JIN: No! If you want me to help you with whatever you're doing here, you need to explain to me--
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: That man is the only person I'm aware of, in the world, who has survived a catastrophic electromagnetic event, I need to know that he can do it again, or we all die. Turn it on!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Do we have full power?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SEAMUS: Yeah, but...
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Let me out!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Let me out you bastards! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! 
Lost.Season06.Episode10 HURLEY: It's carousel four.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Sorry?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 HURLEY: You were on the Sydney flight, right?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 HURLEY: Our bags on carousel four, I double checked it with the dude at the counter.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Hang on, I got it, I got it.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CLAIRE: Thank you so much.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Pleasure. You got any more bags?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CLAIRE: No uhhh, that's it, thank God.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Boy or a girl?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CLAIRE: Ummm.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Oh I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to pry.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CLAIRE: Oh no it's fine, I just ummm, I don't know what it is.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: All right. Well you're braver than I, you know. I'm not a big fan of surprises.  Oh excuse me, that's mine.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: So, have you got someone meeting you?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CLAIRE: Uhh yeah, uh maybe they got the flights messed up or something.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Because I've got a car picking me up. You now, If you need a ride I'd be more than happy to give you a lift.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CLAIRE: Oh no, no, that's ummm, that's really sweet of you but I'm good, there's cabs, so...
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: All right, well, it was nice meeting you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CLAIRE: Yeah nice to meet you too.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: A boy.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CLAIRE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Bet it's a boy.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Looks like I'm with you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: Mr. Hume, hello. Let me grab that for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: My name is George.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Hi, George.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: So, I'll take you back to your hotel?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: The office.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: Office. Wonderful. This way please. So uh, you flew in from Sydney huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Yeah, that's right.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: And what, what were you doing uh down under?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I was closing a deal for the boss.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: Oh good for you, congratulations. Hey listen, if you need anything at all while you're in town, I know everyone. You need a reservation? You just pick a restaurant.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: The room service at the hotel's excellent, thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: You uhh, you looking uh for some company? I noticed that you weren't wearing a wedding band. And there are a lot of lovely ladies offering their uh companionship.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I'm not looking for any companionship. I'm here to work.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: Guess that's why you're the boss's right-hand man, and I am the driver. Okay. Got it.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 RECEPTIONIST: Good morning Mr. Hume, how was your flight?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Lovely, thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 RECEPTIONIST: He said to send you right in.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Charles.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Hello, Desmond. Welcome to Los Angeles, my friend.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE : I don't give a bloody damn what he did, or how much it's going to cost. Just get him arraigned and get him out of there.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Sorry Desmond. Looks like our celebration of the Australian deal is going to have to be cut short. You are aware that my son is a musician?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Yes. I've heard he's quite talented.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Yeah he is, quite. Anyway, my wife is putting together one of her charity events and uh, the boy had the crazy idea to combine classical music with modern rock. You heard of a band called Drive Shaft?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: No, can't say I have.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Their bass guitarist overdosed and uh, got himself arrested. And now, if I don't get this junkie to my wife's event she will, simply put, destroy me.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: So you want me to babysit him?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: I know it's beneath you, but I need someone I can trust to do the job right.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Say no more Charles, it's done.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Huh.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: You really do have the life, son. No family, no commitments, ahh to be free of attachments.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I'm a blessed man, Sir.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: No, it is I who am blessed, to have you in my employ. A drink, to celebrate your indispensibility.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: That's your sixty-year-old Scotch, Charles.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Nothing's too good for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Slàinte.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 LAWYER: Mr. Hume?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: That's right.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 LAWYER: Bail's all been taken care of. Remember he's not allowed to leave the state.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Good. Mr. Pace, I'm Desmond Hume. Charles Widmore sent me.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND:  Hey! Where you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 LAWYER: He's all yours.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Hey!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DRIVER: What's wrong with you?! Idiot!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND:  I'll have whatever he's having.  One drink, then we go.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: So what's your job then, to babysit me? What are you? Mr. Widmore's chief lackey? Henchman?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: No title. Plenty of perks though.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: Hmmm, such as?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I get to meet charming people.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: Well, cheers then. Tell me perky, are you happy?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Quite.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: No you're not.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Well, I've got a great job, lots of money, get to travel the world. Why wouldn't I be happy?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: Have you ever been in love?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Thousands of times.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about spectacular, consciousness-altering love. Do you know what that looks like?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I wasn't aware that love looked like anything.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: I've seen it, mate. On the plane back from Sydney.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Is that so? Well we were on the same flight, so...maybe I saw it too.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: Trust me, you didn't.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Oh? Enlighten me.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: There was this woman, two rows in front of me, in handcuffs, sitting with a cop. He looked at me, knew I was holding. If I didn't take action I'd be caught. So I got up, went to the lav, proceeded to eliminate the evidence by swallowing my stash. And at that exact moment we hit turbulence. I choked. The entire bag of heroin is stuck in my throat. It's, uh, it's over. Everything starts to go dark, I'm slipping into the abyss, and then I see...her.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Her?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: A woman. Blonde, rapturously beautiful, and I know her. We're together. It's like we've always been, and always will be. This feeling, this love, and just as I'm about to be engulfed by...(snaps fingers) I open my eyes, and this sodding idiot is standing there asking me if I'm okay. But I saw it, just for a moment, I saw what it looked like.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Well that's just...poetry, brother. You know you should, you should write a song about that.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: Yeah yeah yeah yeah, I know what you're saying - poor suicidal rock star. But I've seen something real, I've seen the truth.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: No, that's not the truth. You want to know the real truth, Pace? Right now you have a choice - you can keep on drinking, or you can come with me. Now before you make your choice, realize that if you stay here, it will very likely result in the extermination of your musical career.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: And if I go with you?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: In twenty minutes, you'll be luxuriating in a five-star hotel, right on the harbor front, and Charles Widmore - one of the most powerful men in this town, will owe you a favor.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: Doesn't really seem like a choice.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: There's always a choice, brother.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: That's my band, Drive Shaft, our first single. The beginning of everything great. You like it?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Sure, for what it is.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: I feel sorry for you, mate.  You think you're happy. You think you've got it all--this, your life. But, you don't.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Why, because none of it's real?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: All right, Mr. Hume. How about I offer you a choice?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: What's that?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: I can either show you what I'm talking about, or you can get out of the car. 
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Why in God's name would I want to get out of the car?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Aah! Uhh!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND:  Charlie! Charlie!  Come on!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND:  Come on! Come on! Damn it!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DOCTOR: You sustained a pretty bad bump in your accident. Any nausea?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Nope.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DOCTOR: Double vision?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: No. Listen, I need to find the man I was brought in here with.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DOCTOR: How about hallucinations?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: What do you mean?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DOCTOR: Hallucinations. Seeing things that aren't there.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND : Um, I'm not sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DOCTOR: Well, your C.A.T. scan was inconclusive. I'm going to send you downstairs for an M.R.I.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: No, I don't have time for this. I need to find the man I came in here with.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DOCTOR: I'm afraid you're not finding anyone until we know what's going on inside your brain.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 TECHNICIAN: Are you wearing any metal?  Carrying keys or change? Any metal inside your body--pacemakers, pins, bullets, steel plate inside of your head?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: No. Nothing.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 TECHNICIAN: I see you didn't list an emergency contact, no friends or family?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Um, just put down my employer, Charles Widmore.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 TECHNICIAN: This machine is super loud. You're gonna want these.  And you need the button.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: The button?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 TECHNICIAN: The panic button. You need to stop, press it. Try not to 'cause we'll have to start all over again from the beginning. I'll be in that booth over there. You'll be able to hear me. Thirty minutes, okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 TEHCNICIAN: Okay, here we go.
Lost.Season06.Episode10  Desmond.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Hey! Let me out of here.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Hey! Hey!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 TECHNICIAN:  What happened, man? Are you all right?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I need to find the man I came in here with.  I need to find the man I came in here with.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: His name is Charlie Pace. He came in an hour ago. He just give me his room number.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 NURSE: If you're not a relative, that's confidential information.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Look, we were in an accident together. I need to see him!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 NURSE: Sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Hey. Excuse me. Um, were you on the same Oceanic flight um, from Sydney.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 JACK: Yeah, yeah, you were sitting next to me. Desmond, right?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Yeah, that's right. Listen. I wonder if you can help me, brother. I need to find someone. He was on our plane. He's somewhere in the hospital.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 JACK: Hold on. He was on our plane and now he's here in the hospital?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: None of this matters. None of this matters.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WOMAN: No! Sir! Please, stop!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 JACK: Take it easy.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Why are you running?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: Cause no one here can help me. Now let me go.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Why'd you try and to kill me?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: I didn't try and kill you. I was trying to show you something.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Want to show me something? Show me your hand.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Your hands. Show me your bloody hands now.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: You saw something, didn't you? In the water. What was it?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: What are you looking for, mate?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Who's Penny?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: I don't know. Ah. You felt it, didn't you?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I didn't feel anything.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: Then, why are you accosting a man in a dressing gown?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: All right. Come on. We're leaving.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: Whoa! You think I'm going to play a rock concert after this? This doesn't matter. None of this matters. All that matters is that we felt it. You wanna try and stop me, good luck.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Hey, where you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 CHARLIE: If I were you I'd stop worrying about me and start looking for Penny.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: What do you mean he's gone?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Look he escaped. He knocked over a doctor with a bloody crash cart and then ran out of the hospital.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: And you let him go?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: He's a junkie who drove my car into the ocean, Charles. I'm fine, by the way. Thanks for asking.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: And I'm thrilled you survived, Desmond. But when I give you a job to do, I expect you to do it.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: With all due respect, sir, it's just a bloody concert.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: I tell you what, Desmond, if you can't deliver Pace, why don't you tell Mrs. Widmore, it's only a bloody concert.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: Mr. Hume. So you’ve never met the boss' wife, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: Good luck.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Please, tell me, how is it that someone in your line of work is not aware that the butter knife is placed handle to the right, blade facing left? Just so.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WAITER: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: For God's sake.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Mrs. Widmore?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Yes!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: My name is Desmond Hume. I work for your husband.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Of course, Mr. Hume. Charles has told me so much about you. It's a travesty we haven't met before... Well, it's about time.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Well, the feeling is mutual, Mrs. Widmore.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Oh, please. It's Eloise.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Eloise.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: So uhh, what crisis forced Charles to send his best fix-it man into the bowels of charity balls?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Well, Eloise, uh, I'm deeply sorry but it appears as if, uh, Drive Shaft won't be able to perform alongside your son. And, uh, I take full responsibility--
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Don't worry about it.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Oh, my son will understand. I suppose if one employs so-called rock stars, certain unpredictability comes with the territory.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Yeah. You're not angry?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Oh, not at all dear. What happened, happened. Thank you so much, Mr. Hume, for coming and telling me in person. A pleasure meeting you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: And you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE:  Uh, center that flower arrangement, please.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Have a good evening.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Thank you!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 MAN: Leifer, Stefanie, plus two. Markey, Mary, plus one. Milton, Penny solo. Pepper, Nicholas, plus one.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Excuse me. I'm sorry, um, did you just say Penny?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 MAN: And who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Um, I work for Mr. Widmore, may I see the list?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: You absolutely may not. That list is confidential.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Begging your pardon, I'm entrusted with confidential items every day.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Are you questioning me?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: No, I just want to look at one name on that list. And, if for some reason, that's a problem...
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Come with me.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE:  Out! Everyone, now!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Look, I'm, I'm sorry, if I've overstepped my bounds.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Stop talking, Hume. I've heard what you've had to say, now you listen to me. I want you to stop.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Stop? Stop what?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Someone has clearly affected the way you see things. This is a serious problem. It is, in fact, a violation. So, whatever you're doing, whatever it is you think you're looking for...You need to stop looking for it.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Do you, do you know what I'm looking for, Mrs. Widmore?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: I don't know why you're looking for anything? You have the perfect life.  On top of it, you’ve managed to attain the thing you wanted more than anything--my husband's approval.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: How do you know what I want?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: Because I bloody do.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I need to see that list...or you need to tell me why I can't.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ELOISE: You can't because you're not ready yet, Desmond.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Ready? Ready, for what?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: That bad, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Is there any alcohol in this car?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: Oh, yeah. Whatever you need. So, uh, where to, Mr. Hume?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Just drive, George.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DANIEL: Mr. Hume?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Yes?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DANIEL: My name is Daniel, Daniel Widmore. We need to talk.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Look, uh, Mr. Widmore, um...
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DANIEL: Dan, please. Call me, Dan. Mr. Widmore is my father.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Dan, if this is about Charlie Pace not being able to perform with you, I'm, I'm very sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DANIEL: Do you believe in love at first sight, Mr. Hume?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DANIEL: First time I saw her was walking through this museum, few weeks ago. She, she works here. She was on her lunch break. She was eating a chocolate bar. She has these incredible blue, blue eyes, red hair. And, as soon as I saw her, right, right in that moment, it was like, it was like I already loved her. And that's when things got weird.  That same night after I saw that woman, I woke up and I wrote this.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: So what is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DANIEL: I'm a musician. I have no idea. So I took it to a friend of mine at Caltech. He's a math whiz. He said this is quantum mechanics. He said these equations are so advanced that only someone who'd been studying physics their entire life could have come up with them.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: So what do they mean?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DANIEL: Okay. Imagine, imagine something terrible is about to happen. Something catastrophic, and the only way to stop it from happening is by releasing a huge amount of energy. Like setting off a nuclear bomb.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: You wanna set off a nuclear bomb.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DANIEL: Just listen, what if, this, all this, what if this wasn't suppose to be our life? What if we had some other life and for some reason, we changed things? I don't want to set off a nuclear bomb, Mr. Hume. I think I already did.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Listen, mate, um. I don't know what any of this has to do with me, so...
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DANIEL: Why did you ask my mother about a woman named Penny? It happened to you, too, didn't it? You felt it.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I don't know...I don't know what I felt.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DANIEL: Yes, you do. You felt love.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: That's impossible, because I don't know anything about this woman, I don't know...I don't know where she is. I don't even know if she exists. She's...she's an idea.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DANIEL: No, Mr. Hume. She's my half-sister. And I can tell you exactly where and when you can find her.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 PENNY:  Hi.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Excuse me.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 PENNY: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Are you Penny?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 PENNY: Uh, yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Hello, I’m Desmond.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 PENNY:  Uh, Hi.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 MAN: Checking in now.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SEAMUS: He's okay!
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Indeed he is! How are you, Desmond? How are you feeling?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Fine. How long was I unconscious for?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Oh, no more than a few seconds.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Will you help me up, please.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: I'm really sorry we had to do this to you, Desmond. But, as I told you, your talent is vital to our mission. So, if you just let me explain...
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: It's all right. I understand.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I said, I understand.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: You told me you brought me here to the island to do something very important.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 WIDMORE: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: When do we start?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: What happened to you?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: What do you mean?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: What I mean is, twenty minutes ago you were beating the crap out of Widmore with an I.V. stand and, and now you’re Mr. Cooperative.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: A lot can happen in twenty minutes.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: Sure can. That thing fried your brain.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Did it?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 ZOE: Whatever, doesn’t change that we're gonna...
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SAYID:  Run.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 SAYID: Desmond, I don't have time to explain, but these people are extremely dangerous. We need to go now.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Aye, of course. Lead the way.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 PENNY: Hello? You okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 PENNY: Well, I shook your hand and then you fainted. I must have quite an effect on you.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Aye, aye you must have.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 PENNY: Have we met before?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I-I think we'd have remembered it, if we had.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 PENNY: Yeah. Well, as long as you're sure you're all right.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, listen, um, would you like to go for a coffee?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 PENNY: What, now? I'm a sweaty mess.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I just fainted in front of you. I'd say we're even.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 PENNY: There's a coffee shop on the corner of Sweetzer and Melrose. I'll meet you there in an hour.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Absolutely.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 PENNY: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: So, did you find what you were looking for?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Yes, George, I did. Corner of Melrose and Sweetzer, please.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: You got it. And if there is anything else I can do for you, Mr. Hume, you just name it.
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: Actually, there is one thing, George. Can you get me the manifest for my flight from Sydney, Oceanic 815, just the names of the passengers?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 GEORGE: Sure I can. Do you mind if I ask you what you need it for?
Lost.Season06.Episode10 DESMOND: I just need to show them something...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CHANG: In a world of conflict and strife, there is but one fact we all can agree upon... everybody loves Hugo.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CHANG: Born to humble surroundings, Hugo Reyes has always been a beacon of light for all who cross his path.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CHANG: Hugo's lifelong love affair with chicken led him to acquire and then expand the Mr. Cluck's chain into a worldwide phenomenon.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CHANG: The exponential growth of Hugo's success was startling. But financial success wasn't the end. It was the beginning. Hugo and giving became synonymous.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CHANG: Parks, playgrounds, hospitals, the Mr. Cluck's House for Children... the philanthropy was unparalleled.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CHANG: Which brings us to this evening and the opening of the Hugo Reyes Palentology Wing at the Golden State Natural History Museum. A lasting beacon of culture that bears the name of one of our city's greatest benefactors.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CHANG: Ladies and gentlemen, our man of the year... Hugo Reyes!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Pretty cool trophy, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CARMEN: Mmm hmm, Hugo...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Oh, you know we got the Human Fund next Saturday night... can you make it?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CARMEN: Another trophy... everybody loves Hugo... you know who doesn't? Women.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Ma!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CARMEN: You need a woman in your life. Especially one who has not nursed you.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: That's disgusting. And I'm too busy to meet someone...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CARMEN: You're not too busy. You're too scared!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I'm not scared!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CARMEN: Good, because you have a date tomorrow.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I do?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CARMEN: Grandpa Tito's neighbor's daughter. Rosalita. She agreed to lunch with you.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: What's she like?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CARMEN: Willing to meet you.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Ma--
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CARMEN: You're going! She's gonna love you! And if she doesn't... we will find someone who does!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: A lot of crazy stuff's been happening... I kind of wish I could talk to you about it in person. A lot of people come to talk to me after they've... you know... gone. It would be nice if you did too.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: Hugo!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: You ready to go? Once I'm back, we're leaving.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Where are you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: The Black Rock. If we're going to destroy that plane, we'll need dynamite.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: You sure that's the right move?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: No. But it's the only move we have.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Well... you're the expert.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: Whose grave is this?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Her name was Libby. She was in the tail section of the plane. We were gonna have our first date. It was gonna be, like... a picnic. But then she was murdered.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Yeah, me too...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MICHAEL: Hey!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MICHAEL: I'm here to stop you from getting everyone killed.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MICHAEL: You gonna say something?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Why should I trust you? You murdered Libby and Ana Lucia.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MICHAEL: That doesn't matter right now. What matters is you going across that island to blow up that plane. People are gonna die. A lot of people, and it's gonna be your fault.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MICHAEL: Because people are listening to you now, Hurley.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Hurley!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Who are you talking to?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Um... no one.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Come on. We're leaving.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 WAITER: Can I get you some more homemade tortilla chips?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Sure. Whatever...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Uh... can you leave those? I'm meeting someone. She's running late.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 WAITER: Right. Chips are on the way.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: Hugo?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Uh... hi. Nice to meet you.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Wow! Uh... I wasn't expecting someone like you.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: Uh... I'm sorry?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: You know, someone so... pretty. Please, have a seat.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: You don't look like a Rosalita...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: Oh, uh... my name isn't Rosalita. It's Libby.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: So... you're not my blind date?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: No, I... I just saw you from across the room.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Well... how did you know my name?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: Well, if I tell you, you're gonna think I'm crazy.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: No I won't.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: Hugo, do you believe that two people can be connected? Like soulmates?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I guess...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: You don't remember me, do you?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Should I?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DR. BROOKS: What are you doing, Elizabeth? Are you bothering this man?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: No! No, he... he's an old friend.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Actually, we just... wait, what? What's going on?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DR. BROOKS: I apologize for the intrusion.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DR. BROOKS: Come on.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: No, Dr. Brooks, if I could just--
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Doctor?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DR. BROOKS: I'm sorry, she just wandered off.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Wandered off from where?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: Everything that I said, Hugo... I meant it.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DR. BROOKS: Forgive us.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: Alright, let's go. We have to make it to the outriggers and across the channel to Hydra Island before nightfall.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Do you have the dynamite?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: Four sticks. Enough to destroy the cockpit and all the instruments. That plane'll never fly.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Um... I don't know if that's a good idea. I mean, for one thing, that stuff's really unstable.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: You have to trust me. I've been training my whole life for this.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: To blow stuff up?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: To protect you!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Yeah, but how's blowing up the plane protecting us?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: With that plane gone, that thing won't be able to leave the island.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Yeah... well neither will we. And then we'll be stuck here with it and it will be angry at us.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: Jacob said Richard will know what to do. And Richard said to blow up the plane, correct?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Well, Jacob never said anything about it to me. I mean... what if Richard's wrong?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 ILANA: Hugo, I'm looking out for your best interests! All of you! Nothing is more important than this! That thing is evil! And God help us if it ever leaves this island! Because if it--
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MAN : ...about six feet off the ground.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAWYER: That gonna be a spear?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm not sure what it's gonna be yet, James. When the time is right, it'll tell me.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAWYER: You talk to wood now?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 KATE: Sawyer...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Something I can do for you two?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAWYER: Is there something you can do? How about anything? Those bastards on the other island grabbed Jin and we're just sittin' here twiddlin' our damn thumbs, doin' nothin' about it!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: There's a difference between doing nothing and waiting.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 KATE: So what are we waiting for?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: You were only able to come back to this island because you all did it together. If we're gonna get on that plane and leave, it has to happen the same way. We're waiting for your friends to get here, Kate. Hugo... Sun... Jack. That's the only way we're ever getting off this... Godforsaken rock.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 KATE: Well, I don't see that happening.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Well, let's just hope you're wrong.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAWYER: Where have you been?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAYID: Can I speak to you in private?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Absolutely.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Everything go alright?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAYID: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Did Widmore see you?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAYID: No, but his people did.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: And you let them live?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAYID: I didn't see the point of killing them when I had what I came for.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: So you found what they were hiding in the submarine?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAYID: I most certainly did.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 BEN: Now what?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: We get more dynamite. Or else she died for nothing.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Maybe she died to show us to stay the hell away from dynamite.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Well Jack, that's a risk I'm willing to take.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Richard, I promised Sun that I'd get her off this island.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Well Jack, I... I wish you hadn't done that. If it makes you feel any better, you can blame it on me.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I think Richard's right. It's the only choice we've got. Trust me, Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Good. Let's get moving.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CASHIER: 38! Number 38!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CASHIER: Mr. Reyes! What an honor!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Give me a bucket. Family size.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CASHIER: Of course. Right away, sir.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 WOMAN: 41! Number 41!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: I'm sorry. Have I seen you before?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I own the place. Maybe you saw my commercial. You want a Cluckateer key chain?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: No, it's not that. Were you on Oceanic flight 815? About a week ago... from Sydney.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Uh... yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: So was I.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Wow, what a coincidence...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Listen, you mind if I join you while I wait for my order?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Be my guest...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Ooh... that is a lot of chicken!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I eat when I'm depressed!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Ah! So what's her name?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I met a girl on a blind date the other night.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: And you didn't... it didn't go how you hoped?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Mmm, she's totally awesome... except for one thing. She's crazy!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Well, all women are a little bit crazy, brother...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: No, this one actually lives in the loony bin. I mean, I saw the van. She's full on nuts. I mean, she started sane... but then, she told me that we already knew each other. And that, I'd remember!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Tell me something...did you believe her when she said she knew you?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Yeah. Kinda...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Now, I say go with your gut. You know, maybe you should... you should try to find out where she thinks she knew you from before you give up on her.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 CASHIER: 42! Order 42!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Ah! That's me, brother. Well, uh... it was nice bumpin' into ya.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Hello.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Hello.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: I'm sorry Sayid tied you up but he was afraid you would run before we had a chance to talk.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: I don't blame him. Although, as I explained to him before he left... I have nowhere to run to, brother.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Well, if that's not the best argument against captivity that I've ever heard, I don't know what is.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Would you mind if I asked you a couple of questions, Desmond?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Not at all.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Why did Charles Widmore bring you back to the island?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Considering I was kidnapped, you'd have to ask him.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAYID: They had him under armed guard.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: He threw me into a wood shack and blasted me with a massive amount of electromagnetism.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: If you don't mind my asking, Desmond... how could you be sure what it was that he blasted you with?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Experience.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Do you know who I am?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Of course. You're John Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Head back to camp. I'll be back soon.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAYID: Where are you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Desmond and I need to take a walk.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: There's something I'd like to show you.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 BEN: Kinda makes you think, doesn't it?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: What's that?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 BEN: Ilana. There she was - handpicked by Jacob, trained to come and protect you candidates, no sooner does she tell you who you are, then she blows up. The Island was done with her. Makes me wonder what's gonna happen when it's done with us.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: All right everyone, this might take a few minutes. I don't want anyone but me handling that dynamite, so I'm gonna go it alone. Where's Hugo?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: I thought he was up front with you
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY : Run! Run! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Why the hell did you do that?!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I'm protecting us.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: What the hell were you thinking?!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Calm down.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Now what-what are we supposed to do now?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: That's it. That's enough.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: We're dead. We're all dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MILES: A warning might have been nice there, Hugo.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I did say "Run."
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MILES: Why'd you do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Michael told me to.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MILES: Who?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Michael. He's one of the people who come back and yell at me after they die. He told me I had to stop everyone from blowing up the plane. So...no dynamite, no more blowing up.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MILES: That happen a lot? Dead people yelling at you?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: It happens enough.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MILES: And you just listen to whatever they say?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Dead people are more reliable than alive people.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DR. BROOKS: How can I help you, Mr. Reyes?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Want to ask you about that girl the other day. Libby? I was wondering if maybe I could see her.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DR. BROOKS: I don't think that's a good idea. She's not well.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Clearly, she's well enough for, like, a fajita field trip.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DR. BROOKS: Well, that's my mistake. I misjudged her condition.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Her condition?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DR. BROOKS: She has issues with reality.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: What do you mean?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DR. BROOKS: I just think it probably wouldn't be a good idea for you to see her right now. It'll only confuse her.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: You said "probably", which means you might make an exception.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DR. BROOKS: Well, perhaps for family.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Or a generous donor?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DR. BROOKS: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY : The rec room looked pretty gnarly on my way in. What do you think 100K might buy?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: You remembered?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: No. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: Then why are you here?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Where is it you think you know me from?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: Um, I'm not sure. I...I know it won't make sense.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Try me.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: A few days ago, I was watching TV, and one of your commercials came on. And the moment that I saw you, it was like I was hit over the hand. All these memories came washing back...of my life...only...it was...another life.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: What kind of memories?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: There was a plane crash...and uh...I was on an island.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: And I was there?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: Think so. We...knew each other. We...liked each other. And then when I got here, it was almost like I'd been here before. And for some reason, Hugo, I have a memory of you being here, too.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Um... This is the first time I've ever been in a mental hospital.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: Yeah, I know. But I can't get you out of my brain. That's why the other night when I saw you, I had to talk to you, because if you remembered me...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I wish I could, Libby. But...I can't. I'm sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: It's okay. It's okay. I'm crazy.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Yeah, probably, but...we all got something, right? I mean, it takes a lot of guts to go up to a total stranger and tell them you know them from some bizarro alternate universe. I'm scared just saying "hi" to a girl.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: You're doing fine.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Hey, can you ever like, like...get outta here? On day pass or...
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: Yeah, I'm here voluntarily.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Well...would you like to do something?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: You mean...a date?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Uh...yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: I'd love that.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Remind me, Desmond - how long were you down in that hatch, pushing that button?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Three years.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: And here you are, back for more. If I didn't know better, I'd say this island has it in for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Do you know better?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Well, there's nothing special about me, brother. This island has it in for all of us.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Yes, it does.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND : What?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Who's that?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Just ignore him.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Do you know that boy?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: I said ignore him!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Where you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Ben, back at the DHARMA barracks - there's still grenades there? Explosives?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 BEN: Yes, I think so.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Then that's where we're going.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Maybe we should talk about this a minute.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Talk? There's no time to talk, but if you know what we need to do, if you know how we stop that thing from leaving the Island without blowing that plane up, then let's hear it. Let's all hear it.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I know what we need to do.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Really? What's that?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: We have to go talk to Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 BEN: Are you trying to get us killed?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: It's not my idea. It's his.  Jacob says we have to talk to Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Jacob's here right now?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Ask him what the island is.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: A while back, Jacob told me what the Island was, and if he's really standing here right next to me, then just ask him.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I don't have to prove anything to you, Richard. You either come with me or you can keep trying to blow stuff up. Your call, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: He's lying. Jacob isn't telling us what to do. Because Jacob never tells us what to do. I'm going to make this simple. If that thing leaves the island, that's it. I-it's over.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MILES: What's over?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Everything. I'm destroying that plane and I can use all the help I can get. Who's coming with me?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 BEN: I am.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MILES: I saw that thing in action, man. It doesn't want to talk. Sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Anyone else?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Sorry, Richard. If Jacob says we go talk to Locke, we go talk to Locke. I'm going with Hugo.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Really?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 RICHARD: Don't get in our way.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: All right, Hurley. Let's go talk to Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LAPIDUS: Probably.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: So what do you think we should...say to Locke when we get there? I mean, how do you break the ice with a smoke monster?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: I wouldn't worry about it. Something tells me he's going to do most of the talking.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Or he could just kill us all.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Yeah. He could.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I didn't see Jacob back there. I just said it because I wanted everyone to listen to me.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: I know.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Then why'd you come with me?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Ever since Juliet died - ever since I got her killed - all I've wanted was to fix it. But I can't. I can't ever fix it. You've no idea how hard it is for me to sit back and listen to other people tell me what I should do...but I think maybe that's the point...maybe I'm supposed to let go.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Unless you letting go gets us killed. Going to see Locke was my idea, not Jacob's.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 JACK: Hurley, you asked me to trust you. This is me trusting you.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: It's a good thing you do, dude, because I have no idea where I'm going.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Wait. It's cool, I think I know what these things are.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LAPIDUS: Oh yeah? What the hell are they?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Wait here.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Hey, you around? Michael?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: You're stuck on the Island aren't you?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MICHAEL:  'Cause of what I did.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: And...there're others out here like you, aren't there? That's what the whispers are?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MICHAEL: Yeah. We're the ones who can't move on.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Do you know where Locke is?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MICHAEL: There.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Thanks. Is...is there anything I can do to...help you?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MICHAEL: Don't get yourself killed.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 MICHAEL: And Hurley, if you ever do see Libby again, tell her I'm very sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I'll be sure and do that, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I got like, six different kinds of cheeses. I don't even know what they are, but the lady at the store said they were good, so...figured you'd like cheese because...everybody likes cheese.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Something wrong?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: No, not wrong, just...off.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Have you been here before?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: No. It's just being here with you...feels so familiar. It's like a date we never had. Wow I sound completely insane, don't I?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: No...not completely.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: Why do you even want to be with me?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Why do you want to be with me?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: C'mon. Look at me.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: I wanna be with you because I like you.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Yeah but, you like me because...well...you're...delusional.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: What? What's wrong?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Whoa, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I...I think I'm remembering stuff.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LIBBY: You are? You mean I'm not crazy?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: No, I don't think you are.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: We're here.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: What is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: It's a well.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Let me guess. You're wondering how deep it is?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: You read my mind.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: You have any idea how old this well is, Desmond?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Very old?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: That's exactly right, very old. So old in fact, that the people who dug this well did it completely by hand. God knows how long it took 'em.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: That seems like a lot of work just to get some water.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Oh, they weren't looking for water. They were looking for answers. A long time ago places like the one we're standing at right now made compass needles spin. And the people holding the compasses needed to know why, so they dug.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Did they find what they were looking for?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: No, they didn't. The reason I wanted you to see this, Desmond, is because Charles Widmore is not interested in answers, he's only interested in power. And he brought you back to the Island so that you could help him find what he's looking for. After all, this isn't the only well.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: And that's the reason you wanted me to see this?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Why aren't you afraid?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: You're out here, middle of the jungle, with me, not a person on earth even knows you're here. Why aren't you afraid?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: What is the point in being afraid?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Aah!
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAYID: How's our friend?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: You don't have to worry about him any more.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAWYER: Where you been?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: I went for a walk, James.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAWYER: Well, now that you've stretched your legs, maybe you can--
Lost.Season06.Episode11 SAWYER: Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Ummm...hey.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Hello, Hugo.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: I don't know who you are, dude, or what you want, but we have to talk to you.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: We?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: There are other people with me. The thing is...you got weapons and we got weapons, and I don't want anyone to get hurt...or killed. So, we're not gonna do anything. I want your word that you're not gonna do anything either.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: You have my word.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 HURLEY: Okay guys, come on out.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 LOCKE: Hello, Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 BEN: Hello there. You wating for someone in particular?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 BEN: Well, I noticed you've been parked here a while watching the kids, and well, it is a school. Do you have a child who goes here?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: No. No. I was um, uh, I just moved to the neighborhood, and um, and, uh, I'm looking for a school for my son.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 BEN: What's your son's name?
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: Charlie.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 BEN: Well, as a teacher here I can vouch for it completely. It's a wonderful school.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 DESMOND: That's great to hear, thanks. Well, it was nice talking to you.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 BEN: Have a good day.
Lost.Season06.Episode11 BEN: Call 911, do it now! Mr. Locke? Oh, my God. Don't, don't move. We're gonna get you to the hospital. Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke? Can you hear me?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Hello, Jack. I was hoping you'd come.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: I think we have some catching up to do.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Hurley. This was your idea. You alright with me talking with him alone?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY:  It's all you, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK:  Alright, let's catch up.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Look just like him.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Does it bother you?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: No, what bothers me is I don't have any idea what the hell you are.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Sure you do.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Why John Locke?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Because he was stupid enough to believe that he'd been brought here for a reason. Because he pursued that belief until it got him killed. And because you were kind enough to bring his body back here in a nice wooden box.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: He had to be dead before you could look like him.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: That's right.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Who else have you looked like?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Jack, what do you really want to ask me?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: The third day we were here I saw... I chased my father through the jungle... my, my dead father.  Was that you?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Yes, that was me.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: You needed to find water. This may be hard for you to believe, Jack, but all I've ever been interested in is helping you.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: To help me? To do what?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Leave. But because Jacob chose you, you were trapped on this Island, before you even got here.  Now Jacob's dead. We don't have to be trapped anymore. We can get on an airplane and fly away anytime we want to.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: If we can just fly away whenever we want, why are you still here?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Because it has to be all of us.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: John Locke was the only one of us that ever believed in this place. He did everything he could to keep us from leaving this island.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: John Locke was not a believer, Jack.  He was a sucker.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 EMT #1:  Sinus tach at one-thirty. BP dropping. Last read was sixty-two over thirty possibly due to internal bleeding.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MAN ON RADIO: Any signs of neurological damage?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 EMT #1: No response in lower reflexes.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 BEN: That's because he's a paraplegic.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 EMT #1: You know this man?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 BEN: Yes, he's a substitute teacher at my school. His name is Locke... Mr. Locke. I don't know his first name, but he uses a wheelchair. Where is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 EMT #1: Smashed to pieces. That thing probably saved his life.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 BEN: I saw the man that did this... the, the hit-and-run driver. He, he was at our school--
Lost.Season06.Episode12 EMT #1: When we get to the hospital you can talk to the cops. Do you know anyone we can contact for him?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 BEN: I have no idea. Like I said, I barely know him.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Helen.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 BEN: What did you say?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Helen Norwood. I was gonna marry her.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 BEN: Well, you're still gonna marry her 'cause you're gonna be okay, Mr. Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: John. My name is John.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 EMT #1: Blunt-force trauma victim. Late forties, male. He needs a CT scan.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 EMT #2: We got a gun shot wound here. Female, entry wound. Upper right quadrant.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JIN:  Baby! Baby!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 EMT #2: Yes, sir, I understand. She's pregnant. We're gonna take good care of her. Five-hundred cc's
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JIN: Baby!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 EMT #2: External blood loss.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JIN: Baby!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 EMT #2: We're gonna do everything we can.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SUN: 안돼... 안돼! 
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JIN: 왜 그래? 
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SUN: 저 사람... 저 사람이야! 저 사람... 
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: What is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: You can come out!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: You following us, Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: 'Cause he's my brother.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Looks like you two have a lot of catching up to do. I'll leave you to it.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Claire, I'm... I'm so sorry th--
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Did he tell you? That he was the one pretending to be our father?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Yeah. Yeah, he told me.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: You know, I pretty much gave up hoping that you'd ever come back. Now that you're here...
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: It's... it's good to see you, Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Yeah, it's good to see you too.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: You know, I-I never really had much in the way of family, so it...really means a lot that you're coming with us.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Actually, I haven't-I haven't decided if I'm coming with you.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Yeah, you have.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: What do you mean?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: You decided the moment you let him talk to you, just like the rest of us. So, yeah, whether you like it or not, you're with him now.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY: Has he got a submarine?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER:  Keep your voice down, damn it. Yeah, Widmore's got a sub. We can use it to get off this rock.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY: Are we gonna tell Sun?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Kate's telling her now. Thought we might want to avoid huddles.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY: What about Sayid?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Sayid ain't invited. He's gone over to the dark side.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY: Yeah, but you can always bring people back from the dark side. I mean, Anakin--
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Who the hell's Anakin? Look, just keep your mouth shut. Don't say nothing to no one.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Hey.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY: Hey, Claire.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Hey, Hurley.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY: You look great.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: It's so nice to have everyone back together again.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Want an apple?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Hey, Schaub, I'm the one who brought her in. Wanna give us a minute?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Katherine Anne Austen. You're wanted for arson, assault on a federal officer, murder in the first degree.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Funny, you don't strike me as the murdering kind.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: That's because I'm not.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: You be sure and mention that to feds when they get here.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: There something you wanted?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: You remember me? The airport? We were on the same flight from Sydney.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: Yeah, I remember.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Well, don't you think it's weird--you and me being on the same flight, having that little meet-up in the elevator? And a week later--boom, of all the cars in Los Angeles, you smash into mine. Almost like someone's trying to put us together.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: Are you hitting on me?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER:  It'd never work, sweetheart. I'm a cop, you're a murderer.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: I already told you, I'm not a murderer.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Yeah, well, I'm still a cop.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: So, why didn't you arrest me?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: I did arrest you.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: No, in L.A.X., the elevator, you saw I was wearing handcuffs.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: I didn't see any handcuffs. All I saw was a pretty lady who needed the door held open for her.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: You know what I think? I think you let me go because you went to Australia, and you didn't want anyone to know you were there. Should I tell that to the feds when they get here?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Oh, I like you.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: Mm.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MILES: Jim, got a live one. Come on.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Sorry, duty calls.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MILES: We caught a multiple homicide at a restaurant. Victims were a lowlife named Keamy and three goons on his payroll. Korean female GSW at the scene, and her boyfriend witnessed it, but he doesn’t speak English.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Any suspects?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MILES: Yeah, an ATM surveillance camera grabbed this jabroni fleeing the scene.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: All righty. Put a name to that face.  That's our bad guy.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: He's different now.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK:  Guess we're all different now.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: So what did Locke say to you?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Said that he wants to leave, and we all have to go together.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: And do you believe him?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: I'm not sure yet.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MAN: Hands up. Stop right there.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ZOE: Where's the man in charge?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY: Who's she?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: That's Widmore's number two.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: What can I do for you?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ZOE: You took something from us, and we want it back.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: It's okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ZOE:  Do you have fix on my position?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MAN: Roger that.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ZOE: Show them what we're capable of.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ZOE: You have until nightfall to return what you took; or next time, we won't miss.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ZOE: Call me when you're ready for us to pick him up.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Well...here we go.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Uh, hi. I have an appointment with the Western Pacific Adoption Agency.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MAN: Fifteenth floor, and sign in, please.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Sure. 
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: Hey there. How are you? Uh, we met at the airport. The, uh, the baggage claim.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Oh, yeah, right.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: Nice. I'm Desmond. Desmond Hume. Um, I never got your name. Uh...  "Claire Littleton." So--So how you doin'?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Um, I'm okay. Better now. I actually had a bit of a scare, ended up in the hospital.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: Oh, no. I'm sorry. Are you...
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Oh, no. All good now, so... Oh, by the way, uh, you were right. It's a boy.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: I have a nose for these things. Look, um...excuse me if this sounds a bit personal, but I couldn't help noticing you're going to an adoption agency...alone.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Uh...yeah. You're right. It is personal.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: No, I just meant that you should have some--some legal representation.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: What, are you a lawyer?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: No, no. But, uh, it just so happens that I'm on my to see one. You know, adoption contracts are complicated; and, you should be careful because you could find yourself in a situation that's irreversible.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Yeah, I-I don't have money for a lawyer.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: What floor?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: Um...I'm--I'm going to 15 as well. Look, this, um, this attorney I'm seeing--she's excellent. Uh, you know, plus, she owes me a favor. So...why don't you just come and meet her? You know, I think she could really help you.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: Look, I promise you it won't cost you a cent. Please. It'd be my absolute pleasure.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Uh, sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: Great, this way.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: Hi. Uh, Desmond Hume to see Miss Verdansky, please.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 RECEPTIONIST:  Oh, yes, Mrs. Hume, she's expecting you. Have a seat.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: Great.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Hey, um...thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: You're very welcome.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ILANA:  Desmond!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: Ah, Ilana. Uh, Claire, this is Ilana. Ilana, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Claire Littleton.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ILANA: Claire Littleton, um...
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: I was hoping you'd be able to help her, um...
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ILANA: I'm sorry...Claire Littleton from Australia?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Um, do I know you?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ILANA: No, but this is a quite a coincidence. We've been looking for you. Desmond, do you mind if I speak with Miss Littleton alone for a few minutes?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: No, absolutely fine. Go right ahead.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Listen up, everyone.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Hey. What's going on?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY: People trying to kill us again.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: All this is happening a bit sooner than I'd expected, but these people have forced our hand, claiming we stole something from them, trying to provoke us into a confrontation. Well, if that's what they want, that's what they'll get. Gather your things, we're going to the other island and we're getting on that plane. James, I need your help with something.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: There's a boat moored just a few hours down the shore from here. I want you to get it and meet the rest of us on the other side of these bluffs.  We'll all sail over to the other island together.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: How come we're not all heading for it together?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: The bigger the group, the slower it moves.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: All right. I could use another pair of hands.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Take whoever you want.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: How about it, Freckles? Know anything about sailing?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: I know enough.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Good. We'll be waitin' for ya. Sayid, you got a minute?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER:  Give me a hand with something?  Listen up, 'cause I’m only gonna say this once. We're not going to that rendezvous point to pick up Locke. I got a deal with Widmore.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: What kind of deal?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Just listen. First chance you get, double back, hoof it to this spot.  There's an old dock. Grab Hugo, Sun and Lapidus. Kate and I will meet you there.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: What about Sayid and Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER:  Sayid's a zombie and Claire's nuts. She gave up her ticket when she tried to kill Kate. And I ain't gonna let that happen again. It's Hugo, Sun and the pilot. Only them. Understand?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: But, how am I supposed to get us away from--from Locke?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: You figure it out.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Ready to roll?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: What was that all about?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Guy talk.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: I need you to go out to where I've got Desmond.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: I thought you weren't going to give him back.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: I'm not. You're gonna kill him. And that's not gonna be a problem, is it, Sayid? You do still want what you asked me for, right?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: Yes, I do.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Then, go do what I said.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: So what did he offer ya? If you're gonna shoot me in cold blood, brother...I think I have a right to know what you're getting in exchange for it.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: He told me I could get something back I lost.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: And what did you lose?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: The woman I loved.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: And where is she now?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: Dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: And what makes you think Locke can bring her back?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: I died...and he brought me back.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: So, what will you tell her?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: What do you mean?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DESMOND: This woman--when she asks you what you did to be with her again...what will you tell her?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 NADIA:  Sayid. What's going on?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: Everything will be okay for you now. I took care of it.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 NADIA: What do you mean? Where are you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: I have to leave.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 NADIA: Did you hurt someone?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: Nadia, I'm leaving. And I'm never going to be able to come back again.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 NADIA: What did you do, Sayid?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID : Stall them.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 NADIA: Who is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MILES: LAPD.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 NADIA: May I see some identification?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MILES: Can you open the door, please.  Mrs. Jarrah, I'm Detective Straume. I need to ask you some questions. You have a few minutes?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: That's good, stay down.  Sayid Jarrah, you're under arrest.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Thar she blows.  You ready to get wet?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: Ah. You sure this is a good idea?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: You see a bridge?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: Going back to get Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Course not. It's a terrible idea, which is why we ain't doing it.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: We're gonna ditch Locke. You, me Jack, Hurley, Sun and that pilot that looks like he's stepped off the set of a Burt Reynolds movie.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: When were you planning on telling me this?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Now.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: Wait, you didn't say Claire.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: She ain't coming. The Claire you came back for is gone.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: I promised I would bring her back.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: That was before she started drinkin' Locke's kool-aid. She's dangerous, you really want her around Aaron? Let's go. We ain't got much time.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Hey, Claire.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: How long have you been with Locke?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Ever since you left.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: So you trust him?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACKS: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: 'Cause he's the only one that didn't abandon me.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Sun. Have you seen Sayid? He was supposed to catch up with us about a half a mile back.  Oh, the silent treatment?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 : "You did this to me!"
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE:  I'm sorry, Sun, but I didn't do anything to you.  James should be on his way by now. Just keep everyone moving to the beach, I'll catch up with you there.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CINDY: Where are you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: I wanna make sure nobody got left behind.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Hurley, wait up.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY: Yeah?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Sun.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: We have to go now.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LAPIDUS: Go where?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: There's no time. We just gotta go. Follow me.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY: Um, I think we should stick to Sawyer's plan, or he'll be really pissed.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: This is Sawyer's plan. Let's go!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Sayid. Where have you been?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: Doing what you asked.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Then, what took you so long?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: I just shot an unarmed man. I needed a moment.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Did you kill him, Sayid?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAYID: Of course, I did.  Go and check, if you like.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Come on, we have a boat to catch.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LAPIDUS: Hope you know where you're going. Because that smoke thing runs a hell of a lot faster than we do.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Sawyer said there'd be a dock around here somewhere.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY: There they are!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: Hey.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Alright, let's go. Everybody on board, let's go!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LAPIDUS: Sailin' home on this, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Won't work, not without a bearing. For three years the only DHARMA folk ever got on or off this Island was by sub, so that's what we're doin'. Nice job, doc.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 HURLEY: Uh oh.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Where are you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: Claire...it's okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: We're leaving the Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Then, uh, why aren't you waiting for John?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: Because that's not John, and whoever he is, he's not one of us. Claire, come with us. I can get you back to Aaron.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Wait a damn minute-
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: Sawyer shut up. She is coming or I'm not. Come with us Claire.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE:  John promised me-
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: No I'm promising you. I was there when he was born, and I never should have raised him, it should have been you. I came back to get you so you can be with him again. It's the only reason I came back to the Island, Claire. So please come with us. Let's go home.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Alright, get on the boat before Locke gets here.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: He finds out we're gone, he's gonna be mad.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK:  It's your mom.  Hey. Yeah, we just got here. Thank you. Uhh, I don't know, I'll have him home as soon as I can, maybe like 5 o'clock?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Actually, um, we might grab a bite to eat afterwards, so...maybe more like 7? Alright. Yeah, yeah I'll drop him off.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK:  Hey. You know, hearing your grandfather's will being read, I know it's not the most fun, but it'll be over soon, I promise, and it's okay to be sad.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DAVID: I'm sad for you, Dad.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ILANA: Mr. Shephard.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK:  Hello.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ILANA: And you must be David.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DAVID:  Hi.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ILANA: We're set up in the conference room. I've got a surprise for you. Do you believe in fate?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ILANA: This is Claire Littleton. Claire, this is Mr. Shephard and his son David.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK:  Hello. I'm Jack Shephard.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: Hi, it's uh, it's really nice to meet you.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: You found her.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ILANA: Actually, she found us.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Uh. You were in my father's will. Do you mind if I ask you how you knew him?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 CLAIRE: I...he was my father too.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: I'm sorry, excuse me. This is the, um, this is the service.  Yeah, this is Dr. Shephard. No-no it's not a very good time. Yes, they can go ahead and prep him. I'm 20 minutes away.  I'm, so sorry, there's been an emergency at the hospital. And, um, we're going to have to reschedule.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LAPIDUS: I know I'm a little late to the party, Captain, but, you mind filling us in on what your game plan is?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: My plan, Chesty, is to land on Hydra Island, get ourselves nice and cuddly with Widmore until we get a chance to jump on that sub. Then I'm gonna put a gun in someone's face and make 'em take us home.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LAPIDUS: I like that idea...I saw some canned food down in the galley. Anybody else starving?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Freckles, take the wheel a minute?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: Sure...Be nice.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Yeah, yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Didn't think you'd show up, doc.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Sorry?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Taking orders ain't your strong suit. Nice to see you finally came around.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: This doesn't feel right.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: What doesn't feel right?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Leaving the island.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Wanna tell me why not?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Because I remember how I felt last time I left...like a part of me was missing.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: They got pills for that, doc.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: We were brought here because we're supposed to do something, James. And if Locke--that...that thing--wants us to leave; maybe it's afraid of what happens if we stay.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Get off my damn boat.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: You got a decision to make and you make it now. Either you’re with us, you keep that damn crazy talk to yourself, or you're going in the water.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: James, this is a mistake. And I know there's a part of you that feels that. The island's not done with us yet.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Yeah, well, I'm done with this island. So, if you wanna take a leap of faith, Jack, then take it...Get off my damn boat.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: I'm sorry that I got Juliet killed.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: Jack? Jack?!  What did you say to him?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: He changed his mind.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: What do you mean he changed his mind? What did you say to him?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: He ain't coming with us.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 KATE: We have to go back and get him.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: We're done going back, Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SUN: 
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JIN: 
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SUN: 
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JIN: 
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SUN: 
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JIN:  It's over...and we're all going to be okay.]
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DAVID: So, all these years, you had no idea your dad had another kid?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Nope. None.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DAVID: Wow. I can't believe he never even mentioned her.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Yeah, well, your grandfather kept a lot of things to himself.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DAVID: Is that where you get it from?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK:  Yeah, probably... All right, uh, you gonna be okay hangin' while I do this?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 DAVID: Yeah, sure...Good luck, Dad.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 FEMALE SURGEON: Car v. ped.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: How bad?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 FEMALE SURGEON: Bad. But, here's the kicker--the victim was already in a wheelchair, pre-existing spinal condition.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Dural sac's obliterated.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 FEMALE SURGEON: That's why we called you. We're in a bit over our heads here.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Yeah, I got this.  We're ready to cut?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 FEMALE SURGEON: Say the word.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Scalpel.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 FEMALE SURGEON: What is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: I think I know this guy.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Nice day for a swim... Sawyer took my boat, didn't he?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Everybody stay close. Camp's over here. Not gonna have much time before Locke figures out we made off with his ride.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MAN: Hands up!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Hey! Whoa!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MAN: Drop your weapons!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Whoa! Take it easy!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ZOE: Drop them now! ... It's all right. We know him. Who else is with you?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: Nobody. You wonder where Locke is, he's still back on the main island.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ZOE:  Turn the fences off.  Ford just showed up on a boat with five of his friends. 
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JIN: Sun?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SUN: Jin?  Jin?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JIN: Sun! 
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SUN: I love you!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JIN: I love you, too.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SUN: I never stopped looking for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LAPIDUS: Looks like someone got their voice back.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JIN:  We'll never be apart again. I promise you.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ZOE:  Are you sure? I-I understand, Charles.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: That Widmore?  What the hell are you doin'?
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ZOE: What's it look like I'm doing? Hands up, now!  On your knees. All of you!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MAN:  Down!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 SAWYER: We had a deal!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 ZOE: Deal's off... We got 'em. If you've got a sightline on Locke, fire when ready.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 MAN: Roger.
Lost.Season06.Episode12 JACK: Get down!
Lost.Season06.Episode12 LOCKE: Jack. You all right?  Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. You're with me now.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke? Mr. Locke, can you hear me?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Welcome back.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: I know you...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: We were on the same flight back from Sydney. I met you in the baggage claim office, you had lost your knives. I'm Jack Shephard.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: You were run down by a car. You just came out of surgery.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: Am I... am I alright?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Your dural sac ruptured, but I think I got everything back where it belongs.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Mr. Locke, while I was operating I got a look at the initial injury to your spine, the one that put you in a wheelchair. And... I was hoping you could tell me how that happened.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Because I think you're a candidate.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: A candidate for what?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: A new procedure. A surgery we're developing. And if it works it could restore feeling to your legs. In fact, you may even walk again. If you'll give me a shot, Mr. Locke, I think that... that I could fix you.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: No. Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Now, there's minimal risk, and the benefit--
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: I said no, doctor.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: John?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: Oh John, this is the first time they let me see you. Are you okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: I'm fine.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: Are you his doctor?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Yes, I am. Dr. Shephard.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: Thank you. Thank you for saving him. Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAYID: Welcome to Hydra Island. At least you didn't have to paddle.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SEAMUS: Get in.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Uh-uh. No way I'm getting back in those cages.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SEAMUS: Well I've got the gun, so you--
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Not anymore, doughboy.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 WIDMORE: Drop the gun! Put the gun down or I'll kill her!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: You ain't gonna kill anybody. Otherwise you wouldn't be throwin' us in a cage.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 WIDMORE: I have a list of names. Ford, you're on it. As are Reyes and the Kwons. Kate Austen? She's not. It doesn't matter to me whether she lives or dies.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE: Don't listen to him.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 WIDMORE: You may not believe it, but I'm doing this for your own good.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: You're right. I don't believe it.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 WIDMORE: Is the fence live yet?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 PAUL: They're saying about an hour...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 WIDMORE: We haven't got an hour! Tell them to work faster! He's coming...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Hello?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Excuse me? Hello?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 BERNARD: Oh!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: I'm sorry. There was no one out front and I heard the drill... do you know where I can find Dr. Nadler?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 BERNARD: Well, you can find him right here. And, if you're not a patient, you can call me Bernard.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Hi. I'm Jack Shephard.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Um, I'm a surgeon over at St. Sebastian, and I was hoping to get a look at one of your patient files.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 BERNARD: And which patient would that be?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: His name's John Locke, and our records said that you had done some emergency oral surgery on him about three years back.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 BERNARD: And what are you looking for exactly?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: I want to know how he was hurt.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 BERNARD: Do you mind if I ask you why you're so interested in Mr. Locke, Jack?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Um... he and I met about a week ago. We were on the same flight back from Australia--
Lost.Season06.Episode13 BERNARD: Oceanic 815.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 BERNARD: I sat across the aisle from you. If memory serves, you were flirting with my wife, Rose, while I was in the bathroom. It's pretty weird, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 BERNARD: Well, then maybe you're on to something here, hmm? Now, I can't break patient confidentiality and tell you something I shouldn't... but I can tell you that when I treated Mr. Locke, there was another man in the same accident with him.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: That was three years ago... you just remember that?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 BERNARD: Of course I do, Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Anthony Cooper...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 BERNARD: Good luck, doc. I hope you find what you're looking for.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAYID: There was a mortar attack. Widmore's people fired on us. Locke saved you.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: What about the rest of your group? What happened to them?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAYID: The ones who weren't killed scattered into the jungle. It's just the three of us now.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Why did he bring me here?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: Because your friends got themselves captured. And now we're going to have to rescue them.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Rescue them from what?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: Widmore has them in a cage about half a mile inland.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Why would he--
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: You know, I would ask him, except I don't think he's gonna give me a straight answer. But I can't imagine that his intentions are good. If we move right now, we can break your people out, run for the plane, and be off this island before Widmore knows what hit him.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: They're not my people. And I'm not leaving the Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: Well Jack, I'm hoping you still change your mind about that. But your friends do want to leave. And since they just ran away from me, on my own boat, I'm gonna need your help convincing them that they can trust me.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Why should I trust you?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: Because I could kill you, Jack. Right here. Right now. And I could kill every single one of your friends. And there's not a thing that you could do to stop me. But instead of killing you, I saved your life. And now I want to save them too. So will you help me?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Feel like we're running in circles? Back in these cages... except last time the gun was to my head.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE: He wouldn't have killed me, James.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: That cave I told you about... where all the names were written... your name was there too. But it was crossed out. He doesn't need you, Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: So she's with your mother?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SUN: Yes. You saw her pictures? How?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: Widmore's people found your camera on the plane. He showed me the pictures. Our daughter... she's so beautiful.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SUN: I have your ring.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Uh-oh...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 MAN: What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 MAN: Somebody shut it down? What's going on?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 PAUL: Somebody killed the power.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SEAMUS: Get a team to that generator now!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: And we're dead...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 MAN: Go, go, go.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SEAMUS: Ahh!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE: I think I can reach the keys! 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: Hurry! When that thing's done with them, he's coming for us!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Well, I ain't waitin'!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE:  Uh, damn it!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: I'm with him. Come on.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: How much further to the plane?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Say about a quarter mile. Just over that ridge.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE: So you're coming with us now?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: I'm going to take you to the plane but I'm not getting on it. I'm sorry, Kate. I'm... I'm not meant to go.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Thanks for comin' back for us, doc. Appreciate it.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: No, it's okay! Sayid's with us. He was the one who turned off the generators.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Great. The more the merrier.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAYID: We need to go. Locke's waiting.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 NURSE: Are you a relative of Mr. Cooper's?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Uh, no. No I'm not. But--
Lost.Season06.Episode13 NURSE: May I ask the nature of the visit?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Um...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: Dr. Shephard?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Hey.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Um... I'm here to see Anthony Cooper. Do you know him? Is that why you're here too?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: What do you want with Anthony?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: I want to talk to him about the accident that he was in with Mr. Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: Uh... Dr. Shephard... just go.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Look, all I want to do is help him.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: I know. John told me about the operation. He doesn't want it.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Why doesn't he want it?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: Please Dr. Shephard, just leave this alone. You saved John's life. Why can't that be enough?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Because it's not.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: Hi.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HELEN: This is Anthony Cooper. He's John's father.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 WHEELER: Hey! Stop! Stop right there!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Alrighty... let's see what it'll take to get this baby to fly.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Son of a bitch!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAYID: His neck's been broken.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: That's because I broke it. If it's any consolation, Widmore knew that I would kill these men.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: What are you talkin' about?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: They were only guarding the plane for show. If Charles had really wanted to keep me from actually getting on board he wouldn't have moved his little fences.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: Well... wait, now he wants us to leave the Island?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: No, Hugo. He wants to get us all in the same place at the same time... a nice confined space we have no hope of getting out of... and then he wants to kill us.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Kill us with what?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: With this.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: Four bricks of C-4. I found them in one of the overheard compartments, wired to the electrical system of the plane. If we would've turned it on... boom.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: So what now?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: We can't be sure he didn't put more explosives on the plane. It's not safe. If we're gonna leave the island, I think we have to take the submarine.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Well that's what I've been saying all along.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude, wait... he's not supposed to leave the island. I mean, Alpert said that--
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Screw Alpert. He ain't here.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: That's twice you've saved our asses. Guess I was wrong about you.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: Thank you, James.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: That submarine is gonna be heavily defended. We're gonna need everyone.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: I'll help you but, like I said, I'm not going with you.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: Fair enough. Let's go.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Hey... I'm sorry I--
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: It's alright, Claire. I understand why you went with them.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Hey doc, listen up... you don't wanna leave this island, that's your own damn business. But I'm gonna ask you for one last favor. I don't trust that thing one bit, so here's what I need you to do... once we get to the dock, you make sure it doesn't get on the sub.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: How am I supposed to do that? You saw what it did back there.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Just get it in the water, I'll take care of the rest.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 WOMAN:  CT test to Trauma 3. CT test to Trauma 3.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Mr. Locke, are you awake?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN:  Push the button.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK:  Mr. Locke, can you hear me?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN:  I wish you had believed me.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 WOMAN:  Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Miss Littleton.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Dr. Shepard. I--I was just looking for you. The, um, the lawyer told me you were here.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Um, c-can we talk?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Yes. Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Oh, no. I'm okay. 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Sorry, I had to run out of the will-reading the other day, but I did have an emergency, and...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Oh, no worries.  Um, I know this is as awkward for you as it is for me. Never even met this man.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Anyway, the, uh, lawyer gave me this. She said, uh, there'd be more stuff to come, but that my father especially wanted me to have this.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Do you know why or what it's suppose to mean?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: I have no idea; but, then... I--I didn't know about you either.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Our father, uh... you mind, you mind if I ask how he died?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: He was found in an alley outside a bar in Sydney. He drank himself to death. I flew down to bring his body back... but then, uh... the airline lost it.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: I just flew in from Sydney a few days ago.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: When?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Uh, last Wednesday?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK:  Oceanic Flight 815?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Uh, yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Do you mind if I have a look at that? 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Uh, sure, go ahead.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK:  I'm sorry. I--I wish I knew why he wanted you to have this. 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Yeah, me, too.  Well, um. It was nice seeing you again.  Thanks for trying to help.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Where are you staying?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Uh, just down the road...motel.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 Jack: Why don't you come stay with me?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Stay with you?  I mean, we're...we're strangers.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK:   No, we're not strangers. We're...we're family.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Just 'cause there ain't any goons on the dock, doesn't mean they ain't on the sub. We’re goin' in hard. Got it? Lapidus, Hugo, Jin, Sun--you're with me. The rest of you wait 30 seconds, head down the dock behind us.  You think you two can get our backs?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Absolutely.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: All right. Let's go home. 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 MAN:  After engine room, power the bilges. After engine room, power the bilges, please.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Where's the damn captain?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Put your damn hands up.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Nothin' personal.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Okay, Hoss, how about you get ready to fire this thing up?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LAPIDUS:  I got it.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE: Let's go.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: You sure you won't reconsider, Jack?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Yeah, I'm sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: Whoever told you, you needed to stay had no idea what he was talking about.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: John Locke told me I needed to stay. 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE: What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Kate?!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE: Ahh.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAYID: Claire, let's go now! 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: What's going on up there? What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Widmore's people shot her. Hurley, I need a first aid kit.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Who else is up there?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAYID: Claire.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Claire!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: James!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Lapidus, if you can hear me...DIVE! DIVE!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LAPIDUS:  Let's go!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Hey! Wait! Wait!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: Claire! Claire! Wait! 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: What the hell are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: What we came here to do...leaving.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: It's alright. It's alright.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: No! They're leaving us.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: No trust me. You don't want to be on that sub.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE:  Claire? Where's Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: She's still up there.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE: No, we can't leave without her...we can't... 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 Jack: "Kate..." or "Okay".
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Is she gonna be okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: Jack, can't find first-aid kit, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Jin--my pack. There might be a shirt in there I can use for pressure.  It's okay. Just relax. Everything's gonna be alright.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: Here. Can you help her? 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: I think the bullet went straight through...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER : What?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude, where did that come from?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Locke. We did exactly what he wanted.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: We have to get to the surface.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: What the hell?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: We have to get to the surface now!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN:  Lapidus, take us up.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LAPIDUS: We're divin'!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: Just do it!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LAPIDUS:  You heard him. Up!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: Dude how'd that get on the sub?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK:  Locke put it in my pack.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: Why would he do that? He wanted to come with us?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Damn right he did, that's why I shut his ass out.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: He wanted you to shut him out.  Any idea how that thing works? Can we turn it off?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAYID: This watch is jury-rigged to the battery. The battery detonates the explosives.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER:  How much time till we're up, Frank?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LAPIDUS: At least 5 minutes.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: We ain't got 5 minutes. What's it gonna be Sayid?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAYID: These wires--they're leads from the watch. If we disconnect them from the battery, technically speaking, the bomb should be inert.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Technically?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAYID: Yes, but you need to pull them out simultaneously; and, I'm not sure...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Step aside.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Wait! Wait!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: What the hell are you doin', doc?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Nothing's gonna happen.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Don't pull those wires out. We're okay. Nothing's gonna happen.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: If I don't pull these wires, Locke's gonna blow us to kingdom come.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: No, he's not! Locke can't kill us.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: Uh...what?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: This is what he wanted.  This is what he's been waiting for. Everything that he has done has been to get us here. He wanted to get us all in the same place, at the same time--a nice, enclosed space where we had no hopes of getting out of.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: I don't understand.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Locke said that he can't leave the island without us. I think that he can't leave the island unless we're all dead. He told me that he could kill anyone of us whenever he wanted. So, what if he hasn't because he's...he's not allowed to. What if he's trying to get us to kill each other?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Stay out of my way, doc.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Now if he wanted that thing to blow up, why would he put a timer in it?  Why not just throw it inside?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: I don't care.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Nothing is gonna happen.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: It's not your decision to make.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: He can't kill us!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK:  James. We are going to be okay. Just have to trust me.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Sorry, doc, I don't.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAYID:  Listen carefully. There's a well on the main island, half mile south from the camp we just left. Desmond's inside it. Locke wants him dead, which means you're going to need him. Do you understand me?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Why are you telling me this?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAYID: Because it's going to be you, Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY:  Sayid!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LAPIDUS: Ah, hell!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Are you okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: What happened? Did Sayid just...?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SUN: Help!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: Wait!  Hold on. I'll get you out...Sawyer! I need help!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Jin!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Hurley! Hurley! You gotta take Kate out of here.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: What about everybody else?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: I'll take care of them! 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: I have to go after Sayid!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: There is no Sayid! Listen to me. Take this tank and buddy-breathe and swim out where the blast hole is, okay? Hurley, you can do this, okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 Jack: Go!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SUN: 너무 아파!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SAWYER: Doc!  Push.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: On three.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 ALL: One... two... three...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: Sawyer! Jack!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Sawyer! Sawyer!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SUN: Jin... Go!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SUN: Save yourself.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: I'm going to get you out of here.  Go. Go. I'll get her free.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: No, we can do this!
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: Just go! Save Sawyer.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK:  Jin take this. I can get him out without it.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: No, you can't Jack. Just go! Go.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN:  Ahh...Uhhh
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SUN: Jin. You have to go.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: No. I can do this.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SUN: No. No, you can't.  Please go.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN:  I won't leave you.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN: I'm gonna get you out of here.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SUN:  Go... Please! Go.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JIN:  당신하고 같이 있을게. 다시는 떠나지 않을거야.   I love you, Sun. 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 SUN:  I love you.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 ORDERLY: Is somebody meeting you, Mr. Locke
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: Yes, my fiancée, Helen. She's, um... ...probably stuck in traffic... Hey, I'll take it from here. I'm pretty good at this.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 ORDERLY: Well, the best of luck to you, sir.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: Thank you. See ya. 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Mr. Locke. I'm glad I caught ya. I hadn't have a chance to say goodbye yet.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: Well, goodbye..and thanks again, Dr. Shepherd. 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK:  I went to see your father.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: W-what?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: When you didn't want the surgery, I felt like I had to understand why...and, uh, I thought that if I could find out why you're in this chair, that maybe...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: I was in a plane crash. I had my-my private pilot's license for a week, and, uh, I begged my father to be my first official passenger. He was terrified of flying. But, I looked him right in the eye--I told him that he could trust me. And we barely got off the ground. I still don't re--I don't remember what I did wrong, but it was my fault. It was my fault. This man, who I loved more than anything, will never walk, or talk or...
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: You know, the first time you and I met, uh, back at the--at the airport...you told me that my father was gone, and, uh, it hurt to hear that, but I knew you were right. Your father's gone, too, Mr. Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: Uh, no, no, he's not.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: Yes, he--he is, and you can punish yourself as much as you want and that's never gonna bring him back. What happened, happened...and...you can let it go.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN: What makes you think letting go is so easy?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: It's not. In fact, I don't really know how to do it myself. And, that's why I was hoping that…maybe you could go first.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JOHN:  Goodbye, Dr. Shephard. 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK:  I can help you, John...I wish you believed me.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE: Jack...I couldn't find you. I couldn't find you. 
Lost.Season06.Episode13 HURLEY: Is he okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 JACK: He got hit in the head pretty hard, but he's breathing.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 KATE: What about Jin and Sun?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: It sunk.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: What, the submarine? But, they-they were all on it, everyone... What? Th-they're all dead?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: Not all of them.
Lost.Season06.Episode13 CLAIRE: Wait. W-where are you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode13 LOCKE: To finish what I started.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Aliquid aegre fers? Dem auxilium tibi. 
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: Gratias ago tibi. 
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: A quo nomine appellaris? 
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: Mihi nomen est Claudia. 
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: That's a lovely name.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: Where are the rest of your people?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: There's only me.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: How did you get here?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER:  The same way you got here. By accident.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: How long have you--
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Every question I answer will simply lead to another question. You should rest. Just be grateful you're alive.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: There were other people on my ship. I need to--
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: No! If there are other people on the island, I will find them.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: The baby?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: Oh!... Oh!... It's coming...
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: That's it! Push! Push harder!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: I can't!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Yes you can!...That's good! One more push!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: It's a boy...
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: His name is Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: It's a boy.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: Can I--
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: There's another baby... push again! Here it comes! Now!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: It's another boy.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: I only picked one name.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER:  Shhh. Shhh.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: May I see him?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: I'm sorry...
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Uhh! Uhh!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: What is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: It's a game. You play it.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: How do you know how?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: I just know.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Can you show me how to play?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: If you promise not to tell Mother.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Why can't we tell her?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Because she'll take it away.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: So... do you want to play or don't you, Jacob?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Yes. I want to play.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER:  Hello, Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Hello, Mother.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Where's your brother?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: He's down at the beach... staring out at the ocean.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Can I help you?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: If you like, you can sort that.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: What were you and your brother doing down at the beach?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: We were just... walking.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Do you love me, Jacob?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Then tell me what happened.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: May I join you?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Jacob told you what I found...
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Of course he did. Jacob doesn't know how to lie. He's not like you.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Why? What am I like?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: You're... special.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Can I keep the game?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Of course you can. That's why I left it for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: It came from you?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Of course it did. Where else would it come from?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: From somewhere else. Across the sea...
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: There is nowhere else. The Island is all there is.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Then where did we come from?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER:  You and your brother came from me, and I came from my mother.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Where's she?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: She's dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: What's dead?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Something you will never have to worry about.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Hurry up, he's getting away!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Hide!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Who are they?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Shh!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Mother! Mother!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: What's wrong?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: We saw people! Men!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: How many were there?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Three... they killed a boar!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Did they see you?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: No. I don't think so.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Where did they come from? They looked like us!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: They're not like us. They don't belong here. We are here for a reason.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: What reason?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: It's not time yet...
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Mother! What reason?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Did you know about the people?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Why didn't you tell us about them?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Because they're dangerous and I didn't want to frighten you.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: What makes them dangerous?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: The same thing that makes all men dangerous. They come, they fight, they destroy, they corrupt... and it always ends the same.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: They come? Come from where?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Another part of the island. And you're never to go looking for them. If they found you, they would hurt you.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Why would they hurt us?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Because they're people, Jacob, and that's what people do.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: But we're people. Does that mean that we can hurt each other?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: I've made it so you can never hurt each other.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: What is this place?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: This is the reason you're here.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Don't go in there.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: What's down there?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Light. The warmest, brightest light you've ever seen or felt. And we must make sure that no one ever finds it.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: It's beautiful...
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Yes it is. And that's why they want it. Because a little bit of this very same light is inside of every man. But they always want more.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Can they take it?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: No. But they would try. And if they tried they could put it out. And if the light goes out here... it goes out everywhere. And so I've protected this place. But I can't protect it forever.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Then who will?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: It will have to be one of you.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: You can’t do that, Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Why not?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Because it's against the rules
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: You made the rules.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: I found it. One day, you can make up your own game and everyone else will have to follow your rules.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: It's all right... Don't be afraid.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: What?  What's wrong?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: I'm going for a walk to the beach. I'll meet you later.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: Hello.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Why can't Jacob see you?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: Because I'm dead... Will you come with me? I'd like to show you something.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Show me what?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: Where you came from. It's across the Island--a place you've never seen.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Who are they?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: They came here 13 years ago. The day before you were born. Their ship was wrecked in a storm.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Ship? What's that?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: It's a way for people to get from one place to another. It's how we came across the sea.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: There's nothing across the sea.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: There are many things across the sea... You come from across the sea, too.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: No. That's not true. That's not what my mother told me.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 CLAUDIA: She's not your mother...I am.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Jacob. Jacob, wake up. Come with me.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Why do you have all your things?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: They're our things... I took them because we're leaving and we're never coming back.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: Just follow me.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Follow you where?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: To the people.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: No. We're supposed to stay away from them.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: They're our people, Jacob, and we're gonna live with them.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: No, mother said--
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: She lied, she lied about everything--all of it. I know you don't understand, but you have to come with me. I don't want to go by myself.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: We can't--Mother loves us.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: She doesn't love us.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Stop!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: It was all a lie!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Stop it!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: She's not even our mother!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Aah!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: No!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Jacob! What are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: He's leaving. He's going to them...to the other people!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: I know now. There is another place across the sea. It's where I'm from and I'm gonna go there. I'm gonna go home.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Who--who told you that?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: My mother!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: I'm your mother.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK: You killed my mother... Jacob, she was your mother, too. We don't belong here. We don't belong with her. Come with me.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER:  My love, you need to know this. Whatever you have been told, you will never be able to leave this Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 BOY IN BLACK:  That's not true. One day I can prove it.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Do you think he'll come back?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: He said you killed our mother... Is that true?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Yes... If I had let her live, she would have taken you back to her people; and those people are bad, Jacob--very bad. I-I couldn't let you become one of them. I needed you to stay good.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Am I good, Mother?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Yes, of course you are.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Then, why do you love him more than me?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: I love you in--in different ways.  Will you stay with me, Jacob? Please?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Yes.  For awhile.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: What do you think?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: It's very nice, Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Are you all right?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: I'm just tired.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: She know you visit me?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: She never asks about you.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Then, I'm sorry I asked about her. Why do you watch us, Jacob?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB:  I watch because I wanna know if Mother's right.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Right about what?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: About them.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Oh, you mean my people. You wanna know if they're bad. That woman may be insane, but she's most definitely right about that.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: I don't know. They don't seem so bad to me.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: That's easy for you to say. Looking down on us from above. Trust me, I've lived among them for 30 years. They're greedy, manipulative, untrustworthy, and selfish.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Then why are you with them?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: They're a means to an end.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: What end?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: I'm leaving, Jacob. I found a way off the Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: No, it's impossible. There is no way off the Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: There are very smart men among us. Men who are curious about how things work. Together we have discovered places all over this Island where metal behaves strangely. When we find one of these sites, we dig. And this time we found something. Come with me, Jacob. Please... What are you gonna do when she dies?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: She's never gonna die.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Jacob, everything dies.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Well, I don't wanna leave this Island. It's my home.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Well, it's not mine.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Where were you?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: You know where I was.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: What did he say to you, Jacob?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: He said he's finally found a way to leave the Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: May I join you.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK:  Yes... How are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: I'm worried.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Well, Mother, you should be. I spent 30 years searching for that place you brought me as a child--that...waterfall with that beautiful light. I've walked this island from end to end, not once coming close to finding it. But, then I began to think--what if the light underneath the island--what if I could get to it from someplace else? Figuring out how to reach it took a very long time.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: The people with you, they saw this, too?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Yes, they have some very interesting ideas about what to do with it.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Do with it? You don't have any idea wh--
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: I have no idea because you wouldn't tell me, Mother.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: What is that?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: It's a wheel... We're going to make an opening...one much bigger than this one; and, then I'm going to attach that wheel to a system we're building. A system that channels the water and the light. And then I'm gonna turn it. And when I do...I'll finally be able to leave this place.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: How do you know all this? How do you know it will work?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: I'm special, Mother.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Please don't do this... Don't go.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: I have to go.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Because I don't belong here.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Then I suppose this is goodbye.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Goodbye, Mother.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER:  I am so sorry... Ahh!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Jacob... It's time.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Something happened, didn't it?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Yes. I had to say goodbye to your brother.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: You're letting him go?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: I don't have a choice. It's what he wants. Do you recognize this place?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Do you remember what I showed you here?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: The light.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: You're going to protect it now.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: What's down there?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Life, death, rebirth. It's the source, the heart of the island. Just promise me. no matter what you do, you won't ever go down there.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Would I die?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: It'd be worse than dying, Jacob...much worse.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER:  Nam non accipimus hoc quasi vulgarem potionem, sed ut ille sit quasi unus mecum. 
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Here. Drink this.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: What happens if I do.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: You'll accept the responsibility that you will protect this place for as long as you can; and, then you'll have to find your replacement.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: I don't want to protect this place.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Someone has to.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: I don't care.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: My time is over.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Why? Why is your time over?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: It has to be you, Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: No, it doesn't. You wanted it to be him. But now I'm all you have.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: It was always supposed to be you, Jacob. I see that now. And one day, you'll see it, too; but, until then...you don't really have a choice... Please, take the cup and drink.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER:  Now, you and I...are the same
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Storm comin'.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Yes, there is... You should go, get some firewood before it rains.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Jacob? Be careful.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: I'll see you back home.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Why wouldn't you let me leave, mother?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MOTHER: Because I...I love you. Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: What did you do?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Wait. Listen.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: What did you do?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: No!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: What did you do?!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: You have--
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Don't. Jacob, don't do this. She burned them. She was crazy. She burned them all! You can't kill me, Jacob. She made it that way. You can't.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Don't worry, brother. I'm not going to kill you.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Uhh.  She brought you back here?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Why would she?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Because I have to protect it now.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Ahh.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: You want to find the light? You want to leave this place, brother? Then go.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 MAN IN BLACK: Uhh!
Lost.Season06.Episode14 KATE: Who are they? Where'd they come from?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACK: Didn't you guys shoot a polar bear last week?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 KATE: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACK: Where'd that come from?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 LOCKE: Hello? Anybody there? Who were these men?
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACK: Actually, one of them's female.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 LOCKE: Our very own Adam and Eve.
Lost.Season06.Episode14 JACOB: Goodbye, brother. Goodbye.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DAVID: Morning.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Morning.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DAVID: I made breakfast.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: You know, technically, opening a box of cereal is not making breakfast.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DAVID: So, you're coming to the concert tonight, right?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Absolutely... Is your mom coming, too?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DAVID:  Yeah... Why?... You're not gonna get all weird, are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Why would I get weird?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DAVID: Just don't get weird.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: I won't.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 CLAIRE: Morning.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Morning.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DAVID:  Morning... You want some cereal?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 CLAIRE: Um, sure. Thanks.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: How you feeling?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 CLAIRE: Uh, pretty good. I mean, he kicks like crazy at night, so...
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Jack Shephard.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MAN: Hello, Mr. Shephard. Uh, this is Oceanic Airlines calling to inform you that we've, um, we've located your missing cargo.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: My father's coffin--you found it?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MAN: Yes, sir. It will be arriving in Los Angeles by the end of the day.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: That's, uh, that's great news. Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MAN: Of, course, sir. We at Oceanic are very sorry it's taken so long.  Good day, sir.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: It's the best I could do, and it's gonna hurt a bit.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: The bullet went straight through, but if I don’t do this, it's gonna get infected.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: 
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: They had a little girl, you know. Her name was Ji Yeon... Jin hadn't even met her yet... Locke did this to them. We have to kill him, Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: I know.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: We should get going, now.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Go where?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Before Sayid died, he said that Desmond was in a well. If Locke wants Desmond dead, then we're gonna need him.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 TEENAGE GIRL: Welcome back, Mr. Locke. It's good to see you.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: Thank you. You, too.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Hey! Don't you dare!  It's him! The guy who hit Mr. Locke. Someone call the police right now!
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: I saw what you did. I'm making a citizen's arrest.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: Do not get in my way.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Don't you--
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: I will not let you hurt Mr. Locke again!
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: I'm not here to hurt him, I'm here to help him let go.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: You wanna know who I am?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MILES: You sure this is a shortcut, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: I lived in these houses a long time, Miles. I think I can remember how to get there.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MILES: Well, I lived in these house 30 years before you did; otherwise known as last week...and I have no idea where the hell we are.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Guess it's a good thing, you're following me.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 RICHARD: You mind if ask how much explosive you have access to, Ben?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: More than enough to destroy the plane ten times over and keep it from ever leaving this island.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 RICHARD: Been a long time. You sure it's still there?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: It's C-4, Richard. I put some thought into hiding it.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MILES: Let me guess--cookie jar.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Don't be ridiculous... It's in my secret room behind the bookcase.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: What's wrong?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MILES: It's just--I--you know, I get wonky around dead stuff.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Do you have something you wanna share with us, Miles?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MILES: I-I don't think...
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: What is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 RICHARD: It's Alex... It's your daughter... After you left, I buried her.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN:  Thank you, Richard.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MILES:  What's that? A secreter room?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: It's where I was told I could summon the monster. That's before I realized that it was the one summoning me.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Okay. Richard, it's your idea. Are we looking to cripple the plane or blow it to hell?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 RICHARD: Blow it to hell.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Then we'd better take it all.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 RICHARD: Don't move! Show me your hands.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ZOE:  Calm down. It's-it's okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Who the hell are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: She's with me.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: Hello, Benjamin... May I come in?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: What are you doing here?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: Put the gun down, Benjamin.  Go to the dock. Take our equipment from the outrigger and then sink it.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ZOE: You got it.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: She's not going anywhere. If you don't answer me, I swear--
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: If you shoot me then your last chance of survival will be gone.  Go. He won't do anything.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: What are you doing here, Richard?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 RICHARD: We're getting explosives to destroy the plane on the other island.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: Why would you want to do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: None of your damned business.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: I've had that plane rigged with explosives since I got here. As usual, Benjamin, I'm three steps ahead of you.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: How did you get back here, Charles?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: Jacob invited me.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: That's a lie. You’ve never even seen Jacob.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: I most certainly have. He visited me, not long after your people destroyed my freighter. He convinced me of the error of my ways; and told me everything I needed to know for this exact purpose.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: What purpose?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ZOE:  Charles?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ZOE: It's Locke. He's coming.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: Has he seen you?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ZOE: No, I don't think so. Our boat is still there. I didn't have time to--
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: Run! Get back here as fast as you can.  If you don't want to die, we need to hide.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 NURSE: This may sting a bit, Mr. Linus.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: It's Doctor Linus, actually.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 NURSE: I'll go get you an ice pack.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JOHN: Dr. Linus? Are you all right? I heard there was a--an incident in the parking lot.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: I guess I got into a fight.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JOHN: A fight? With who?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: I saw the man that ran you down, Mr. Locke. He was back. I approached him, and he just attacked me. And then the strangest thing happened. While he was beating me, I think--I think I saw something.  What are you doing?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JOHN: I'm calling the police.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: You may not want to do that. 
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JOHN: Well, why wouldn't I want to?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: The man told me that he wasn't trying to hurt you. He told me that he was trying to get you to let go.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 OFFICER:  L.A.P.D.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: And for some reason, I believed him.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 OFFICER: Hello, L.A.P.D.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Do you have any idea what he was talking about, Mr. Locke? Does that mean something to you?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 OFFICER: Hello? L.A.P.D.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: Excuse me... Um, I'd like to see a detective, please.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: What's with the getup? Somebody die?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MILES: The benefit at my dad's museum. The concert I've been telling you about all week? Ring a bell?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: Yeah, it's all I've been thinking about.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MILES: You can still be my date, if you want to.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: That red-headed chick that hates me gonna be there?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MILES: Charlotte? Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: Yeah, pass.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 OFFICER: Detective Ford, this guy's got something to tell ya.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: Yeah?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: Um...there was a hit and run a few days ago at Washington Tustin High School and then this morning, one of the teachers there was--was beaten badly by the--by the same suspect.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: Yeah? And?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: I'm the suspect.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: Thanks for saving the taxpayers the trouble of hunting you down.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: You're welcome.  Good afternoon.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: And how are you doing today?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: Terrific.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Any idea exactly where this well is?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: Sayid said it was close to our camp, about an hour away... If Locke wanted Desmond dead, why didn't he just kill him?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Who knows? Maybe it's one of his rules.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: The bomb on the sub...you said he couldn't kill us.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: I've been wrong before.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: I killed them, didn't I?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: No. He killed them.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: You all right?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Yeah. I'm fine.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: Okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Ahh!
Lost.Season06.Episode15 YOUNG JACOB: Give me the ashes.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: What? Who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 YOUNG JACOB: Give me the ashes you took from Ilana's things after she died. I know they're in your pocket.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 YOUNG JACOB: Because they're mine.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: What do you want them for?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Hey!
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Hello, Hugo.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Dude...I've been waiting for you to show up. Where you been?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Doesn't matter. I'm here now.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Did you see a kid run by here with your ashes?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: My ashes are right there in that fire... When it burns out, you'll never see me again.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Uh, what?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: You should get your friends... We're very close to the end, Hugo.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ZOE: Charles, let's go.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: There's no time. Linus has a hidden room, come on... What are you waiting for?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: I'm not interested in hiding. He's gonna find me sooner or later anyway. I'd rather have it over with.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MILES: These are both great plans, but I'm gonna go with surviving... If you need us, we'll be running through the jungle.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Miles, wait.  Give me your walkie-talkies.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Because I asked.  Thank you.  In case I need you...
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: He's gonna kill you. You know that.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Then I guess this is goodbye.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN:  Care to join me outside while I wait for the inevitable?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 RICHARD: I-I'm gonna talk to him. I know this man. All he wants is for me to join him, and if I can get him to leave with me, maybe that'll give the rest of you a chance.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MILES: Good luck with that.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 RICHARD: Ugh!
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: Just the man I was looking for.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Well, you found me.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Can I get you a glass of lemonade?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: I need you...to kill some people for me, Ben.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: And...why would I do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: Because once I leave this island, you can have it all to yourself.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: All right.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: Good... Now whose outrigger is that down at the dock?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: I believe it's Charles Widmore's.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: And do you know where I might find him?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: He's hiding in my closet.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ALEX: Oh, my God. Hey, Dr. Linus.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Hello, Alex.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ALEX: Oh, my God. What happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: I found myself confronting someone that had a bit of a temper.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ALEX: What? Why would someone want to hurt you? You're, like, the--the nicest guy ever.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Guess they had me confused with somebody else.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ALEX: Well, you shouldn't be driving. My mom’s waiting for me over there. Let us give you a ride home.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Oh, no, I'm not going to be any trouble to you.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ALEX: Dr. Linus, please... You've got one hand. You look like Napoleon.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Excellent point.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ALEX: Hey, Mom! Is it okay if we give Dr. Linus a ride home?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ROUSSEAU: Of course. After everything you have done for my daughter, a ride is the least we can do. I'm Danielle.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Benjamin Linus.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ALEX: Hey, Mom, can Dr. Linus come over for dinner? It's coq au vin night.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Oh, that's really not necessary--
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ROUSSEAU: No, we insist. Even if we have to kidnap you.  Here, please.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ROUSSEAU: Do you mind getting that plate? Dr. Linus...thank you. It's so nice to be able to cook for someone other than Alex.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: If you don't mind my asking, where is her father?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ROUSSEAU: He died when Alex was 2.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Oh.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ROUSSEAU: That's probably why she's so attached to you.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ROUSSEAU: All the interest you've taken in her. All the help you've given...you're the closest thing to a father she's ever had.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ROUSSEAU: Are you... are you all right?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: I'm fine. I'm sure it's the onions.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ROUSSEAU: Oh, I'll put in less next time.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: After you... Charles and his lady friend are in here... She's armed. But I'm guessing that's not a problem for you.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: Wait out here... You don't need to see this.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: I want to see this.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Sorry, Charles.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: What a pleasant surprise. How nice to be able to talk without those fences between us.  And who might you be?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ZOE: Zoe. My name is Zoe. I--
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: Don't talk to him. Don't say anything.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: Why would you do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: You told her not to talk to me. That made her pointless... Now, Charles, it's clear you're not afraid to die. So, there's only one way to motivate you to tell me what I want to know. Soon, this will all be over. I'll get what I want. And I'll finally leave this island. And when I do, the first thing I'm going to do is kill your daughter...Penny.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: You'll kill her whether I talk to you or not.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: No, I won't. I give you my word.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: And I'm supposed to take your word?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: You tell me why you came back here and I won't hurt your daughter.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: I brought Desmond Hume back here because of his unique resistance to electromagnetism. He was a measure of last resort.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: What do you mean, "last resort"?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WIDMORE: I'm not saying any more in front of him.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: Well, then whisper to me. Hmm?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: He doesn't get to save his daughter.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE:  Ben...you never cease to amaze me. Fortunately, he had already told me what I needed to know. So, no harm done.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Good... Did you say there were some other people to kill?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Hello, Kate... James... Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: He's right there by the fire, he says hello...
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: I heard him.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: What, you can see him?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Yeah, I can see him.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Kate? Sawyer? You, too? 
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: So, you're the one who wrote our names on the wall.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: I am.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: Sun and Jin Kwon and Sayid Jarrah--you wrote their names on the wall?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: Is that why they're dead?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: I'm very sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: You're sorry?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: No, I wanna know why. I wanna know that Sun and Jin and Sayid didn't die for nothing.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Come and sit down and I'll tell you what they died for... I'll tell you why I chose them...and why I chose you. And then I'll tell you everything you need to know about protecting this island, because by the time that fire burns out, one of you is gonna have to start doing it.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 WOMAN P.A. VOICE: Desk supervisor, dial 41-0-4. Desk supervisor, dial 41-0-4.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JOHN:  You got a minute?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK:  Mr. Locke, yes. Yes, come on in.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JOHN:  Is that your son?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK:  Yes, that's, uh, last Thanksgiving.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JOHN: He looks just like you.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Don't tell him that... So, what can I do for you, Mr. Locke?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JOHN: Dr. Shephard, you and I were on the same plane from Sydney. You gave me your card, and...the next day I threw it away, no offense.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: None taken.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JOHN: Anyway...then a few days later I get hit by a car. And of all the doctors in Los Angeles, I ended up with you. Then a-after you save my life, you still want to fix me and I still don't wanna be fixed. Okay. Then...the man who ran me down shows up at my school today, again. He beat up a teacher in the parking lot. But, do you know what he said to him? He said that he wasn't there to hurt me, he was there to help me "let go," which is exactly the same thing that you said to me the last time we saw each other.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: I'm sorry. Are--are you saying that I sent this man to run you down?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JOHN: No. No. No. No. No. But --but what if all this...maybe this is happening for a reason.  Maybe you're supposed to fix me.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Mr. Locke, I want to fix you, but I think you're mistaking coincidence for fate.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JOHN: You can call it whatever you want, but here I am. And I--I think I'm ready to get out of this chair.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: I don't really know where to start.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: How about why you brought us to the Island?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: I brought all of you here because I made a mistake. A mistake I made a very long time ago, and now, because of that there's a very good chance that every single one of you and everyone you've ever cared about is going to die.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: What mistake?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: You call him "The Monster." But I'm responsible for what happened to him. I made him that way. And ever since then he's been trying to kill me. It was only a matter of time before he figured out how, and when he did, someone would have to replace me. And that's why I brought you all here.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: Tell me something, Jacob. Why do I gotta be punished for your mistake? What made you think you could mess with my life? I was doin' just fine til you dragged my ass to this damn rock.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: No, you weren't. None of you were. I didn't pluck any of you out of a happy existence. You were all flawed. I chose you because you were like me. You were all alone. You were all looking for something that you couldn't find out there. I chose you because you needed this place as much as it needed you.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: Why did you cross my name off of your wall?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Because you became a mother. It's just a line of chalk in a cave. The job is yours if you want it, Kate.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: What is the job?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: There's a light at the center of the Island. You have to make sure it never goes out. That's how you protect it.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: Your monster friend said there is nothing to protect it from.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Hmm. You have to protect it from him... You must do what I couldn't. What I wasn't able to do.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: You want us to kill him? Is that even possible?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: I hope so, because he is certainly going to try to kill you.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: So...how you gonna pick?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: I'm not going to pick, Hugo. I want you to have the one thing that I was never given--a choice.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: And if none of us chooses it?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Then this ends very badly.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: I'll do it... This is why I’m here. This is... this is what I'm supposed to do.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Is that a question, Jack?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: No.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Good... Then it's time.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: And I thought that guy had a God complex before.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: James.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: Yeah, I know.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: I'm just glad it's not me.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Do you remember that bamboo field you woke up in when you first got here?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Beyond that field, across the ridge,  is the heart of the island. That's where the light is... That's where he's trying to go. And that's what you have to protect.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Past the bamboo? There's nothing out there.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Yes, there is, Jack. And now you'll be able to get there... Do you have a cup?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: Yeah. Yeah, actually I do.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB:  Nam non accipimus hoc quasi vulgarem potionem, sed ut ille sit quasi unus mecum.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Drink this.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACK: How long am I gonna have to do this job?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: As long as you can.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 JACOB: Now, you're like me.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: All righty. Here's Jarrah and Hume. Little lady next door is Austen. It's been real nice having y'all...but you're shipping off to county. So best of luck and Vaya con Dios.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 AUSTEN: You could still let me go.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: Why the hell would I do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 AUSTEN: Because I told you I was innocent. And you believe me.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: Doesn't matter. Still can't let you go, I'm a cop.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 AUSTEN: You don't seem like a cop to me.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAWYER: Nice knowin' ya.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 MAN : 1-F-21 responding.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: Think it's time to leave.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: I said, I think it's time to leave. You ready to get out of here?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: I'm sorry. Who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAYID: He's a crazy person who turned himself in.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: What'd you turn yourself in for?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: I ran over a guy in a wheelchair.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAYID: You see what I mean?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: All right. I'm crazy. But do you want to get out of here or not?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: So, what, are you just gonna tell the driver to stop?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: The driver already knows where to stop. But when that happens you're gonna have to give me your trust.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAYID: Our trust?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: That's right? Because after I set you free, I'm gonna ask each of you to do something, and you're gonna have to promise me that you'll do it. So what do you say?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 SAYID: Oh, absolutely, I promise.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: How about you?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: Okay, sure.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: All right, then.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ANA LUCIA: Who's Hume?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: That's me.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ANA LUCIA: Where's your friend with my money? Otherwise I'm gonna have to say I shot all of you trying to escape.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: Don't worry. He'll be here.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: All right here he comes.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Sorry I'm late, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: Don't worry about it.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Oh, hey, you didn't tell me Ana Lucia was gonna be here.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ANA LUCIA: Do I know you, tubby?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Oh, no. We never met. Anyways, here's your money. A hundred twenty-five grand, right?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 ANA LUCIA: Yeah, that's right. Nice not knowing you.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: She's not coming with us?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: No, she's not ready yet.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: I brought you my Camaro. The keys are under the floor mat. Everything else you need's in the trunk.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: All right, good... Um, you know where you're taking them, yeah?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 HURLEY: Absolutely.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: All right, well, we should get going.  Okay, you're with him, and you're with me.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 KATE: What do you mean, I'm with you?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 DESMOND: We... are going to a concert.  Let's go.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Hey, can I ask you something?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: Shoot.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: If you can turn yourself into smoke whenever you want, why do you bother walking?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: I like the feel of my feet on the ground. Reminds me that I was human... We're here.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Are you thirsty?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: This is the well I threw Desmond Hume into.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: What's the matter?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: I sent Sayid to kill Desmond, and obviously, he didn't.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Looks like someone helped him out.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: No, Ben. Someone helped me out.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: What did Widmore say to you?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: He said Desmond was a fail-safe. Jacob's last resort in case, God forbid, I managed to kill all of his beloved candidates. One final way to make sure that I never leave this place.
Lost.Season06.Episode15 BEN: Then...why are you happy that he's still alive?
Lost.Season06.Episode15 LOCKE: Because I'm gonna find Desmond, and when I do, he's gonna help me do the one thing that I could never do myself. I'm gonna destroy the island.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Do you need someone to sign for that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER: You work here?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: I do indeed, brother.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DRIVER: You a priest or something?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Or something... Do you mind taking it around the back there?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DRIVER: Yeah, sure. You got it.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND:  Just around there, thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Who died?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: A man named Christian Shephard.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE:  Christian Shephard? Seriously?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Seriously.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Friend of yours?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Not exactly.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: H-hang on a second. You bust me out of jail, and make me put on this dress so that we can go to some concert. And you won't even tell me why were here.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: No one can tell you why you're here, Kate... Certainly not me.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: You're the one who brought me here.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: I'm not talking about the church. I'm talking about here.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Who are you? What do you want?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: My name is Desmond Hume. And even though you don't realize it, I'm your friend. And, as for what I want--I want to leave.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Leave and go where?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Let me show you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: You okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Yeah. You?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, to be honest, Doc, I'm kinda wondering what the hell just happened up here.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: That makes two of us.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: So, you're the new Jacob, huh?  Feel any different?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Not really.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, Doc, how about you come down off the mountaintop and tell us what the hell the burning bush had to say for itself?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Jacob told me that we have to go to the bamboo forest out past our old camp. Just past it, well, said I'd find the place we need to protect.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: This place, what is it?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: He called it the heart of the island. All he said was that it's...it's a light.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: And that Locke Smoke Thing wants to put it out?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Something like that, yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: So, what if he does?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Then that's it for all of us.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: But, if Locke wants to put it out, then why hasn't he?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: 'Cause he ain't got what he needs. I'm guessing that'd be Desmond... That's where we were headed before your inauguration. Sayid said Locke tossed him in a well.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Jacob didn't say anything to me about Desmond.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Doesn't sound like he said anything about anything.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: That's kinda of true, dude. He's worse than Yoda.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: All right. Y'all head to your heart of the island and I'll go get the magic leprechaun out of that well.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: If I leave a trail, can you catch up with us?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Hell, yeah I can.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Then be safe.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: I'd ask you along, but that'd take all of the fun out me telling you, you can't come.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Uh, I guess I'll just have to resist the urge to follow you anyway.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: I've got a bad feeling about this.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAYID: I don't know why you got me out of prison, what you want or who you are. But, you understand, I can't be held responsible for--
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Yeah, yeah. Whatever, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: None of this is ringing a bell, is it? You me, tranquilizer gun?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAYID: You are insane.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Okay, fine. I'm insane. Just wait here.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAYID: What if I don't?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Then, that's your choice. But, if you stick with me...you'll be happy you did.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: "Do not disturb" sign... Who are you? Why you grinnin' like a sodding idiot?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Uh, you have a concert to perform tonight, and I'm here to pick you up.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: Didn't I make it clear to Widmore's other monkey? I don't care about a sodding concert.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Charlie? Charlie, what if I told you that...playing this show is the most important thing you'll ever do? Would you come then?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: Sod off.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Okay, dude. Sorry about this.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAYID: What was that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: That was Charlie.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Why did you take the job, Jack?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Because I was supposed to.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Why? Because some stranger wrote our names on a wall?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I took it because the island's all I’ve got left. It's the only thing in my life I haven't managed to ruin.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: You haven't ruined anything. Nothing is irreversible.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: This would be so sweet if we weren't all about to die.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: As long as you’re watching, why don't you join us?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: What are you doing here, James?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: I heard Desmond fell in the well, so I came to help him get out.  Looks like somebody beat us both to the punch. Oh well.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Do you know why I'm here?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: I'm guessing you need Desmond to destroy the island.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: That's absolutely right.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Then what, Smokey? You going down with the ship? Suicide doesn't seem like your style.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: I'm not going down with anything. But you and the rest of Jacob's little "candidates", absolutely are.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: We're not candidates anymore.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: Ahh! Ohh! Aah.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: I'll be seein' ya.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: You're not gonna go after him?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: I don't need to.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: When you said you were gonna destroy the island, I thought you were speaking figuratively.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Because I said I'd leave you in charge once I was gone? I'm sorry if I left out the part about the island being on the bottom of the ocean. That being said, you're welcome to join me on my boat. Because once we get Desmond to do, what we need him to do, I'm going to sail away from this godforsaken place and watch it sink.  I think there was a dog here.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 ROSE: Morning.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BERNARD: Morning. Sleep okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Aye. Your camp's a lot nicer than the bottom of a well.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BERNARD: I think I'm gonna go ahead and take that as a compliment.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 ROSE: Are you gonna talk his ear off or get the man some breakfast?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BERNARD: Guess I'll go check the traps for fish... Come on. Vincent. Let's go.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: So, Rose, tell me...how long have the two of you been living here?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 ROSE: Well, we built this place in '75 and lived here a couple of years and then the sky lit up again. So God only know when the hell we are now. So...Desmond...I don't mean to be rude, but after you eat, I'm gonna ask you to move on. We broke our rule with you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: What rule is that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 ROSE: We don't get involved. Whatever got you tossed inside the well...that's the kind of drama Bernard and I don't want to have anything to do with.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Fair enough.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 ROSE: Looks like you caught something.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BERNARD: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Hello, Rose...  I'll make this simple. Come with me now or I'll kill them both right in front of you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 ROSE: You don't have to go anywhere with him.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: I'll make it hurt.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: I want your word. You won't touch them--ever.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Done.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Then I'll do what you want.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Yes, Desmond. You will.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: You have any idea where I’m taking you, Desmond?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: No. But, I assume it's a place where there's a very bright light.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: What makes you say that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Oh. Just a hunch.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: What was that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: What was what?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Linus, can you hear me? Come in...I found Alpert.  Linus... Damn it! You okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: What--what--what happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: You thought it'd be a good idea to talk to the black smoke. It responded by throwing you into the damn jungle.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: Locke--L...is he still here?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: No...I've been trying to get Linus on the walkie, he won't pick up... Come on, let's get you some help.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: Help? Help? Help from where? You still have the explosives, the--the C-4?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Yeah. Why?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: Because we need to go the other island to finish what we started. We need to blow up that plane.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Detective Ford.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Jim, it's me...I think I just saw that Jarrah guy.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: You at county lockup?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: No, I'm at my dad's museum concert benefit thing.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Well, it can't be Jarrah. I just put him in a van to county an hour ago.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Really? Because I just called, and they said it never showed up.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Help me out here, Jim. Jarrah popped four people in cold blood. Only one witness left the scene alive, right? Some Korean woman. Can you make sure she's okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Yeah, yeah. Sun Paik. Gunshot wound. She's still over at the hospital. Enjoy your concert, Enos. I'll keep her safe.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JIN: 좀 어때? 
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SUN: 좀 쑤시네요. 
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JIN: 총 맞으면 다 그래.   아이가 괜찮은지 보러 의사가 곧 올거야. 아무 이상이 없으면 바로 떠나도 된대. 
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SUN: 떠나? 우리 어떻게 해요... 이렇게 아빠로부터 계속 도망쳐요?  
Lost.Season06.Episode16 WOMAN: Am I interrupting?  Hi...Miss Paik. I'm Juliet Carlson. I'm here to make sure your baby's okay. You must be the daddy.  I'm sorry. You don't speak English. I'm...I'll try not to talk too much.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Okay, you lift up your gown a little bit.  It's a little cold... Okay. Let's take a look.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: You okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JIN: 자기야, 괜찮아? 
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SUN: 나... 기억이 나. 
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JIN: 무슨 기억? 
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET:  There it is. There's your baby.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SUN: 당신 봤어요? 
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Do you see that little flutter? Right there? That's the baby's heartbeat. Perfectly perfect in every way. I have your amnio results. Everything checked out. Would you like to know if it's a boy or girl?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SUN: It's a girl.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Yeah.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JIN: Her name is Ji Yeon.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: That's a lovely name... And for the record, y-you two speak English just fine. Congratulations.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Whoa!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Easy, Bigfoot. It's just me...I found Locke. The son of a bitch said he's gonna destroy the island. You had it right, Doc. Good news is, Desmond got out of that well. So, if we can find him before Smokey can--
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: It doesn't matter if we find Desmond or he does, James. We're all going to the same place anyway.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Then what?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Then it ends.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Hello, Mr. Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Dr. Shephard. Hey, since you're about to open up my back, you can probably start calling me John.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Okay, John. I thought I'd stop by and say hi before we started the anesthesia. You nervous?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Are you sure this is going to work?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Yes. I'm very confident that it will.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Really?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Well, there's always the chance that I could kill you...but, I'm trying to make you feel better.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Okay. Okay, let's do it.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: All right. I'll see you on the other side.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Hey, Doctor, back at L.A.X. when we met at baggage claim, you mentioned that they had lost your father. Did he ever turn up?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: As a matter of fact, I got a phone call this morning. They, uh, they found the coffin.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Oh, good.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Actually, it might be here already.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Well, I hope that brings you some peace.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: If I can fix you, Mr. Locke, that's all the peace I'll need.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: It's gonna be a hell of a storm.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Welcome to the club. 
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Do you mind?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Looks like you got your first grey hair.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: What are you smiling about?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: I think I just realized that I wanna live.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Well, it's good timing.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: What was that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Help!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: Hey! Miles, up ahead!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Hey! Wha...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Get him some water.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: What are you guys doing out here?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: We're going to Hydra island to blow up the plane.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: What do you want to do that for?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: Because the black smoke wants to get off the island. We have to stop that thing from leaving.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Well, if we leave, that thing won't have a plane anymore.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: And how are we going to do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: In case you haven't noticed, I'm a pilot.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Well, this is gonna be interesting.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Kate! Kate!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: You killed them!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Kate! 
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: You might wanna save your bullets.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: So it's you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Yeah. It's me.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Jacob being who he is, I expected to be a little more surprised. You're sort of the obvious choice, don't you think?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: He didn't choose me. I volunteered.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: I assume you're here to stop me.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I can't stop you. In fact, I uh, wanna go with you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: I'm sorry, Jack. I think you're a little confused about what I came here to do.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: No I'm not. No, you're going to the far side of the bamboo forest. To the place that I've sworn that I'll protect. And then you think you're gonna destroy the Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE:  I think?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK:  That's right. Because that's not what's gonna happen.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Then what's gonna happen, Jack?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I'm gonna kill you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: How do you plan to do that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: That's a surprise.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Okay. Then let's get on with it.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Doctor.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK:  Doctor.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I didn't know you were working today.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: I just finished. Did you get the tickets for the concert?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Yep. Right here. 
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DAVID: Hey dad, did you remember the tickets?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I just gave 'em to your mom.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DAVID:  Uh, who's gonna take yours?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Well, if you don't have anybody else, maybe you could take aunt Claire. I'm sure she'd love to get out of the house.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Oh yeah, it's fine with me. In fact I'm very curious to meet this mysterious sister you never mentioned the entire time we were married.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Well, I'm sure you're gonna love her. She's extremely pregnant.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Good luck on your surgery, doctor.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Did you pick out a tie?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DAVID: I did.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Hi. I'm detective Ford, L.A.P.D.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RECEPTIONIST: M-hm.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: I'm looking for a patient's room. Sun Paik.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Something you wanna share with the rest of us, Doc?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: What's that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: You said you were gonna kill Locke. What's your surprise?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Desmond.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: How's that gonna work?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I'm not sure yet. I can't believe Jacob would have brought him all the way back to this Island just so Locke could make him destroy it.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: So, what, Desmond is bait?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: No. I think he's a weapon.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: That's a hell of a long con, Doc.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Jack, Desmond. It should just be the three of us from here on.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Jack. I believe in you, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE:  Gonna be a bad one.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: We're here.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: This doesn't matter, you know.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Him destroying the Island, you destroying him. It doesn't matter. You know, you're gonna lower me into that light, and I'm gonna go somewhere else. A place where we can be with the ones we love, and not have to ever think about this damn Island again. And you know the best part, Jack?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: You're in this place. You know, we sat next to each other on Oceanic 815. It never crashed. We spoke to each other. You seemed happy. You know, maybe I can find a way to bring you there too.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Desmond, I tried that once. There are no shortcuts, no do-overs. What happened, happened. Trust me, I know. All of this matters.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Shall we?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAYID: What are we doing here?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: I'm not allowed to tell you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAYID: What do you mean you're not allowed?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: There are rules, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAYID: Whose rules?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Don't worry about it. Just trust me, okay? I trust you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAYID: And what, may I ask, have I done to deserve your trust?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: I think you're a good guy, Sayid. You know, a lot of people have told you that you're not. Maybe you've heard it so many times you started believing it. You can't let other people tell you what you are, dude. You have to decide that for yourself.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAYID: I'm sorry. You clearly don't know anything about me.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: I know a lot about you, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Looks like a gnarly fight.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SHANNON: Hey, leave my brother alone.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAYID: Hey, it's alright.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SHANNON: Sayid.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAYID: Shannon.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BOONE: I just got pounded, man. Thanks for taking your sweet time.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: It takes as long as it takes.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BOONE: It was a pain in the ass getting her here from Australia.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Yeah, but dude, it was worth it.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BOONE: Should I go get 'em?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Nah, let's give 'em a minute.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Linus, are you there?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: What the hell is that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: Miles, where are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: We just got to Hydra Island. We're on our way to the plane.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: Miles, listen to me. Whatever you do, don't blow up that plane.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: We're not gonna blow it up, we're gonna fly it the hell off the Island. Just get over here now.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK:  What in the hell?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Claire.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE:  Miles, it's Kate. Did you say Claire? Is she okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Put the gun down.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Don't come any closer!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Miles? Miles, what happened? Miles, are you there?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: He sent you here to kill me, didn't he?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: No, listen. We're not with Locke.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE:  Why should I believe you?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: Because we have a real chance to get far far away from him. We can be free from everything he ever did to us, and never look back. We can go home.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: Will you come with us, Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE:  No. 
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: All right we...we lower him down nice and easy.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: You know what to do once you get down there?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Aye. I go where the light's brightest.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Don't get yourself killed.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: This remind you of anything, Jack?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Desmond...going down into a hole in the ground. If there was a button down there to push, we could fight about whether or not to push it. It'd be just like old times.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: You're not John Locke. You disrespect his memory by wearing his face, but you're nothing like him. Turns out he was right about most everything. I just wish I could've told him that while he was still alive.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: He wasn't right about anything, Jack. And when this island drops into the ocean, and you drop with it, you're finally gonna realize that.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Well, we'll just have to see which one of us is right, then.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Oh...it's the hospital
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DAVID: Go ahead. I'm sure it's important.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: I'm so sorry. I'll be back as soon as I can. 
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DAVID: I know. It's cool. Go.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET:  We'll get to know each other better, I hope?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Yeah, yeah, sure... Well, I, uh, I guess it's just you and me, kid.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLOTTE: Oi... Wake up. Wake up. Come on. Wake up.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: Hey, What you doin'?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLOTTE: I'm just following the instructions... You're in the band, aren't you?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: How do you know that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: Oh...I was shot by a fat man.  It's all right.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLOTTE:  Excuse me... Hey, excuse me. Do you know where the band is?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DANIEL:  I'm sorry. Uh, pardon me?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLOTTE:  I-I think he's in the band.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DANIEL: Yes, yes. Of course. He’s the bass player from Drive Shaft. They're accompanying me tonight. I play piano...I'm Daniel. Daniel Widmore.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLOTTE: I'm Charlotte.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DANIEL: It's a great pleasure to meet you, Charlotte.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLOTTE: You, too.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Well, lead the way.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DAVID: Excuse me. Is this table 23?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Aye, indeed it is.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Claire.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: I...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: You two know each other?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MAN ON MICROPHONE: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. May I have your attention, please? Welcome to this very special benefit concert for the Golden State Natural History Museum. I'm Dr. Pierre Chang.  Thank you. I think we have quite a special evening ahead of us.  So, let's get to it, shall we? It is my pleasure to introduce you to Mr. Daniel Widmore accompanied by Drive Shaft.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Mm.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DAVID: You okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Yeah, yeah. I'm just--I'm just gonna use the bathroom. I'll--I'll be right back...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Aah! Aah! Aah!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Uhh!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: No! No!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: It looks like...you were wrong... Goodbye, Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Uhh!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK:  Looks like you were wrong, too.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Oh, hello. Hello?  Hi, uh, do you know where the bathroom is?  Umm. Oh.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE:  Uh, can you please get a doctor?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE:  Small world, huh?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Yeah, well, what are you doing--mm! Oh!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE:  Oh! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Come on. Sit down.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Um, I-I think he's coming.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 ELOISE: I thought I made it clear that you were to stop this.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Perfectly clear. I chose to ignore  you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 ELOISE: And once they know...what then?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: We're leaving.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 ELOISE: Are you going to take my son?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Not with me...no.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Uhh!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Just breathe, okay? Just breathe, breathe, breathe. Help is on the way.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Mnh-mnh! It's hap--it's happening. Like--like, right now.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Right now... Um. Okay. I'm...I'm gonna get you comfortable. I want you to relax and breathe, all right? Just relax and breathe.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Who are you?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: I'm with the band.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Uhh!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE:  Listen, can you get us some water and blankets, please?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: Water and blankets?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Yeah.  All right. Uh...this is about the time when you're supposed to start pushing
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: I'm not ready. I'm really scared.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: I'm scared too, all right? Really scared. But I'm gonna need you to push because I can't do it without you. Okay? Okay? One, two, three. Push!  Good, that's good. Okay, we’re gonna try again. You’re doin' good. One, two, three. Push!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Push, push again.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Oh!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Shh... It's Aaron. It's...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: I brought a blanket.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: It's just a blanket.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Then go ahead and bring it to her.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: Couldn't find any water.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Charlie.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: Claire? Claire.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHARLIE: Hi, Aaron. Hey. Shh. It's okay... Hey, Aaron.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Do you understand?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: So now what?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: Hugo, get out the way!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: Ohh!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Desmond!  Desmond!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE:  We're gonna get you out of here, all right?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: It's too damn heavy. There's no way we're gettin' it off him.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: We have to try.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: One...two...three!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: What is happening?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: I'll tell you what's happening! Locke was right! This Island's goin' down!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Linus, come in! Linus, come in! Linus, come in! Come in!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Miles. Is that you?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Yeah. What the hell is happening?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Are you with Claire?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: She's here, but she doesn't want to come with us.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Come with you where?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Lapidus is working on the plane right now. Then we’re taking off... Hey, how much longer 'til we get this thing in the air?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LAPIDUS: I still have to check the electrical and the hydraulics. Five hours, maybe six.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: You've got maybe one.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Get your asses over here! We're leaving in an hour!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Son of a bitch! How the hell are we supposed to get over there?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: I know how we can get there! Locke has a boat.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: LOCKE!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: I want you to know Jack, you died for nothing!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: I saved you a bullet!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: You're too late.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 NURSE: Nice work, Dr. Shephard. What happened to your neck?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK:  Damn it.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: OK, he's stable. I'm gonna hop in the shower and see if I can catch up with David before the concert's over. Just give me a call if you need me.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 NURSE: Dr. Shephard? He's waking up. I watched the anesthesiologist...he got the full dosage.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: OK. I'll take it from here. Mr. Locke. Can you hear me? John, are you awake?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: You just had major surgery so I need you to try not to move and just relax, OK?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: It worked.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Uh...it went well...but we wont know how you responded to the surgery--
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: No, Dr. Shephard, it worked. I can feel my legs.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: John, it's highly unlikely that you would regain sensation that quickly so lets just take it slo--
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE:  Oh.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Oh. Did you see that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: See what?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: You don't remember?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Um... Mr. Locke  Please just, ah, just relax. What we need to do...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: What we need to do is go...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: No, no, no...hey. John...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Will you come with me?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: We're not going anywhere. You just had extensive spinal surgery and I...I need to see my son.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: You don't have a son.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK:  What?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: You don't have a son, Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 NURSE:  Doctor?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Jean, um, would you give Mr. Locke something to help him rest? I need to go.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Jack...I hope that somebody does for you what you just did for me.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Oh my god.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Ahh.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Jack...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I'm fine. Just find me some thread and I can count to five.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Hey! Oh my god. What the hell happened?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Locke's dead...it's over.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Sure don't feel like it's over.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Excuse me, Miss...Paik?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SUN: Yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Hi. I'm Detective Ford, LAPD. I'm sorry I heard you were shot, I didn't expect you to be checking out so soon.  Hey.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JIN: Hello. Detective.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Well I came by to check if you've seen this man.  He escaped custody, and we're worried he might come after you. I'm gonna assign a uniform to keep an eye on you until we can app--
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SUN: You don't have to do that.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: All due respect, I have a job to do here ma'am. I need to keep you safe.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SUN: It's okay, I am safe.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JIN: We'll see you there.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: See me where?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Alright. It ain't pretty, but it's gonna work. Gotta reset the electronics.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Something's wrong with the hydraulics down at the nose wheel. You know any guys mechanical? Yeah?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Well, I--I worked for a--a contractor renovating apartments for a couple of summers--
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK:  Take that! And this, and this.  Go down there and make sure everything's hooked up right. Go!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN:  Lapidus?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Yeah?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: Frank, how's it going over there? What's your timetable?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Don't bother me!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: Sounds like they're making progress.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: We gotta go now.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: I don't understand. Locke's dead, why is this still happening?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Because whatever Desmond turned off...I need to turn it back on again. But if it doesn't work, if I don't get it done you all need to leave now. You need to get on that plane.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: You can come with us too, Jack. You don't have to do this.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: No I do have to do this.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: No, you don't! Let the Island sink, Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Kate...I can't.  You think you can get that boat across the channel in time?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Yeah, I can manage.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Good luck to you, James.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Thanks, doc...for everything.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: James!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: If the Island's going down, I'm going down with it.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Hugo, you better get going.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Uh-uh, no way. You think I'm going down that? I'm with you, dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Okay. Kate...you gotta go. Get Claire on that plane.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Tell me I'm gonna see you again.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: I love you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I love you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: Can you fix it?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: I don't believe in a lot of things but I do believe in duct tape. Yeah, I think we're good.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Let's get the hell out of here.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER:  Yo Chesty, Sawyer and Kate...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: Yeah?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: We're on our way down to the sailboat then we're heading to you...don't leave without us.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LAPIDUS: We're getting off the ground while there's still ground to get off. So if you wanna go you better get your asses in gear.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Lapidus! Lapidus! Son of a bitch.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: What now?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: We jump.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: I'll see you at the boat.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Kate!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Hey, you know where I could get some grub around here?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Uhh... the cafeteria's closed, but there's a vending machine down the hallway.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Thanks, doc.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Yeah, no problem.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Oh, come on...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Unbelievable.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Can I help you?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: It's okay... I'm a... I'm a cop.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Mmmm. Maybe you should read the machine its rights?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER:  That's funny.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Mmmm... Can I tell you a secret?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Please.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: If you unplug it, and then you plug it back in again... the candy just drops right down.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Is that right?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Yes, and it's technically legal.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Oh... give that a shot...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Oops...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: It worked.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Oh...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Whoa... did you feel that?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: We should get coffee some time.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: I'd love to but the machine ate my dollar, I only got one left.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: We can go dutch.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Juliet? Juliet it's--it's me. Ju--
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: It's me babe... I gotcha... I gotcha babe.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JULIET: Kiss me, James!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: You got it blondie...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: It's over.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Excuse me?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: The concert. It's over. You lookin' for someone?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Yeah, my son. I was supposed to bring him here tonight, and then... I couldn't come, and...
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I'm sorry, where do I remember you from?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: I stole your pen.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Uh... Oceanic 815, from Sydney? I bumped into you coming out of the bathroom, and I stole your pen.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: And that's how I know you?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: No... that's not how you know me.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: I missed you so much.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Are you okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: What is happening to me? Wh--who are you? I don't--
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: I know, you don't understand Jack. But if you come with me... you will.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: It's over there.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: How are we getting down there?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: We're not, I'm going alone.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Dude, you can't go down there alone. If Desmond didn't make it, how the hell are you going to survive?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: No. No way, I'm not gonna let you die.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Hurley, I'm already dead.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: You said you'd protect the Island!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: And that's what I'm doing.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: You're committing suicide!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I'm not, this is the way it has to happen! This is what I'm supposed to do.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: You're not supposed to die! The Island needs you!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Hurley... it needs you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: What?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: It needs to be you, Hugo.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY:  I can't... it's supposed to be you!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: It was only supposed to be me so I can do this. But if someone has to take care of the Island, if someone has to protect it then... then it should be you. Hurley... I believe in you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Alright I'll take it. But it's only temporary, as soon as you get that light back in, I'm pulling you up, and I'm giving it right back to you, deal?!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Deal.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Do you have anything to drink? Anything to drink out of... uh... a cup, a canteen?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: I do.  Is that okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: It's perfect.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK:  Drink this.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Is that it?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK:  Now you're like me.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Second time's a charm. It better be because we sure as hell don't have the battery power for a third time.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: That good?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: That my friends, is pure music!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Easy. Easy. Easy.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Ah, ahh.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Desmond! Desmond? Can you hear me?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: The light... I put it out. It didn't work. I thought I'd leave this place.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I got you. Come on. Come on.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: I'm still here. You were right Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Well, there's a first time for everything.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: I have to put it back. It was like a drain.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: That's what you did, you took that stone out of that hole over there?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: Jack you can't, even if you turn it back on it'll kill you. It has to be me!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Desmond, you've done enough. You wanna do something? Go home and be with your wife and son.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 DESMOND: What about you, Jack?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I'll see you in another life, brother.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Claire?!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Oh, that ain't good.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Miles, go look out the door! You gotta be my eyes while I back this outta here! Richard, go tell me what he says!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Claire! Are you okay?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Come on, we gotta go! Come on!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Claire, come on please!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: I can't!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Why?!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CLAIRE: Look at me! This Island's made me crazy, I--I don't want Aaron to see me like this. I don't even know how to be a mother anymore.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Listen to me, none of us do. Not at first. But you're not alone. Let me help you. Come on, let's go.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Are we clear?!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD:  Are we clear?!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Yeah looks like it to me!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD:  He says we're good!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: You better pray we are Ricky boy, because I'm gonna spin her around! Hold on!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Sawyer! Tell him to stop! Tell him we're coming!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER:  Lapidus! Lapidus! Lapidus, hold on!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Alright, we're good to go!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Let's go!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: What the hell? Boys we got some late arrivals, open the door. Come on!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: We're running out of time!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 MILES: Way to wait until the last second, Jim.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 SAWYER: Good to see you too, Enos.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 RICHARD: We got 'em!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Everybody buckle up tight! Hold on!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Here we go, Frank.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Come on. Come on.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 FRANK: Amen.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: He did it, the light's back on.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Dude, pull!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Hang on, Jack!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Got him...Desmond? No...Jack! Jack!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Thank you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Hello Benjamin.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: Hello John.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Is everyone already inside?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: I believe most of them are, yes.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: I'm very sorry for what I did to you John. I was selfish, jealous. I wanted everything you had.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: What did I have?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: You were special, John... and I wasn't.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Well if it helps, Ben, I forgive you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: Thank you, John...that does help. It matters more than I can say.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: What are you gonna do now?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: I have some things I still need to work out. I think I'll stay here a while.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: You know, I don't think you need to be in that chair anymore.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 LOCKE: Goodbye, Ben.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: I think Desmond's gonna be okay.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Jack's...gone...isn't he?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: He did his job, Hugo.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: It's my job now... What the hell am I supposed to do?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: I think you do what you do best. Take care of people. You can start by helping Desmond get home.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: But how? People can't leave the Island.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: That's how Jacob ran things... Maybe there's another way. A better way.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Will you help me?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: I'm sorry?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: I could really use someone with like, experience. For a little while. Will you help me, Ben?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: I'd be honored.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Cool.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Oh, hey dude.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: Hello, Hugo!
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: We're all inside.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: I don't think I'm coming in.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: You know, you were a real good number two.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 BEN: And you were a great number one, Hugo.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 HURLEY: Thanks, dude. I'll see ya.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Do you know where we are?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: This is where I was gonna have my father's funeral. He died, in Australia.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: I'm sorry.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Why did you bring me here?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Because this is where you were gonna have your father's funeral. You can go in around back.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Wait, where you going?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: Inside. I'll be waiting for you there, once you're ready.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Ready for what?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 KATE: To leave.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 VOICE: Hey, kiddo.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Dad?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: Hello, Jack.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I don't understand...you died.

Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: I love you, dad.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: I love you too, son.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: You...are you real?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: I should hope so. Yeah, I'm real. You're real, everything that's ever happened to you is real. All those people in the church...they're real too.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: They're all...they're all dead?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: Everyone dies sometime, kiddo. Some of them before you, some...long after you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: But why are they all here now?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: Well there is no "now" here.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Where are we, dad?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: This is the place that you...that you all made together, so that you could find one another. The most...important part of your life, was the time that you spent with these people. That's why all of you are here. Nobody does it alone Jack. You needed all of them, and they needed you.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: For what?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: To remember...and to...let go.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Kate...she said we were leaving.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHRISTIAN: Not leaving, no. Moving on.
Lost.Season06.Episode16 JACK: Where are we going?
Lost.Season06.Episode16 CHRISTIAN:  Let's go find out.

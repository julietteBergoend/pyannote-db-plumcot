ticket_agent However , the airline has a policy that a man of your size must purchase two tickets .

hugo_reyes Does that mean something to you ?
kate_austen What ?
hugo_reyes That number ?

kate_austen The guy who called the Feds on me , back in Australia , did it for a 23,000 dollar reward .
kate_austen Mean something to you ?
hugo_reyes Nah , it's just a number .
hugo_reyes We better catch up -- can barely see them .
john_locke We shouldn't be this close to each other , Jack .
dr_jack_shephard If we blow up , we blow up .
dr_jack_shephard What the hell was all that about back there , John ?
john_locke What was what about ?
dr_jack_shephard You asked me to let you go .
john_locke That's right .
dr_jack_shephard That thing was taking you down the hole and you asked me to let you go .
john_locke It wasn't going to hurt me .
dr_jack_shephard No , John , it was going to kill you .
john_locke I seriously doubt that .
dr_jack_shephard Look , I need for you -- I need for you to explain to me what the hell's going on inside your head , John .
dr_jack_shephard I need to know why you believe that that thing wasn't gonna-
john_locke I believe that I was being tested .
dr_jack_shephard Tested ?
john_locke Yeah , tested .
john_locke I think that's why you and I don't see eye-to-eye sometimes , Jack -- because you're a man of science .
dr_jack_shephard Yeah , and what does that make you ?
john_locke Me , well , I'm a man of faith .
john_locke Do you really think all this is an accident -- that we , a group of strangers survived , many of us with just superficial injuries ?
john_locke Do you think we crashed on this place by coincidence -- especially , this place ?
john_locke We were brought here for a purpose , for a reason , all of us .
john_locke Each one of us was brought here for a reason .
dr_jack_shephard Brought here ?
dr_jack_shephard And who brought us here , John ?
john_locke The Island .
john_locke The Island brought us here .
john_locke This is no ordinary place , you've seen that , I know you have .
john_locke But the Island chose you , too , Jack .
john_locke It's destiny .
dr_jack_shephard Did you talk with Boone about destiny , John ?
john_locke Boone was a sacrifice that the Island demanded .
john_locke What happened to him at that plane was a part of a chain of events that led us here --
john_locke that led us down a path --
john_locke that led you and me to this day , to right now .
dr_jack_shephard And where does that path end , John ?
john_locke The path ends at the Hatch .
john_locke The Hatch , Jack -- all of it -- all of it happened so that we could open the Hatch .
dr_jack_shephard No , no , we're opening the Hatch so that we can survive .
john_locke Survival is all relative , Jack .
dr_jack_shephard I don't believe in destiny .
john_locke Yes , you do .
john_locke You just don't know it yet .
michael_dawson I turned it on a little while ago .
james_ford Sayid said every hour .
michael_dawson Look , we're 15 miles out .
michael_dawson We could be here for weeks .
michael_dawson If that battery runs out ...
james_ford The man said every hour .
james_ford Nothing .
michael_dawson 5 minutes , no more .
james_ford Aye , aye .
james_ford You know what I like about you , Mike ?
james_ford You've got the patience of a saint .
michael_dawson Yeah ?
michael_dawson Why do you say that ?
james_ford I've seen the way he talks to you -- the way he runs around , does whatever the hell he wants .
james_ford I'd have showed him the back of my hand a long time ago .
michael_dawson You would , huh ?
james_ford A hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink .
michael_dawson Is that what your father did to you ?
michael_dawson Show you the back of his hand ?
james_ford My daddy never got a chance to beat me .
james_ford He shot himself when I was 8 .
michael_dawson Is that why you want to die , man ?
james_ford What ?
michael_dawson Since the day you told me you wanted on this raft , I couldn't figure it out .
michael_dawson Why does a guy who only cares about himself want to risk his life to save everyone else ?
michael_dawson The way I see it
michael_dawson , there's only two choices -- you're either a hero or you want to die .
james_ford Well , I ain't no hero , Mike .
james_ford Is that what I think it is ?
michael_dawson Something's out there .
gate_attendant I'm sorry , sir , but the special wheelchair that we use for loading the disabled passengers --
gate_attendant well , no one seems to know where it is right now .
gate_attendant And unless we find it , I'm not sure we can get you on .
john_locke There's not another flight until tomorrow .
gate_attendant Yes , I'm aware of that , sir , but there's nothing I can ...
flight_attendant_2 Look , I can get Michelle , we can carry him on .
flight_attendant_2 Would you mind if we carry you on ?
john_locke No , that'll be fine .
flight_attendant_3 Here we go .
flight_attendant_3 Here's your seat .
flight_attendant_2 I'll get your bag , sir .
flight_attendant_3 If you need anything just press the call button .
john_locke Okay .
john_locke Thank you .
john_locke Hugo , take these extra sticks back a couple hundred yards .
hugo_reyes Me ?
hugo_reyes Oh , okay .
hugo_reyes Got it .
dr_jack_shephard Be careful .
hugo_reyes Can I have the flashlight ?
hugo_reyes Because , uh , the torch with the dynamite thing , not making a whole lot of sense to me .
john_locke Kate , you run the fuse , Jack and I will rig the charges .
kate_austen Okay .
charlie_pace What the hell is that ?
sayid_jarrah There's no footprints , no tracks .
charlie_pace This is it ?
charlie_pace This is the black smoke ?
charlie_pace Where are they ?
sayid_jarrah I don't know .
charlie_pace She's here .
sayid_jarrah Danielle !
charlie_pace You come out , right now !
sayid_jarrah Calm down .
sayid_jarrah Danielle !
sayid_jarrah I can hear you , come out .
sayid_jarrah Please , he needs his mother .
danielle_rousseau They were not here .
sayid_jarrah Danielle , you have to give us the baby .
danielle_rousseau I just wanted my Alex back .
danielle_rousseau I thought if I gave them the baby ...
sayid_jarrah It's okay .
sayid_jarrah I know .
sayid_jarrah It's okay .
charlie_pace I've got him .
charlie_pace There never were any Others .
charlie_pace You started the fires yourself !
danielle_rousseau No , I heard them whispering .
charlie_pace You're a nut job .
charlie_pace You heard nothing !
danielle_rousseau I heard them say they were coming for the child .
danielle_rousseau The Others said they were coming for the boy .
charlie_pace You're pathetic .
john_locke Wire .
john_locke Hold that end .
john_locke Now the fuse .
dr_jack_shephard I'll do it .
kate_austen This is as far as it goes .
john_locke It's far enough .
john_locke I'll light it .
john_locke You take cover , there'll be enough burn time for me to get clear .
dr_jack_shephard Hurley !
hugo_reyes Wait just a sec .
kate_austen So , what was that about back there ?
dr_jack_shephard What was what about ?
kate_austen Putting the dynamite in your pack .
dr_jack_shephard I made a judgment call .
kate_austen We drew straws .
dr_jack_shephard Sorry , I'm not going to let drawing straws make decisions like that for us , Kate .
kate_austen You had no right to make that choice ...
dr_jack_shephard Everybody wants me to be a leader until I make a decision that they don't like .
dr_jack_shephard You want to keep second guessing me , Kate ?
dr_jack_shephard That's your call .
dr_jack_shephard There's something that you need to know -- if we survive this , if we survive tonight -- we're going to have a Locke problem .
dr_jack_shephard And I have to know that you've got my back .
kate_austen I've got your back .
john_locke Are we ready ?
hugo_reyes Wait a sec , wait a sec .

c3po  Did you hear that?
c3po They shut down the main reactor.
c3po We'll be destroyed for sure.
c3po This is madness.
c3po We're doomed.
c3po There'll be no escape for the princess this time.
c3po What's that?
c3po R2-D2, where are you?
c3po At last!
c3po Where have you been?
c3po They're heading in this direction.
luke_skywalker What are we going to do?
c3po We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel, smashed into who knows what!
luke_skywalker Wait a minute.
luke_skywalker Where are you going?
imperial_officer The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
darth_vader Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
darth_vader What have you done with those plans?
rebel#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We intercepted no transmissions.
rebel#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 This is a consular ship.
rebel#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We're on a diplomatic mission.
darth_vader If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador?
darth_vader Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans, and bring me the passengers!
darth_vader I want them alive!
grand_moff_tarkin There's one.
clone_trooper Set for stun.
clone_trooper She'll be all right.
clone_trooper Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
luke_skywalker Hey!
c3po You're not permitted in there.
c3po It's restricted.
c3po You'll be deactivated for sure.
c3po Don't you call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!
c3po Now come out before somebody sees you.
c3po Secret mission?
c3po What plans?
luke_skywalker What are you talking about?
c3po I'm not getting in there.
c3po I'm going to regret this.
chief_pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 There goes another one.
captain_raymus_antilles Hold your fire.
captain_raymus_antilles There's no life-forms.
captain_raymus_antilles It must have short-circuited.
luke_skywalker That's funny.
c3po The damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
c3po Are you sure this thing is safe?
han_solo Oh.
leia Only you could be so bold.
grand_moff_tarkin The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
darth_vader You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
darth_vader Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.
darth_vader I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
leia I don't know what you're talking about.
leia I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
darth_vader You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.
darth_vader Take her away!
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Holding her is dangerous.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.
darth_vader I've traced the rebel spies to her.
darth_vader Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 She'll die before she'll tell you anything.
darth_vader Leave that to me.
darth_vader Send a distress signal, and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed.
senator Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship, and no transmissions were made.
senator An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life-forms were aboard.
darth_vader She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.
darth_vader Send a detachment down to retrieve them- See to it personally, Commander.
c3po There'll be no one to stop us this time.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Yes, sir.
c3po How did we get into this mess?
c3po I really don't know how.
c3po We seem to be made to suffer.
c3po It's our lot in life.
c3po I've got to rest before I fall apart.
c3po My joints are almost frozen.
c3po What a desolate place this is!
luke_skywalker Where do you think you're going?
c3po Well, I'm not going that way.
c3po It's much too rocky.
c3po This way is much easier.
c3po What makes you think there are settlements over there?
c3po Don't get technical with me.
c3po What mission?
luke_skywalker What are you talking about?
c3po I've just about had enough of you.
c3po Go that way.
c3po You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile.
c3po And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.
c3po No more adventures.
c3po I'm not going that way.
c3po That malfunctioning little twerp.
c3po This is all his fault.
c3po He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.
red_three_ Wait!
c3po What's that?
c3po A transport.
c3po I'm saved!
c3po Over here!
luke_skywalker Hey!
c3po Help!
c3po Please help!
c3po It is you!
clone_trooper Someone was in the pod.
c3po The tracks go off in this direction.
SECOND_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Look, sir, droids.
c3po Wake up!
c3po Wake up!
c3po We're doomed.
c3po Do you think they'll melt us down?
c3po Don't shoot!
c3po Don't shoot!
c3po Will this never end?
luke_skywalker All right, fine.
aunt_beru Luke!
aunt_beru Luke!
aunt_beru Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.
uncle_owen Yeah, we'll take that red one.
luke_skywalker No, not that one.
c3po Of course you haven't, sir.
uncle_owen That is why I have been programmed- What I really need is a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
c3po Vaporators?
c3po Sir, my firstjob was programming binary load lifters, very similar to your vaporators in most respects.
uncle_owen Can you speak Bocce?
red_three_ Of course I can, sir.
c3po It's like a second language to me- Yeah, all right.
uncle_owen I'll take this one.
aunt_beru Luke!
uncle_owen Take these two over to the garage, will you?
uncle_owen I want them cleaned up before dinner.
luke_skywalker But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters.
uncle_owen You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.
clone_trooper All right.
luke_skywalker Come on.
luke_skywalker And the red one.
luke_skywalker Come on.
luke_skywalker Well, come on, red.
luke_skywalker Uncle Owen!
uncle_owen Yeah?
luke_skywalker This R2 unit has a bad motivator.
luke_skywalker Look.
uncle_owen Hey, what are you trying to push on us?
c3po Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition, a real bargain.
luke_skywalker Uncle Owen, what about that one?
luke_skywalker What about that blue one?
uncle_owen We'll take that one.
darth_vader Take this away.
c3po You'll be very pleased with that one, sir.
c3po He really is in first-class condition.
c3po I've worked with him before.
c3po Here he comes.
c3po Now, don't you forget this.
c3po Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity.
luke_skywalker Thank the maker!
c3po This oil bath is going to feel so good.
c3po I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move.
luke_skywalker Itjust isn't fair.
luke_skywalker Oh, Biggs is right.
luke_skywalker I'm never gonna get out of here.
c3po Is there anything I might do to help?
leia No.
luke_skywalker Not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock.
c3po I don't think so, sir.
c3po I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things, not on this planet, anyway.
c3po As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
luke_skywalker Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
c3po I see, sir.
luke_skywalker You can call me Luke.
c3po I see, Sir Luke.
red_three_ Just Luke.
rebel#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 This is my counterpart R2-D2.
luke_skywalker Hello.
luke_skywalker You got a lot of carbon scoring.
luke_skywalker Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
c3po With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the rebellion and all.
luke_skywalker You know of the rebellion against the Empire?
c3po 
c3po !
c3po That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
luke_skywalker Have you been in many battles?
c3po Several, I think.
c3po Actually, there's not much to tell.
c3po I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories.
c3po Well, not at making them interesting, anyway.
luke_skywalker Well, my little friend, you got something jammed in here real good.
leia You're my only hope.
c3po What's this?
c3po "What is what"?
c3po He asked you a question.
c3po What is that?
leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
leia You're my only hope.
leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
leia You're my only hope.
c3po Old data.
c3po Pay it no mind.
luke_skywalker Who is she?
luke_skywalker She's beautiful.
c3po I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
c3po I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.
c3po A person of some importance, I believe.
c3po Behave yourself, R2.
c3po You're going to get us into trouble.
clone_trooper It's all right.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You can trust him.
c3po He's our new master.
c3po He says that he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts, and it's a private message for him.
leia Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.
c3po But with all we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
leia Obi-Wan Kenobi.
luke_skywalker I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.
c3po I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
luke_skywalker I don't know any Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.
luke_skywalker He's kind of a strange old hermit.
leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
luke_skywalker I wonder who she is.
c3po Sounds like she's in trouble.
luke_skywalker I better play back the whole thing.
r2d2 [Beep!
r2d2 Beep!
c3po 
c3po ]He says the restraining bolt has short-circuited his recording system.
c3po He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
luke_skywalker Oh, yeah.
luke_skywalker Well I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off.
c3po There you go.
luke_skywalker Wait a minute.
clone_trooper Where'd she go?
luke_skywalker Bring her back.
luke_skywalker Play back the entire message.
c3po "What message"?
c3po The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards.
aunt_beru Luke!
aunt_beru Luke!
luke_skywalker All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
c3po I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
luke_skywalker See what you can do with him.
luke_skywalker I'll be right back.
c3po Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
c3po No, I don't think he likes you at all.
c3po No, I don't like you, either.
luke_skywalker You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
c3po What makes you think that?
luke_skywalker Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.
luke_skywalker He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
luke_skywalker I thought he might have meant old Ben.
leia Do you know what he's talking about?
luke_skywalker I wonder if he's related to Ben.
uncle_owen That wizard's just a crazy old man.
uncle_owen Tomorrow, I want you to take that R2 unit to Anchorhead and have its memory erased.
uncle_owen That'll be the end of it.
uncle_owen It belongs to us now.
luke_skywalker But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
uncle_owen He won't.
c3po I don't think he exists anymore.
uncle_owen He died about the same time as your father.
luke_skywalker He knew my father?
captain_raymus_antilles I told you to forget it.
uncle_owen Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow.
uncle_owen In the morning, I want them up there on the south ridge working on those condensers.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Yes, sir.
luke_skywalker I think those new droids are gonna work out fine.
luke_skywalker In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about me staying on another season?
luke_skywalker And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the academy this year.
uncle_owen You mean the next semester before the harvest?
luke_skywalker Sure.
luke_skywalker There's more than enough droids.
uncle_owen Harvest is when I need you the most.
uncle_owen It's only one season more.
uncle_owen You must understand I need you here, Luke.
luke_skywalker But it's a whole 'nother year!
uncle_owen Look, it's only one more season.
luke_skywalker Yeah, that's what you said when Biggs and Tank left.
luke_skywalker Where are you going?
luke_skywalker Looks like I'm going nowhere.
luke_skywalker I have to go finish cleaning those droids.
aunt_beru Owen, he can't stay here forever.
aunt_beru Most of his friends have gone.
aunt_beru It means so much to him.
uncle_owen I'll make it up to him next year.
uncle_owen I promise.
aunt_beru Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
aunt_beru He has too much of his father in him.
uncle_owen That's what I'm afraid of.
c3po What are you doing hiding back there?
c3po It wasn't my fault, sir.
c3po Please don't deactivate me.
c3po I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning.
luke_skywalker Oh, no.
luke_skywalker That R2 unit has always been a problem.
c3po These astro droids are getting quite out of hand.
c3po Even I can't understand their logic at times.
luke_skywalker How could I be so stupid?
luke_skywalker He's nowhere in sight.
luke_skywalker Blast it!
c3po Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
luke_skywalker It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around.
luke_skywalker We'll have to wait until morning.
luke_skywalker Uncle Owen: Luke!
uncle_owen I'm shutting the power down.
clone_trooper All right!
luke_skywalker I'll be there in a few minutes.
luke_skywalker Boy, am I gonna get it.
luke_skywalker That little droid's going to cause me a lotta trouble.
c3po Oh, he excels at that, sir.
luke_skywalker Come on.
aunt_beru Luke?
aunt_beru Luke!
uncle_owen Have you seen Luke this morning?
aunt_beru He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.
uncle_owen Did he take those two new droids with him?
aunt_beru I think so.
uncle_owen Well, he better have those units in the south range repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay.
luke_skywalker Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.
luke_skywalker Where do you think you're going?
c3po Master Luke is your rightful owner now.
c3po You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here!
leia No.
luke_skywalker What's wrong with him now?
c3po There are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
luke_skywalker Come on.
luke_skywalker Come on!
luke_skywalker They're Sandpeople, all right.
luke_skywalker I can see one of them now.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Hello, there.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Come here, my little friend.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Don't be afraid.
grand_moff_tarkin Oh, don't worry.
clone_trooper He'll be all right.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You're fortunate to be all in one piece.
luke_skywalker Ben?
luke_skywalker Ben Kenobi?
luke_skywalker Boy, am I glad to see you.
ben_obiwan_kenobi The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?
luke_skywalker This little droid.
luke_skywalker He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
luke_skywalker Is he a relative of yours?
leia Do you know who he's talking about?
leia Obi-Wan Kenobi?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Obi-Wan.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Now, that's a name I've not heard in a long time.
ben_obiwan_kenobi A long time.
luke_skywalker I think my uncle knows him.
luke_skywalker He said he was dead.
clone_trooper Oh, he's not dead.
luke_skywalker You know him?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Well, of course I know him.
ben_obiwan_kenobi He's me.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan since, oh, before you were born.
luke_skywalker Well, then the droid does belong to you.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Very interesting.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I think we better get indoors.
ben_obiwan_kenobi The Sandpeople are easily startled, but they'll soon be back, and in greater numbers.
c3po Where am I?
c3po I must have taken a bad step.
luke_skywalker Can you stand?
luke_skywalker We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.
c3po I don't think I can make it.
c3po You go on, Master Luke.
c3po There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.
c3po I'm done for.
luke_skywalker No, you're not.
luke_skywalker What kind of talk is that?
leia They're on the move.
luke_skywalker No, my father didn't fight in the wars.
luke_skywalker He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
ben_obiwan_kenobi That's what your uncle told you.
ben_obiwan_kenobi He didn't hold with your father's ideals.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
luke_skywalker You fought in the Clone Wars?
grand_moff_tarkin Yes.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father.
luke_skywalker I wish I'd known him.
ben_obiwan_kenobi He was the best starpilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.
ben_obiwan_kenobi And he was a good friend.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Which reminds me, I have something here for you.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
ben_obiwan_kenobi He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
c3po Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for a while.
luke_skywalker Sure.
c3po What is it?
ben_obiwan_kenobi It's your father's lightsaber.
ben_obiwan_kenobi This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.
ben_obiwan_kenobi An elegant weapon for a more civilized age.
ben_obiwan_kenobi For over a thousand generations, the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic, before the dark times, before the Empire.
luke_skywalker How did my father die?
ben_obiwan_kenobi A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights.
ben_obiwan_kenobi He betrayed and murdered your father.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
luke_skywalker The Force?
ben_obiwan_kenobi The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
ben_obiwan_kenobi It's an energy field created by all living things.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Now let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend, and where you come from.
luke_skywalker I saw part of a message he was I seem to have found it.
leia General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.
leia Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.
leia I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person.
leia But my ship has fallen under attack, and I am afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.
leia I have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.
leia My father will know how to retrieve it.
leia You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
leia This is our most desperate hour.
leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
leia You're my only hope.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
luke_skywalker Alderaan?
c3po I'm not going to Alderaan.
luke_skywalker I've got to get home.
luke_skywalker It's late.
luke_skywalker I'm in for it as it is.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I need your help, Luke.
luke_skywalker She needs your help.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
luke_skywalker I can't get involved.
luke_skywalker I've got work to do.
luke_skywalker It's not that I like the Empire.
luke_skywalker I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now.
luke_skywalker It's all such a long way from here.
ben_obiwan_kenobi That's your uncle talking.
luke_skywalker How am I ever gonna explain this?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Learn about the Force, Luke.
luke_skywalker Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
luke_skywalker You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You must do what you feel is right, of course.
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable.
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 They're more dangerous than you realize.
general_motti Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station.
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 The rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate- The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
grand_moff_tarkin I have just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
grand_moff_tarkin The last remnants of the old Republic have been swept away.
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 That's impossible.
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
grand_moff_tarkin The regional governors now have direct control over their territories.
grand_moff_tarkin Fear will keep the local systems in line- fear of this battle station.
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 And what of the rebellion?
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 If the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
darth_vader The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
general_motti Any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.
general_motti This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
general_motti I suggest we use it.
darth_vader Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
darth_vader The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
general_motti Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
general_motti Your sad devotion to that ancient religion hasn't helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels' hidden fortre- I find your lack of faith disturbing.
grand_moff_tarkin Enough of this.
grand_moff_tarkin Vader, release him.
darth_vader As you wish.
grand_moff_tarkin This bickering is pointless.
grand_moff_tarkin Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.
grand_moff_tarkin We will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke.
luke_skywalker It looks like the Sandpeople did this, all right.
luke_skywalker Look.
luke_skywalker There's gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.
luke_skywalker It's just, I've never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
ben_obiwan_kenobi They didn't, but we are meant to think they did.
ben_obiwan_kenobi These tracks are side-by-side.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers.
luke_skywalker These are the same Jawas that sold us R2 and 3PO.
ben_obiwan_kenobi And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
luke_skywalker But why would imperial troops want to slaughterJawas?
luke_skywalker If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to, and that would lead them back home!
ben_obiwan_kenobi Wait, Luke!
ben_obiwan_kenobi It's too dangerous!
luke_skywalker Uncle Owen!
luke_skywalker Aunt Beru!
luke_skywalker Uncle Owen!
darth_vader And now, Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base.
ben_obiwan_kenobi There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.
luke_skywalker I want to come with you to Alderaan.
luke_skywalker There's nothing for me here now.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Mos Eisley spaceport.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
ben_obiwan_kenobi We must be cautious.
clone_trooper How long have you had these droids?
luke_skywalker Three or four seasons.
ben_obiwan_kenobi They're up for sale if you want them.
clone_trooper Let me see your identification.
clone_trooper You don't need to see his identification.
clone_trooper We don't need to see his identification.
ben_obiwan_kenobi These aren't the droids you're looking for.
ben_obiwan_kenobi These aren't the droids we're looking for.
ben_obiwan_kenobi He can go about his business.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You can go about your business.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Move along.
luke_skywalker I can't abide those Jawas.
c3po Disgusting creatures!
luke_skywalker Go on, go on.
luke_skywalker I can't understand how we got by those troops.
red_three_ I thought we were dead.
ben_obiwan_kenobi The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.
luke_skywalker Do you really think we're gonna find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Most of the best freighter pilots are to be found here, only watch your step.
ben_obiwan_kenobi This place can be a little rough.
luke_skywalker I'm ready for anything.
luke_skywalker Come along, R2.
luke_skywalker Hey!
bartender#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We don't serve their kind here.
luke_skywalker What?
bartender#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Your droids, they'll have to wait outside.
bartender#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We don't want them here.
luke_skywalker Why don't you wait out by the speeder?
bartender#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We don't want any trouble.
c3po I heartily agree with you, sir.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 He doesn't like you.
luke_skywalker I'm sorry.
c3po I don't like you, either.
luke_skywalker You just watch yourself.
c3po We're wanted men.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
luke_skywalker I'll be careful.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 You'll be dead!
ben_obiwan_kenobi This little one's not worth the effort.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Come, let me get you something.
clone_trooper I'm all right.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I don't like the look of this.
han_solo Han Solo.
han_solo I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.
han_solo Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.
han_solo Fast ship?
han_solo You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Should I have?
han_solo It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs.
han_solo I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.
han_solo She's fast enough for you, old man.
c3po What's the cargo?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Only passengers myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
han_solo What is it, some kind of local trouble?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Let's just say we'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements.
han_solo Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?
han_solo And it's gonna cost you something extra.
luke_skywalker We could almost buy our own ship for that!
han_solo But who's gonna fly it, kid, you?
luke_skywalker You bet I could.
luke_skywalker I'm not such a bad pilot myself.
han_solo Seventeen, huh?
han_solo You guys got yourselves a ship.
han_solo We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Ninety-four.
han_solo Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
clone_trooper All right.
clone_trooper We'll check it out.
han_solo Those guys must really be desperate.
han_solo This could really save my neck.
han_solo Get back to the ship, get it ready.
bartender#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 You'll have to sell your speeder.
luke_skywalker That's O.K.
luke_skywalker I'm never coming back to this planet again.
greedo Going somewhere, Solo?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Yes, Greedo.
han_solo As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.
han_solo Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
luke_skywalker It's too late.
greedo You should have paid him when you had the chance.
greedo Jabba's put a price on your head so large every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.
greedo I'm lucky I found you first.
han_solo Yeah, but this time I've got the money.
greedo If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I don't have it with me.
greedo Tell Jabba- Jabba's through with you.
greedo He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.
han_solo Even I get boarded sometimes.
han_solo Do you think I had a choice?
greedo You can tell that to Jabba.
greedo He may only take your ship.
han_solo Over my dead body.
luke_skywalker That's the idea.
greedo I've been looking forward to this for a long time.
han_solo I'll bet you have.
han_solo Sorry about the mess.
darth_vader Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.
darth_vader It'll be some time before we can extract any information from her.
imperial_officer The final checkout is completed.
imperial_officer All systems are operational.
imperial_officer What course shall we set?
grand_moff_tarkin Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
luke_skywalker What do you mean?
grand_moff_tarkin I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station.
clone_trooper With pleasure.
c3po Lock the door, R2.
clone_trooper Check this side of the street.
gold_two The door's locked.
clone_trooper Move on to the next.
c3po I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.
c3po I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.
c3po You watch your language.
clone_trooper All right.
darth_vader Give it to me.
uncle_owen I'll take it.
luke_skywalker Look at this.
luke_skywalker Ever since the XP-38 came out, they just aren't in demand.
ben_obiwan_kenobi It'll be enough.
jabba_the_hutt Come out of there, Solo!
han_solo I've been waitin' for you.
darth_vader Have you now.
jabba_the_hutt Han, my boy, you disappoint me.
han_solo Look, Jabba, next time you want to talk to me, come see me yourself.
han_solo Don't send one of these twerps.
jabba_the_hutt Han, I can't make exceptions.
greedo What if everyone who smuggled for me dropped their cargo at the first sign of an imperial starship?
jabba_the_hutt It's not good business.
han_solo Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.
han_solo You think I had a choice?
han_solo I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
han_solo I just need a little more time.
c3po Don't push it.
luke_skywalker Okay, 15%.
jabba_the_hutt But if you fail me again I'll put a price on your head so big you won't be able to go near a civilized system.
luke_skywalker Come on!
ben_obiwan_kenobi If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.
luke_skywalker What a piece of junk!
clone_trooper She'll make.5 past light speed.
han_solo She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
han_solo I've made a lot of special modifications myself.
han_solo But we're a little rushed, so if you'll just get on board, we'll get outta here.
luke_skywalker Hello, sir.
clone_trooper Which way?
man's_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 All right, men, load your weapons.
clone_trooper Stop that ship!
luke_skywalker Blast them!
han_solo Chewie, get us out of here!
c3po Oh, my.
c3po I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
han_solo Looks like an imperial cruiser.
han_solo Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.
han_solo Try and hold 'em off.
han_solo Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
han_solo Stay sharp.
luke_skywalker There's two more comin' in.
luke_skywalker They're gonna try and cut us off.
luke_skywalker Why don't you outrun 'em?
luke_skywalker I thought you said this thing was fast!
han_solo Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home.
han_solo We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.
han_solo Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
han_solo We'll lose 'em.
han_solo Here's where the fun begins.
ben_obiwan_kenobi How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
han_solo It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer.
luke_skywalker Are you kidding?
luke_skywalker At the rate they're gaining?
han_solo Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dustin' crops, boy!
han_solo Without precise calculations, we'd fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova, and that would end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
c3po What's that flashing?
han_solo We're losing a deflector shield.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.
general_motti We've entered the Alderaan system.
leia I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.
leia I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
grand_moff_tarkin Charming to the last.
grand_moff_tarkin You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life.
leia I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
grand_moff_tarkin Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.
grand_moff_tarkin No star system will dare oppose the emperor now.
leia The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
grand_moff_tarkin Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.
grand_moff_tarkin In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that will be destroyed first.
grand_moff_tarkin Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet ofAlderaan.
leia No!
leia Alderaan is peaceful.
leia We have no weapons.
grand_moff_tarkin You can't possibly You would prefer another target?
grand_moff_tarkin A military target?
grand_moff_tarkin Then name the system.
grand_moff_tarkin Where is the rebel base?
leia Dantooine.
leia They're on Dantooine.
grand_moff_tarkin There.
grand_moff_tarkin Continue with the operation.
grand_moff_tarkin You may fire when ready.
luke_skywalker What?
grand_moff_tarkin You're far too trusting.
grand_moff_tarkin Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration, but don't worry.
grand_moff_tarkin We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.
leia No!
darth_vader Commence primary ignition.
clone_trooper Are you all right?
c3po What's wrong?
ben_obiwan_kenobi I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I fear something terrible has happened.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You'd better get on with your exercises.
han_solo Well, you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs.
luke_skywalker I told you I'd outrun them.
han_solo Don't everybody thank me at once.
han_solo Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about 0200 hours.
c3po Now be careful, R2.
c3po He made a fair move.
c3po Screaming about it can't help you.
han_solo Let him have it.
han_solo It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
c3po But, sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
han_solo That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose.
han_solo Wookiees are known to do that.
c3po Grrr I see your point, sir.
c3po I suggest a new strategy, R2.
c3po Let the Wookiee win.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
luke_skywalker You mean it controls your actions?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
han_solo Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
luke_skywalker You don't believe in the Force, do you?
han_solo Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.
han_solo I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
han_solo There's no mystical energy field controls my destiny.
han_solo It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I suggest you try it again, Luke.
ben_obiwan_kenobi This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
luke_skywalker With the blast shield down, I can't even see.
luke_skywalker How am I supposed to fight?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Your eyes can deceive you.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Don't trust them.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Stretch out with your feelings.
han_solo You see?
ben_obiwan_kenobi You can do it.
han_solo Han: I call it luck.
ben_obiwan_kenobi In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
han_solo Look, good against remotes is one thing.
han_solo Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
luke_skywalker You know, I did feel something.
luke_skywalker I could almost see the remote.
luke_skywalker That's good.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You've taken your first step into a larger world.
grand_moff_tarkin Yes?
officer_cass#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.
officer_cass#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 They found the remains of a rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.
officer_cass#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
grand_moff_tarkin She lied.
grand_moff_tarkin She lied to us!
darth_vader I told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion.
grand_moff_tarkin Terminate her immediately.
luke_skywalker Stand by, Chewie.
c3po Here we go.
han_solo Cut in the sublight engines.
han_solo We've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
han_solo Some kind of asteroid collision.
han_solo It's not on any of the charts.
c3po What's going on?
han_solo Our position's correct, except no Alderaan.
luke_skywalker What do you mean?
c3po Where is it?
uncle_owen That's what I'm trying to tell you, kid.
han_solo It ain't there.
han_solo It's been totally blown away.
luke_skywalker What?
luke_skywalker How?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Destroyed by the Empire.
han_solo The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.
luke_skywalker Maybe they know what happened.
ben_obiwan_kenobi It's an imperial fighter.
luke_skywalker It followed us!
leia No.
ben_obiwan_kenobi It's a short-range fighter.
luke_skywalker There aren't any bases around here.
han_solo Where did it come from?
luke_skywalker It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
luke_skywalker If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
han_solo Not if I can help it.
han_solo Chewie, jam its transmissions.
ben_obiwan_kenobi It would be as well to let it go.
ben_obiwan_kenobi It's too far out of range.
han_solo Not for long.
ben_obiwan_kenobi A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
luke_skywalker He must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.
han_solo Well, he ain't gonna be around long enough to tell anybody about us.
luke_skywalker Look at him.
luke_skywalker He's heading for that small moon.
han_solo I think I can get him before he gets there.
han_solo He's almost in range.
luke_skywalker That's no moon.
ben_obiwan_kenobi It's a space station.
ben_obiwan_kenobi It's too big to be a space station.
luke_skywalker I have a very bad feeling about this.
uncle_owen Yeah.
han_solo I think you're right.
han_solo Full reverse!
han_solo Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
han_solo Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power!
c3po Why are we still moving towards it?
c3po 
c3po !
han_solo We're caught in a tractor beam.
han_solo It's pulling us in!
luke_skywalker There's got to be something you can do!
luke_skywalker There's nothing I can do about it, kid.
han_solo I'm at full power.
han_solo I'm gonna have to shut down.
han_solo They're not gonna get me without a fight.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You can't win, but there are alternatives to fighting.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We are opening the magnetic field.
clone_trooper To your stations!
luke_skywalker Come with me.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Close all outboard shields.
grand_moff_tarkin Yes?
voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.
voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Its markings match those ofa ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
darth_vader They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.
darth_vader She may yet be of some use to us.
voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Release charge.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 There's no one on board, sir.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 It must be a decoy, sir.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
darth_vader Did you find any droids?
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 No, sir.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
darth_vader Send a scanning crew aboard.
darth_vader I want every part of this ship checked.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Yes, sir.
darth_vader I want every part of this ship checked.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 There's no one here.
luke_skywalker Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
han_solo I use them for smuggling.
han_solo I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.
han_solo This is ridiculous.
han_solo Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
darth_vader Leave that to me.
han_solo Damn fool, I knew that you were gonna say that.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?
clone_trooper The ship's all yours.
clone_trooper If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.
uncle_owen All right, let's go.
han_solo Could you give us a hand with this?
GANTRY_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 TK-421, why aren't you at your post?
GANTRY_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Take over.
GANTRY_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We've got a bad transmitter.
luke_skywalker I'll see what I can do.
luke_skywalker Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
han_solo Bring them on!
han_solo I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneakin' around.
c3po We've found the computer outlet, sir.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Plug in.
ben_obiwan_kenobi He should be able to interpret the entire imperial network.
c3po He says he's found the main controls to the power beam that's holding the ship here.
c3po He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
c3po The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.
c3po A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
c3po I don't think you boys can help.
luke_skywalker I must go alone.
han_solo Whatever you say.
han_solo I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
luke_skywalker I want to go with you.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Be patient, Luke.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Stay and watch over the droids.
ben_obiwan_kenobi They must be delivered safely, or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.
ben_obiwan_kenobi The Force will be with you always.
luke_skywalker You said it, Chewie.
han_solo Where did you dig up that old fossil?
luke_skywalker Ben is a great man.
c3po Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
luke_skywalker I didn't hear you give any ideas.
han_solo Well, anything's better than just hangin' around waiting for 'em to pick us up.
uncle_owen Who do you think What is it?
c3po I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
c3po He says "I've found her" and keeps repeating "She's here." Well, who who has he found?
c3po Princess Leia.
luke_skywalker The princess?
luke_skywalker She's here?
c3po 
c3po !
c3po Princess?
grand_moff_tarkin Where?
luke_skywalker Where is she?
c3po Princess?
c3po What's going on?
c3po I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
luke_skywalker Oh, no!
luke_skywalker We've got to do something!
luke_skywalker What are you talking about?
luke_skywalker The droids belong to her.
luke_skywalker She's the one in the message.
luke_skywalker We got to help her.
han_solo Now look, don't get any funny ideas.
han_solo The old man wants us to wait right here.
luke_skywalker But he didn't know she was here.
luke_skywalker Just find a way back into that detention block.
c3po I'm not going anywhere.
luke_skywalker They're going to execute her.
luke_skywalker Look, a few minutes ago, you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.
luke_skywalker Now all you want to do is stay?
han_solo Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
luke_skywalker But they're gonna kill her!
han_solo Better her than me.
luke_skywalker She's rich.
han_solo Rich?
luke_skywalker Rich, powerful.
luke_skywalker Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be What?
luke_skywalker Well, more well than you can imagine.
luke_skywalker I don't know.
han_solo I can imagine quite a bit.
luke_skywalker You'll get it.
han_solo I better.
luke_skywalker You will.
luke_skywalker All right, kid.
han_solo You better be right about this.
clone_trooper All right.
ben_obiwan_kenobi What's your plan?
luke_skywalker Um 3 PO, hand me those binders there, will you?
luke_skywalker Now I'm gonna put these on you.
luke_skywalker Han, you you put those on.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Don't worry, Chewie.
han_solo I think I know what he has in mind.
c3po Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking, but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?
c3po Lock the door.
han_solo And hope they don't have blasters.
c3po That isn't very reassuring.
luke_skywalker Luke: I can't see a thing in this helmet.
han_solo Han: This is not gonna work.
luke_skywalker Luke: Why didn't you say so before?
luke_skywalker I did say so before.
c3po Where are you taking this thing?
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I wasn't notified.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I'll have to clear it.
han_solo Han: Look out!
han_solo He's loose!
luke_skywalker I'll get him!
luke_skywalker Look out!
han_solo Han: We gotta find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
han_solo You go and get her.
han_solo I'll hold them here.
han_solo Uh Uh, everything's under control.
han_solo Situation normal.
c3po What happened?
han_solo Had a slight weapons malfunction, but, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.
luke_skywalker Thank you.
han_solo How are you?
INTERCOM_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We're sending a squad up.
han_solo Uh, negative, negative!
han_solo We have aa reactor leak here, uh, now.
han_solo Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
han_solo Uh, large leak, very dangerous.
luke_skywalker Who is this?
han_solo What's your operating number?
han_solo Uh Boring conversation anyway.
aunt_beru Luke!
han_solo We're gonna have company!
leia Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
luke_skywalker Oh, the uniform.
luke_skywalker I'm Luke Skywalker.
luke_skywalker I'm here to rescue you.
leia You're who?
luke_skywalker I'm here to rescue you.
luke_skywalker I've got your R2 unit.
luke_skywalker I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
luke_skywalker Ben Kenobi?
c3po 
c3po !
luke_skywalker Where is he?
luke_skywalker Come on!
ben_obiwan_kenobi He is here.
leia Obi-Wan Kenobi?
luke_skywalker What makes you think so?
darth_vader A tremor in the Force.
darth_vader The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
grand_moff_tarkin Surely he must be dead by now.
darth_vader Don't underestimate the Force.
ben_obiwan_kenobi The Jedi are extinct.
grand_moff_tarkin Their fire has gone out of the universe.
grand_moff_tarkin You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
grand_moff_tarkin Yes.
INTERCOM_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We have an emergency alert in Detention Block AA-23.
luke_skywalker The princess?
grand_moff_tarkin Put all sections on alert.
darth_vader Obi-Wan is here.
darth_vader The Force is with him.
grand_moff_tarkin If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
darth_vader Escape is not his plan.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I must face him alone.
han_solo Get behind me!
han_solo Get behind me!
red_leader Watch your left.
han_solo Can't get out that way.
leia Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
han_solo Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Yes, sir?
luke_skywalker Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?
luke_skywalker We've been cut off!
c3po What was that?
luke_skywalker I didn't copy.
c3po I said all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.
clone_trooper Stormtrooper: Open up in there!
clone_trooper Open up in there!
luke_skywalker Oh, no!
chief_pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 There isn't any other way out!
han_solo I can't hold them off forever!
han_solo Now what?
c3po 
c3po !
c3po This is some rescue!
leia You came in here, and you didn't have a plan for getting out?
han_solo He's the brains, sweetheart!
c3po Well, I didn't- What the hell are you doing?
leia Somebody has to save our skins.
leia Into the garbage chute, flyboy.
luke_skywalker Get in there!
han_solo Get in there, you big furry oaf!
han_solo I don't care what you smell.
han_solo Get in there, and don't worry about it.
han_solo Wonderful girl!
luke_skywalker Get in there!
han_solo The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.
han_solo What an incredible smell you've discovered!
luke_skywalker Let's get out of here.
han_solo Get away from there.
luke_skywalker No, wait!
uncle_owen Will you forget it?
c3po 
c3po !
luke_skywalker I already tried it!
luke_skywalker It's magnetically sealed.
leia Put that thing away!
c3po You're gonna get us all killed!
han_solo Absolutely, Your Worship.
han_solo Look, I had everything under control till you led us down here!
han_solo Ya know, it's not gonna take 'em long to figure out what happened to us!
leia It could be worse.
han_solo It's worse.
han_solo There's something alive in here.
ben_obiwan_kenobi That's your imagination.
luke_skywalker Something just moved past my leg.
luke_skywalker Look!
c3po Did you see that?
luke_skywalker What?
han_solo Kid!
aunt_beru Luke!
aunt_beru Luke!
leia Luke, grab hold of this!
luke_skywalker Blast it!
luke_skywalker My gun's jammed.
grand_moff_tarkin Where?
luke_skywalker Anywhere!
ben_obiwan_kenobi Luke, Luke!
c3po Help him!
c3po What happened?
luke_skywalker I don't know.
luke_skywalker Itjust let go of me and disappeared.
luke_skywalker I got a bad feeling about this.
luke_skywalker The walls are moving!
red_three_ Don't just stand there!
leia Try and brace it with something.
c3po Help me!
luke_skywalker Wait a minute!
luke_skywalker Come in, 3PO!
uncle_owen Where could he be?
GANTRY_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Take over.
See#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Look, there.
c3po They're madmen.
c3po They're heading for the prison level.
c3po If you hurry, you might catch them.
FIRST_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Follow me.
FIRST_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 You stand guard.
luke_skywalker Come on.
han_solo Oh!
c3po All this excitement has overrun the circuits in my counterpart here.
c3po If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
clone_trooper All right.
luke_skywalker Come in, 3PO!
han_solo Get on top!
leia I can't.
uncle_owen Where could he be?
c3po 
c3po !

han_solo Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight.
han_solo I take orders from just one personme.
leia It's a wonder you're still alive.
leia Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
han_solo No reward is worth this.
clone_trooper Give me regular reports, please.
luke_skywalker Do you know what's going on?
SECOND_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Maybe it's another drill.
uncle_owen Yeah.
clone_trooper Ah, it's nothing.
camie#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Don't worry about it.
clone_trooper There she is.
luke_skywalker Do you copy?

luke_skywalker I think we took a wrong turn.
luke_skywalker There's no lock.
luke_skywalker That oughta hold them for a while.
luke_skywalker We've got to get across.
leia Find the controls that extend the bridge.
luke_skywalker I think I just blasted it.

luke_skywalker Here, hold this.
luke_skywalker Here they come.
leia For luck.
leia Where could they be?
clone_trooper Close the blast doors!
clone_trooper Open the blast doors!
clone_trooper Open the blast doors!
han_solo I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
darth_vader We meet again at last.
darth_vader The circle is now complete.
darth_vader When I left you, I was but the learner.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Only a master of evil, Darth.
darth_vader Your powers are weak, old man.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You can't win, Darth.
ben_obiwan_kenobi If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
han_solo Didn't we just leave this party?
han_solo What kept you?
leia We, uh, ran into some old friends.
clone_trooper The ship all right?
han_solo It seems O.K., if we can get to it.
han_solo I just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
luke_skywalker Look!
c3po Come on, R2, we're going.
han_solo Now's our chance!
han_solo Go!
luke_skywalker Ben?
leia No!
luke_skywalker Come on!
greedo Luke, it's too late!
luke_skywalker Blast the door, kid!
han_solo I hope that old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip.
han_solo We're coming up on their sentry ships.
han_solo Hold them off.
han_solo Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns.
luke_skywalker I can't believe he's gone.
leia There wasn't anything you could have done.
luke_skywalker Come on, buddy.
han_solo We're not out of this yet.
han_solo You in, kid?
han_solo O.K., stay sharp.
luke_skywalker Here they come.
c3po They're coming in too fast!
leia We've lost the lateral controls!
grand_moff_tarkin Don't worry.
han_solo She'll hold together.
han_solo Hear me, baby?
han_solo Hold together.
han_solo Got him!
han_solo I got him!
han_solo Great, kid!
han_solo Don't get cocky.

c3po That's it!
luke_skywalker We did it!
luke_skywalker We did it!
c3po Help!
c3po I think I'm melting!
c3po This is all your fault!
darth_vader Are they away?
darth_vader They've just made the jump into hyperspace.
grand_moff_tarkin You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?
grand_moff_tarkin I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.
grand_moff_tarkin This had better work.
han_solo Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
han_solo You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.
leia That doesn't sound too hard.
leia It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
greedo You call that easy?
c3po They're tracking us.
jabba_the_hutt Not this ship, sister.
leia At least the information in R2 is still intact.
luke_skywalker What's so important?
han_solo What's he carrying?
grand_moff_tarkin The technical readouts of that battle station.
leia I only hope that when the data's analyzed, a weakness can be found.
leia It's not over yet.
han_solo It is for me, sister.
han_solo Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.
han_solo I expect to be well paid.
han_solo I'm in it for the money.
clone_trooper You needn't worry about your reward.
leia If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive.
leia Your friend is quite a mercenary.
leia I wonder if he really cares about anything or anybody.
luke_skywalker I care.
luke_skywalker So what do you think of her, Han?
han_solo I'm trying not to, kid.
luke_skywalker Good.
han_solo Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
luke_skywalker I don't know.
luke_skywalker What do you think?
han_solo You think a princess and a guy like me- No!
luke_skywalker You're safe.
leia We have no time for sorrows, Commander.
c3po It's our only hope.
grand_moff_tarkin Yes.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We're approaching the planet Yavin.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 The rebel base is on a moon on the far side.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We are preparing to orbit the planet.
general_dodonna The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the starfleet.
general_dodonna Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.
general_dodonna A small, one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
gold_leader Pilot: Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
general_dodonna The Empire doesn't consider a small, one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.
general_dodonna An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
general_dodonna The approach will not be easy.
general_dodonna You're required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.
general_dodonna The target area is only 2 meters wide.
general_dodonna It's a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port.
general_dodonna The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.
general_dodonna A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.
general_dodonna Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.
general_dodonna The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
red_two_ That's impossible, even for a computer.
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 It's not impossible.
luke_skywalker I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-16 back home.
luke_skywalker They're not much bigger than 2 meters.
general_dodonna Then man your ships, and may the Force be with you.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 The moon with the rebel base will be in range in 30 minutes.
darth_vader This will be a day long remembered.
darth_vader It has seen the end of Kenobi and will soon see the end of the rebellion.
man's_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 All flight crews, man your stations.
luke_skywalker So you got your reward and you're just leaving, then?
luke_skywalker That's right.
uncle_owen Yeah.
han_solo I got some old debts I got to pay off with this stuff.
han_solo And even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do ya?
luke_skywalker Why don't you come with us?
han_solo You're pretty good in a fight.
luke_skywalker We could use ya.
luke_skywalker Come on.
han_solo Why don't you take a look around?
luke_skywalker You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.
luke_skywalker They could use a good pilot like you.
luke_skywalker You're turning your back on them.
han_solo What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
han_solo Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.
han_solo It's more like suicide.
clone_trooper All right.
luke_skywalker Take care of yourself, Han.
luke_skywalker I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
darth_vader May the Force be with you.
luke_skywalker What are you looking at?
han_solo I know what I'm doing.
man's_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 All pilots to your stations.
c3po What's wrong?
clone_trooper Oh, it's Han.
luke_skywalker I don't know.
luke_skywalker I really thought he'd change his mind.
luke_skywalker He's got to follow his own path.
leia No one can choose it for him.
luke_skywalker I only wish Ben were here.
luke_skywalker Biggs!
luke_skywalker I don't believe it.
han_solo How are you?
gold_leader Hey, coming up?
red_three_ Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot in the outer-rim territories.
clone_trooper You'll do all right.
luke_skywalker Thank you, sir.
luke_skywalker I'll try.
red_three_ I gotta get aboard.
clone_trooper All right.
han_solo I told you I'd make it someday.
red_three_ It'll be like old times, Luke.
chief#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Hey, this R2 unit of yours seems a bit beat up.
chief#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 You want a new one?
luke_skywalker Not on your life.
luke_skywalker That little droid and I have been through a lot together.
luke_skywalker Good.
luke_skywalker You've got to come back.
c3po You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
general_dodonna Obi-Wan: Luke, the Force will be with you.
luke_skywalker Standby alert.

red_two_ This is Red Five.
luke_skywalker I'm going in.

clone_trooper Are you all right?
luke_skywalker I got a little cooked, but I'm O.K.
ASTRO-officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader, but they're so small, they're evading our turbolasers.
darth_vader We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.
darth_vader Get the crews to their fighters.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Watch yourself.
red_leader There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.
luke_skywalker I'm on it.
luke_skywalker I'm going in.

luke_skywalker I've got a problem here.

luke_skywalker Here they come.
luke_skywalker I'm hit!
luke_skywalker I can't see it!
luke_skywalker He's on me tight.
luke_skywalker I can't shake him!
luke_skywalker I'll be right there.

red_three_ Fall in!
red_two_ Watch your back, Luke.
red_leader Watch your back.

gold_five They came from behind.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Should I have your ship standing by?
grand_moff_tarkin Evacuate in our moment of triumph?

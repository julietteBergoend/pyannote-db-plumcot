c3po Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!
c3po We're doomed!
c3po There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
c3po What's that?
c3po I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
luke_skywalker Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!
c3po Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?
c3po At last! Where have you been?
c3po They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
c3po Wait a minute, where are you going?
imperial_officer The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
darth_vader Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
darth_vader What have you done with those plans?
rebel#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 officer We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah... This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
darth_vader If this is a consular ship... were is the Ambassador?
darth_vader Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!
clone_trooper There she is! Set for stun!
clone_trooper She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
c3po Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..
r2d2 beeps
c3po Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.
c3po Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there!
c3po I'm going to regret this.
chief_pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 There goes another one.
captain_raymus_antilles Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited.
c3po That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
c3po Are you sure this things safe?
woman#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I've told you kids to slow down!
fixer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
camie#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 It was just wormie on another rampage.
luke_skywalker Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?
luke_skywalker I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?
red_three_ Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working.
luke_skywalker The Academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?
red_three_ Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service... I just came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
luke_skywalker I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look!
deak#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Not again! Forget it.
luke_skywalker There they are!
red_three_ That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there! Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.
luke_skywalker But there was a lot of firing earlier...
luke_skywalker Hey, easy with those...
camie#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Don't worry about it, Wormie.
fixer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system. Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...
luke_skywalker agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about Luke's ineptitude.
leia Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...
darth_vader Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
leia I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
darth_vader You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor. Take her away!
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.
darth_vader I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 She'll die before she tells you anything.
darth_vader Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
senator Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
darth_vader She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Yes, sir.
c3po How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.
c3po I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen.
c3po What a desolate place this is.
c3po Where are you going?
c3po Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier.
c3po What makes you think there are settlements over there?
c3po Don't get technical with me.
c3po What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!
c3po And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.
c3po No more adventures. I'm not going that way.
r2d2 beeps
c3po That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.
c3po Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved!
c3po Over here! Help! Please, help!
luke_skywalker and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer and the others can be heard working inside.
luke_skywalker ...so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail. I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He grounded me for the rest of the season. You should have been there... it was fantastic.
red_three_ You ought to take it easy Luke. You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.
luke_skywalker Look who's talking. Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...
red_three_ I've missed you kid.
luke_skywalker Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs. It's been so... quiet.
red_three_ Luke, I didn't come back just to say good-bye... I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.
luke_skywalker What are you talking about?
red_three_ I made some friends at the Academy. ...when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance...
luke_skywalker Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How?
red_three_ Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!
luke_skywalker I'm sorry. I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am. You can barely hear me...
red_three_ My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
luke_skywalker You're crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them.
red_three_ I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own... It's what we always talked about. Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side -- the side I believe in.
luke_skywalker And I'm stuck here...
red_three_ I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
luke_skywalker Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
red_three_ Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.
luke_skywalker I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now.
red_three_ I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?... You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
luke_skywalker It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't bother with this rock.
red_three_ Things always change.
luke_skywalker I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long?
red_three_ No, I'm leaving in the morning...
luke_skywalker Then I guess I won't see you.
red_three_ Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.
luke_skywalker Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure... Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.
red_three_ So long, Luke.
c3po Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!
clone_trooper Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.
SECOND_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Look, sir -- droids.
c3po Wake up! Wake up!
c3po We're doomed.
c3po Do you think they'll melt us down?
r2d2 beep
c3po Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end?
aunt_beru Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
luke_skywalker It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
uncle_owen I have no need for a protocol droid.
c3po Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
uncle_owen What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
c3po Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter... very similar to your vaporators. You could say...
uncle_owen Do you speak Bocce?
c3po Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me... I'm as fluent in Bocce...
uncle_owen All right shut up! I'll take this one.
c3po Shutting up, sir.
uncle_owen Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
luke_skywalker But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
uncle_owen You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it!
luke_skywalker All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go.
luke_skywalker Uncle Owen...
uncle_owen Yeah?
luke_skywalker This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
uncle_owen Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
c3po Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.
luke_skywalker Uncle Owen...
uncle_owen Yeah?
luke_skywalker What about that one?
uncle_owen What about that blue one? We'll take that one.
luke_skywalker Yeah, take it away.
c3po Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes.
luke_skywalker Okay, let's go.
c3po Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
c3po Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
luke_skywalker It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!
c3po Is there anything I might do to help?
luke_skywalker Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
c3po I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
luke_skywalker Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
c3po I see, sir.
luke_skywalker Uh, you can call me Luke.
c3po I see, sir Luke.
luke_skywalker Just Luke.
c3po And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
luke_skywalker Hello.
r2d2 beeps
luke_skywalker You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
c3po With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
luke_skywalker You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
c3po That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
luke_skywalker Have you been in many battles?
c3po Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
luke_skywalker Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or...
leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
luke_skywalker What's this?
c3po What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that?
leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
c3po Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.
luke_skywalker Who is she? She's beautiful.
c3po I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
c3po I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to...
luke_skywalker Is there more to this recording?
c3po Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.
c3po He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
luke_skywalker Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
c3po I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
luke_skywalker Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.
luke_skywalker I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.
c3po He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
luke_skywalker H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.
luke_skywalker There you go.
luke_skywalker Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.
c3po What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
aunt_beru Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
luke_skywalker All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
c3po I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
luke_skywalker Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back.
c3po Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
c3po No, I don't think he likes you at all.
r2d2 beeps.
c3po No, I don't like you either.
luke_skywalker You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
uncle_owen What makes you think that?
luke_skywalker Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
luke_skywalker I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.
uncle_owen That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.
luke_skywalker But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
uncle_owen He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.
luke_skywalker He knew my father?
uncle_owen I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
luke_skywalker Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.
uncle_owen You mean the next semester before harvest?
luke_skywalker Sure, there're more than enough droids.
uncle_owen Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year.
uncle_owen You must understand I need you here, Luke.
luke_skywalker But it's a whole 'nother year.
uncle_owen Look, it's only one more season.
luke_skywalker Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.
aunt_beru Where are you going?
luke_skywalker It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.
aunt_beru Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.
uncle_owen I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.
aunt_beru Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.
uncle_owen That's what I'm afraid of.
luke_skywalker What are you doing hiding there?
c3po It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.
luke_skywalker Oh, no!
c3po That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times.
luke_skywalker How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!
c3po Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
luke_skywalker It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning.
uncle_owen Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.
luke_skywalker All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.
luke_skywalker You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
c3po Oh, he excels at that, sir.
uncle_owen Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now!
uncle_owen Have you seen Luke this morning?
aunt_beru He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.
uncle_owen Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?
aunt_beru I think so.
uncle_owen Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay!
luke_skywalker How's that.
luke_skywalker Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must have missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.
c3po Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.
luke_skywalker Sure. He needs you. He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
c3po Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...
luke_skywalker Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.
luke_skywalker Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?
c3po Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
luke_skywalker Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.
c3po If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.
luke_skywalker No, he's not going to try anything.
luke_skywalker What's wrong with him now?
c3po Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
luke_skywalker Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on.
luke_skywalker There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Don't worry, he'll be all right.
luke_skywalker What happened?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece.
luke_skywalker Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!
ben_obiwan_kenobi The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?
luke_skywalker Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.
luke_skywalker I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.
luke_skywalker You know him!
ben_obiwan_kenobi Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.
luke_skywalker Then the droid does belong to you.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting...
ben_obiwan_kenobi I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
luke_skywalker Threepio!
c3po Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...
luke_skywalker Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.
c3po I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for.
luke_skywalker No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?
luke_skywalker and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Quickly, son... they're on the move.
luke_skywalker No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
ben_obiwan_kenobi That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
luke_skywalker You fought in the Clone Wars?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.
luke_skywalker I wish I'd known him.
ben_obiwan_kenobi He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me...
ben_obiwan_kenobi I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
c3po Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.
luke_skywalker Sure, go ahead.
luke_skywalker What is it?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
ben_obiwan_kenobi An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.
luke_skywalker hasn't really been listening.
luke_skywalker How did my father die?
ben_obiwan_kenobi A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
luke_skywalker The Force?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from.
luke_skywalker I saw part of the message he was...
ben_obiwan_kenobi I seem to have found it.
leia General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
luke_skywalker Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
luke_skywalker I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.
ben_obiwan_kenobi That's your uncle talking.
luke_skywalker Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Learn about the Force, Luke.
luke_skywalker Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You must do what you feel is right, of course.
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize.
general_motti Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as....
grand_moff_tarkin The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
grand_moff_tarkin The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.
tagge#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
darth_vader The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
general_motti Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!
darth_vader Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
general_motti Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...
darth_vader I find your lack of faith disturbing.
grand_moff_tarkin Enough of this! Vader, release him!
darth_vader As you wish.
grand_moff_tarkin This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.
luke_skywalker It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
ben_obiwan_kenobi They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.
luke_skywalker These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
ben_obiwan_kenobi And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
luke_skywalker Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
luke_skywalker If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home!
ben_obiwan_kenobi Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.
luke_skywalker Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!
darth_vader And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.
ben_obiwan_kenobi There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire.
luke_skywalker I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.
clone_trooper How long have you had these droids?
luke_skywalker About three or four seasons.
ben_obiwan_kenobi They're for sale if you want them.
clone_trooper Let me see your identification.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You don't need to see his identification.
clone_trooper We don't need to see his identification.
ben_obiwan_kenobi These are not the droids your looking for.
clone_trooper These are not the droids we're looking for.
ben_obiwan_kenobi He can go about his business.
clone_trooper You can go about your business.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Move along.
clone_trooper Move along. Move along.
c3po I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.
luke_skywalker Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead.
ben_obiwan_kenobi The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally.
luke_skywalker Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough.
luke_skywalker I'm ready for anything.
c3po Come along, Artoo.
bartender#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We don't serve their kind here!
luke_skywalker still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's drift.
luke_skywalker What?
bartender#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here.
luke_skywalker Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble.
c3po I heartily agree with you sir.
creature#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 He doesn't like you.
luke_skywalker I'm sorry.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I don't like you either.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Don't insult us. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems.
luke_skywalker I'll be careful than.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 You'll be dead.
ben_obiwan_kenobi This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something...
bartender#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 No blasters! No blaster!
ben_obiwan_kenobi This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
c3po I don't like the look of this.
han_solo Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.
han_solo Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Should I have?
han_solo It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
han_solo I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
han_solo What is it? Some kind of local trouble?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
han_solo Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance.
luke_skywalker Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!
han_solo But who's going to fly it, kid! You?
luke_skywalker You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen...
ben_obiwan_kenobi We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.
han_solo Seventeen, huh!
han_solo Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Ninety-four.
han_solo Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
ben_obiwan_kenobi and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some questions. The bartender points to the booth.
clone_trooper All right, we'll check it out.
han_solo Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You'll have to sell your speeder.
luke_skywalker That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again.
greedo Going somewhere, Solo?
han_solo Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
greedo It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first.
han_solo Yeah, but this time I got the money.
greedo If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
han_solo I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...
greedo Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
han_solo Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?
han_solo Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.
greedo You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.
han_solo Over my dead body.
greedo That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
han_solo Yes, I'll bet you have.
han_solo Sorry about the mess.
darth_vader Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
imperial_officer The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?
grand_moff_tarkin Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
darth_vader What do you mean?
grand_moff_tarkin I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.
clone_trooper With pleasure.
c3po Lock the door, Artoo.
clone_trooper All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door.
c3po I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.
r2d2 beeps
c3po You watch your language!
luke_skywalker He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand.
ben_obiwan_kenobi It will be enough.
ben_obiwan_kenobi If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.
jabba_the_hutt the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth.
jabba_the_hutt Come on out, Solo!
han_solo I've been waiting for you, Jabba.
jabba_the_hutt I expected you would be.
han_solo I'm not the type to run.
jabba_the_hutt Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.
han_solo You sent Greedo to blast me.
jabba_the_hutt Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business. You're too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern at your delays. He wasn't going to blast you.
han_solo I think he thought he was. Next time don't send one of those twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself.
jabba_the_hutt Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception. Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good business.
han_solo You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time.
jabba_the_hutt Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you. So, for an extra, say twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it. If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.
han_solo Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.
luke_skywalker What a piece of junk.
han_solo She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself.
han_solo We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here.
c3po Hello, sir.
clone_trooper Which way?
clone_trooper All right, men. Load your weapons!
clone_trooper Stop that ship!
han_solo Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as he ducks into the spaceship.
clone_trooper Blast 'em!
c3po Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
han_solo It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
han_solo Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
luke_skywalker Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast.
han_solo Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!
han_solo Here's where the fun begins!
ben_obiwan_kenobi How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
han_solo It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.
luke_skywalker Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...
han_solo Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
luke_skywalker What's that flashing?
han_solo We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.
general_motti We've entered the Alderaan system.
leia Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
grand_moff_tarkin Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
leia I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself!
grand_moff_tarkin Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.
leia The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
grand_moff_tarkin Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.
leia No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly...
grand_moff_tarkin You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!
grand_moff_tarkin I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?
leia Dantooine.
leia They're on Dantooine.
grand_moff_tarkin There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.
leia What?
grand_moff_tarkin You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough.
leia No!
darth_vader Commence primary ignition.
luke_skywalker Are you all right? What's wrong?
ben_obiwan_kenobi I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You'd better get on with your exercises.
han_solo Solo enters the room.
han_solo Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em.
han_solo Don't everyone thank me at once.
han_solo Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
c3po Now be careful, Artoo.
c3po He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you.
han_solo Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
c3po But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
han_solo That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.
c3po I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
luke_skywalker You mean it controls your actions?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
han_solo Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
luke_skywalker You don't believe in the Force, do you?
han_solo Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.
han_solo It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I suggest you try it again, Luke.
ben_obiwan_kenobi This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
luke_skywalker With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Stretch out with your feelings.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You see, you can do it.
han_solo I call it luck.
ben_obiwan_kenobi In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
han_solo Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else.
han_solo Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
luke_skywalker You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.
ben_obiwan_kenobi That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.
grand_moff_tarkin Yes.
officer_cass#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
grand_moff_tarkin She lied! She lied to us!
darth_vader I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
grand_moff_tarkin Terminate her... immediately!
han_solo Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines.
han_solo What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts.
luke_skywalker What's going on?
han_solo Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!
luke_skywalker What do you mean? Where is it?
han_solo Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away.
luke_skywalker What? How?
ben_obiwan_kenobi Destroyed... by the Empire!
han_solo The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
han_solo There's another ship coming in.
luke_skywalker Maybe they know what happened.
ben_obiwan_kenobi It's an Imperial fighter.
luke_skywalker It followed us!
ben_obiwan_kenobi No. It's a short range fighter.
han_solo There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from?
luke_skywalker It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
han_solo Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions.
ben_obiwan_kenobi It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.
han_solo Not for long...
ben_obiwan_kenobi A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
luke_skywalker It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.
han_solo Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.
luke_skywalker Look at him. He's headed for that small moon.
han_solo I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
ben_obiwan_kenobi That's no moon! It's a space station.
han_solo It's too big to be a space station.
luke_skywalker I have a very bad feeling about this.
han_solo Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
luke_skywalker Why are we still moving towards it?
han_solo We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!
luke_skywalker But there's gotta be something you can do!
han_solo There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight!
ben_obiwan_kenobi You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Clear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic field.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 To you stations! Come with me.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields!
grand_moff_tarkin Yes.
voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
darth_vader They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us.
darth_vader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft.
voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
darth_vader Did you find any droids?
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
darth_vader Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Yes, sir.
darth_vader I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked!
luke_skywalker Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
han_solo I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Leave that to me!
han_solo Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
ben_obiwan_kenobi Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?
clone_trooper The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go.
han_solo Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?
GANTRY_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy?
GANTRY_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do.
luke_skywalker You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
han_solo Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
c3po We found the computer outlet, sir.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
c3po He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
c3po The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
ben_obiwan_kenobi I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.
han_solo Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already.
luke_skywalker I want to go with you.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.
luke_skywalker But he can...
ben_obiwan_kenobi They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you... always!
han_solo Boy you said it, Chewie.
han_solo Where did you dig up that old fossil?
luke_skywalker Ben is a great man.
han_solo Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
luke_skywalker I didn't hear you give any ideas...
han_solo Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...
luke_skywalker Who do you think...
luke_skywalker What is it?
c3po I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says "I found her", and keeps repeating, "She's here."
luke_skywalker Well, who... who has he found?
c3po Princess Leia.
luke_skywalker The princess? She's here?
han_solo Princess? What's going on?
c3po Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
luke_skywalker Oh, no! We've got to do something.
han_solo What are you talking about?
luke_skywalker The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message... We've got to help her.
han_solo Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here.
luke_skywalker But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?
han_solo I'm not going anywhere.
luke_skywalker They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay.
han_solo Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
luke_skywalker But they're going to kill her!
han_solo Better her than me...
luke_skywalker She's rich.
chewbacca growls.
han_solo Rich?
luke_skywalker Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...
han_solo What?
luke_skywalker Well more wealth that you can imagine.
han_solo I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!
luke_skywalker You'll get it!
han_solo I better!
luke_skywalker You will...
han_solo All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this.
luke_skywalker All right.
han_solo What's your plan?
luke_skywalker Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?
luke_skywalker Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you.
chewbacca growls
luke_skywalker Okay. Han, you put these on.
luke_skywalker sheepishly hands the binders to Han.
han_solo Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind.
c3po Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?
luke_skywalker Lock the door!
han_solo And hope they don't have blasters.
c3po That isn't very reassuring.
luke_skywalker and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.
han_solo and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious glance.
luke_skywalker I can't see a thing in this helmet.
han_solo This is not going to work.
luke_skywalker Why didn't you say so before?
han_solo I did say so before!
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Where are you taking this... thing?
chewbacca growls
luke_skywalker Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.
han_solo Look out! He's loose!
luke_skywalker He's going to pull us all apart.
han_solo Go get him!
han_solo We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here.
han_solo Everything is under control. Situation normal.
INTERCOM_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 What happened?
han_solo Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you?
INTERCOM_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We're sending a squad up.
han_solo Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous.
INTERCOM_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Who is this? What's your operating number?
han_solo Boring conversation anyway.
han_solo Luke! We're going to have company!
leia Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?
luke_skywalker What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.
leia You're who?
luke_skywalker I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
leia Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?
luke_skywalker Come on!
darth_vader He is here...
grand_moff_tarkin Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so?
darth_vader A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
grand_moff_tarkin Surely he must be dead by now.
darth_vader Don't underestimate the power of the Force.
grand_moff_tarkin The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
grand_moff_tarkin Yes.
INTERCOM_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three.
grand_moff_tarkin The princess! Put all sections on alert!
darth_vader Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.
grand_moff_tarkin If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
darth_vader Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.
han_solo Chewie!
chewbacca growls
han_solo Get behind me! Get behind me!
han_solo Can't get out that way.
leia Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
han_solo Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
luke_skywalker See-Threepio! See-Threepio!
c3po Yes sir?
luke_skywalker We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that? I didn't copy!
c3po I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted.
clone_trooper voice Open up in there!
c3po Oh, no!
luke_skywalker and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor.
luke_skywalker There isn't any other way out.
han_solo I can't hold them off forever! Now what?
leia This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
han_solo He's the brains, sweetheart.
luke_skywalker Well, I didn't...
han_solo What the hell are you doing?
leia Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy.
han_solo Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it.
han_solo Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!
han_solo Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there...
luke_skywalker No! wait!
luke_skywalker Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed!
leia Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed.
han_solo Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.
leia It could be worse...
han_solo It's worse.
luke_skywalker There's something alive in here!
han_solo That's your imagination.
luke_skywalker Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that?
han_solo What?
luke_skywalker Help!
han_solo Luke! Luke! Luke!
leia Luke!
leia Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.
luke_skywalker Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.
han_solo Where?
luke_skywalker Anywhere! Oh!!
han_solo Luke! Luke!
leia Grab him!
leia What happened?
luke_skywalker I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...
han_solo I've got a very bad feeling about this.
luke_skywalker The walls are moving!
leia Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something.
luke_skywalker Wait a minute!
luke_skywalker Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?
clone_trooper Take over!
See#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 to him! Look there!
c3po They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them.
FIRST_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Follow me! You stand guard.
c3po Come on!
c3po Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
clone_trooper All right.
luke_skywalker Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!
han_solo Get to the top!
leia I can't
luke_skywalker Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in?
c3po They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured.
c3po Hurry!
han_solo One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it!
leia I'm trying!
c3po Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be?
r2d2 frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.
c3po Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off!
c3po Are you there, sir?
luke_skywalker Threepio!
c3po We've had some problems...
luke_skywalker Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy?
luke_skywalker Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
c3po No. Shut them all down! Hurry!
c3po Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master!
luke_skywalker Threepio, we're all right!
luke_skywalker We're all right. You did great.
luke_skywalker Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?
han_solo Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.
han_solo If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.
luke_skywalker Well, let's get moving!
han_solo Where are you going?
leia No, wait. They'll hear!
han_solo Come here, you big coward!
han_solo Chewie! Come here!
leia Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?
han_solo Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me!
leia It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
han_solo No reward is worth this.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Secure this area until the alert is canceled.
clone_trooper Give me regular reports.
All#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 but two of the stormtroopers leave.
clone_trooper Do you know what's going on?
SECOND_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Maybe it's another drill.
SECOND_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 What was that?
clone_trooper Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.
han_solo There she is.
luke_skywalker See-Threepio, do you copy?
c3po For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.
luke_skywalker We're right above you. Stand by.
leia You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought.
han_solo Nice! Come on!
clone_trooper It's them! Blast them!
han_solo Get back to the ship!
luke_skywalker Where are you going? Come back!
leia He certainly has courage.
luke_skywalker What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on!
luke_skywalker I think we took a wrong turn.
leia There's no lock!
luke_skywalker That oughta hold it for a while.
leia Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge.
luke_skywalker Oh, I think I just blasted it.
leia They're coming through!
luke_skywalker Here, hold this.
leia Here they come!
leia For luck!
c3po Where could they be?
r2d2 beeps
clone_trooper Close the blast doors!
clone_trooper Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!
darth_vader I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete.
darth_vader When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Only a master of evil, Darth.
darth_vader Your powers are weak, old man.
ben_obiwan_kenobi You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
han_solo Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.
han_solo Didn't we just leave this party?
chewbacca growls
han_solo What kept you?
leia We ran into some old friends.
luke_skywalker Is the ship all right?
han_solo Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
darth_vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his group's vantage point.
luke_skywalker Look!
c3po and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's Imperial docking bay.
c3po Come on, Artoo, we're going!
han_solo Now's our chance! Go!
luke_skywalker No!
han_solo Come on!
leia Come on! Luke, its too late!
han_solo Blast the door! Kid!
ben_obiwan_kenobi Run, Luke! Run!
han_solo I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!
chewbacca growls
han_solo We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!
luke_skywalker I can't believe he's gone.
leia There wasn't anything you could have done.
han_solo Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!
han_solo You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!
chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking TIE fighters. The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls as the ship bounces slightly.
Computer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 graphic readouts form on Solo's target screen, as Han reaches for controls.
leia Here they come!
luke_skywalker They're coming in too fast!
Pan#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 with pirateship as two TIE fighters charge through the background. Laserbolts streak from all the craft.
c3po Oooh!
leia We've lost lateral controls.
han_solo Don't worry, she'll hold together.
han_solo You hear me, baby? Hold together!
luke_skywalker Got him! I got him!
han_solo Great kid! Don't get cocky.
leia There are still two more of them out there!
luke_skywalker That's it! We did it!
leia We did it!
c3po Help! I think I'm melting!
grand_moff_tarkin Are they away?
darth_vader They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
grand_moff_tarkin You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.
han_solo Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.
leia That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
han_solo Easy... you call that easy?
leia Their tracking us!
han_solo Not this ship, sister.
leia At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
han_solo What's so important? What's he carrying?
leia The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet!
han_solo It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money!
leia You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!
leia Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
luke_skywalker I care!
luke_skywalker So... what do you think of her, Han?
han_solo I'm trying not to, kid!
luke_skywalker Good...
han_solo Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
luke_skywalker No!
luke_skywalker and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored military speeder.
general_willard You're safe! We had feared the worst.
general_willard When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.
leia We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here.
grand_moff_tarkin Yes.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.
general_dodonna The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
gold_leader Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
general_dodonna Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
general_dodonna The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.
general_dodonna Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
red_two_ That's impossible, even for a computer.
luke_skywalker It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.
general_dodonna Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.
darth_vader This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
man's_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations.
luke_skywalker So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
han_solo That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you.
luke_skywalker Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.
han_solo What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide.
luke_skywalker All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
han_solo Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!
han_solo What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.
leia What's wrong?
luke_skywalker Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind.
leia He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
luke_skywalker I only wish Ben were here.
red_three_ Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!
luke_skywalker Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there with you! Listen, have I got some stories to tell...
red_leader a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born leader.
red_leader Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?
red_three_ Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.
red_leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of his fighter.
red_leader I met your father once when I was just a boy, he was a great pilot. You'll do all right. If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.
luke_skywalker Thank you, sir. I'll try.
red_leader hurries to his own ship.
red_three_ I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back. All right?
luke_skywalker I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.
red_three_ You did, all right. It's going to be like old times, Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!
chief#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one?
luke_skywalker Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo?
chief#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Okay, easy she goes!
c3po Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back.
r2d2 beeps
c3po You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
All#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 final preparations are made for the approaching battle. The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Luke, the Force will be with you.
MASSASSI_INTERCOM_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Stand-by alert. Death Star approaching. Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes.

red_leader Lock S-foils in attack position. We're passing through their magnetic field.
red_leader Switch your deflectors on. Double front!
red_two_ Look at the size of that thing!
red_leader Cut the chatter, Red Two.
red_leader I copy, gold_leader.
gold_leader We're starting for the target shaft now.
red_leader We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire.
leia listens to the battle over the intercom. Threepio is at her side.
red_two_ Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees.
red_leader I see it. Stay low.
luke_skywalker This is Red Five; I'm going in!
red_three_ Luke, pull up!
luke_skywalker I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.
ASTRO-officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!
darth_vader We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters.
red_leader Luke, let me know when you're going in.
luke_skywalker I'm on my way in now...
red_leader Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.
luke_skywalker I'm on it.
leia surrounded by her generals and aides, paces nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna watches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working over a screen speaks into his headset.
CONTROL_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way.
luke_skywalker My scope's negative. I don't see anything.
red_leader Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up.
red_three_ I can't see it! Where is he?!
red_three_ see the TIE ship behind him and swings around, trying to avoid him.
red_three_ He's on me tight, I can't shake him... I can't shake him.
luke_skywalker Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.
luke_skywalker Got him!
darth_vader Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me!
red_three_ Pull in! Luke... pull in!
red_two_ Watch your back, Luke!
red_two_ Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in!
luke_skywalker I'm hit, but not bad.
luke_skywalker voice Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there.
Green#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 laserfire moves past the beeping little robot as his head turns.
luke_skywalker nervously works his controls.
red_leader Red Six...
red_leader Can you see Red Five?
red_ten#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you?
luke_skywalker I can't shake him!
red_two_ I'm on him, Luke!
red_two_ Hold on!
luke_skywalker Blast it! Wedge where are you?
luke_skywalker Thanks, Wedge.
red_three_ Good shooting, Wedge!
gold_leader Red Leader...
gold_leader This is gold_leader. We're starting out attack run.
red_leader I copy, gold_leader. Move into position.
darth_vader Stay in attack formation!
gold_leader The exhaust post is...
gold_leader ...marked and locked in!
gold_five is a pilot in his early fifties with a very battered helmet that looks like it's been through many battles. He looks around to see if enemy ships are near. His fighter is buffeted by Imperial flak.
gold_leader races down the enormous trench that leads to the exhaust port. Laserbolts blast toward him in increasing numbers, occasionally exploding near the ship causing it to bounce about.
gold_leader Switch power to front deflector screens.
gold_leader How many guns do you think, Gold Five.
gold_five I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers.
MASSASSI_INTERCOM_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Death Star will be in range in five minutes.
gold_leader pulls his computer targeting device down in front of his eye. Laserbolts continue to batter the Rebel craft.
gold_leader Switching to targeting computer.
gold_two Computer's locked. Getting a signal.
gold_two The guns... they've stopped!
gold_five Stabilize your read deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.
gold_leader They've coming in! Three marks at two ten.
darth_vader I'll take them myself! Cover me!
wingMAN'S_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Yes, sir.
gold_leader looks over his shoulder at the scene.
gold_leader panics.
gold_leader I can't maneuver!
gold_five the old veteran, trys to calm gold_leader.
gold_five Stay on target.
gold_leader We're too close.
gold_five Stay on target!
gold_leader Loosen up!
gold_leader ship is hit by Vader's laser.
gold_five moves in on the exhaust port.
gold_five Gold Five to Red Leader...
gold_five Lost Tiree, lost Dutch.
gold_five They came from behind...
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by?
grand_moff_tarkin Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!
voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Rebel base, three minutes and closing.
red_leader Red Group, this is Red Leader.
red_leader Rendezvous at mark six point one.
red_two_ This is Red Two. Flying toward you.
red_three_ Red Three, standing by.
red_leader this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run.
red_leader voice Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal... to start your run.
red_leader This is it!
red_ten#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We should be able to see it by now.
red_ten'S#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 voice Red Five, can you see them from where you are?
luke_skywalker No sign of any... wait!
luke_skywalker Coming in point three five.
red_ten#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I see them.
red_leader I'm in range.
red_leader Just hold them off for a few seconds.
darth_vader Close up formation.
red_ten#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 You'd better let her loose.
red_leader Almost there!
red_ten#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I can't hold them!
red_nine'S#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 voice
red#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 It's a hit!
red_leader Negative.
red_leader Negative! It didn't go in. It just impacted on the surface.
red_leader we're right above you. Turn to point...
luke_skywalker ...oh-five; we'll cover for you.
red_leader Stay there...
red_leader ...I just lost my starboard engine.
red_leader Get set to make your attack run.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Rebel base, one minute and closing.
luke_skywalker Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle.
red_two_ Right with you, boss.
luke_skywalker It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.
red_three_ We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
red_two_ My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it?
luke_skywalker Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle!
red_two_ What about the tower?
luke_skywalker You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower!
luke_skywalker Artoo... that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down!
leia and the others are grouped around the computer board.
red_two_ I'm hit! I can't stay with you.
luke_skywalker Get clear, Wedge.
luke_skywalker You can't do any more good back there!
darth_vader Let him go! Stay on the leader!
red_three_ Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them!
luke_skywalker Artoo, try and increase the power!
red_three_ Hurry up, Luke!
red_three_ Wait!

ben_obiwan_kenobi Let go, Luke.
ben_obiwan_kenobi Luke, trust me.
BASE_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong?
luke_skywalker Nothing. I'm all right.

luke_skywalker I knew you'd come back! I just knew it!
han_solo Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
leia Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.
luke_skywalker Oh, no!
c3po Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you?
technician#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We'll get to work on him right away.
c3po You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
luke_skywalker He'll be all right.

kaydel_ko_connix Forget the ammunition, there's no time. Just get everyone on the transport. Oh, no.
peavey We've caught them in the middle of their evacuation.
armitage_hux I have my orders from Supreme Leader Snoke himself. This is where we snuff-out the resistance once and for all. Tell Captain Canady to prime his dreadnought. Incinerate their base, destroy their transports and obliterate their fleet.
monitor General, Resistance ship approaching. Launching shields in attack mode.
armitage_hux A single light fighter?
poe Happy beeps here, buddy, come on.
poe We've pulled crazier stunts than this.
leia Just for the record, Commander Dameron, I'm with the droid on this one.
poe Thank you for your support, General.
poe Happy beeps. Attention! This is Commander Poe Dameron of the Republic fleet, I have an urgent communique for General Hux.
lank paze Patch him through.
armitage_hux This is General Hux of the First Order. The Republic is no more. Your fleet are rebel scum and war criminals. Tell your precious princess there will be no terms... there will be no surrender.
poe Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.
hux This is Hux. You and your friends are doomed! We will wipe your filth from the galaxy.
poe OK, I'll hold.
armitage_hux Hello?
poe Hello? Yup. I'm still here.
armitage_hux Can you.... can he hear me? The officer lank paze nods from the bridge pit.
poe Hugs?
armitage_hux He can.
poe With an 'H'. Skinny guy. Kinda pasty.
armitage_hux I can hear you. Can you hear me?
poe Look, I can't hold forever. If you reach him.... tell him Leia has an urgent message for him.
peavey I believe he's tooling with you, sir.
poe About his mother.
armitage_hux Open fire!
poe BB-8, punch it!
peavey He's going for the dreadnought.
armitage_hux Ha! He's insane.
poe Wa-hoo! That's got a kick.
poe All right, taking out the cannons now. Tallie, start your approach.
tallie Copy that.
armitage_hux Captain Canady, why aren't you blasting that puny ship?
canady That 'puny ship' is too small and at too close range. We need to scramble our fighters! Five bloody minutes ago.
goneril He'll never penetrate our armor.
canady He's not trying to penetrate our armor. He's clearing out our surface cannons.
poe There's one cannon left. And here comes the parade.
poe Yeah, yeah, I see 'em!
poe No no. Dammit! BB-8, my weapon systems are down. We gotta take out that last cannon... or our bombers are toast. Make your magic work, buddy.
canady Are the auto cannons primed?
goneril Primed and ready, sir.
canady What are we waiting for? Fire on the base!
kaydel_ko_connix Punch it!
kayden ko connix The last transport is in the air, the evacuation is complete.
leia You did it, Poe. Now get your squad back here so we can get out of this place.
poe No, General... We can do this. We have... a chance to take down a dreadnought.
poe These things are fleet killers. We can't let it get away.
leia Disengage now... Commander, that is an order...
c-3po the golden droid from Tatooine stands next to Leia
leia Wipe that nervous expression off your face, 3PO.
c-3po Oh. Well, I'll certainly try, General. Nervous?
poe Let's go, BB-8... It's now or never!
poe Yeeeaaahh-ho! All clear, bring the bombs!
bascus Captain... Resistance bombers approaching.
canady Of course they are.
tallie Bombers, keep that tight formation. Fighters, protect the bombers. It's not every day we get a shot at a dreadnought, so make this count.

armitage_hux Excellent. I'll take it in my chambers.
snoke General Hux.
armitage_hux Ah, good. Supreme leade-
snoke My disappointment... in your performance can not be overstated.
armitage_hux They can't get away, Supreme Leader. We have them tied on the end of a string.
finn Rey!
poe Well done, pal. "Finn naked leaking bag"? What? Did you fry a chip? Finn! Hey, buddy. It's so good to see you. What? Let's uh... We need to get you dressed. Come on. You must have a thousand questions.
finn Where is Rey?
rey Master Skywalker? Master Skywalker? I'm from the Resistance. Your sister Leia sent me. We need your help. Hello?
luke Go away. Chewie, what are you doing here?
rey He said you're coming back with us.
luke How did you find me?
rey Long story we'll tell you in the Falcon.
luke Falcon? Wait. Where is Han?
snoke Tied to a string, indeed, General Hux. Well done. The Resistance will soon be in our grasp.
armitage_hux Thank you, Supreme Leader.
snoke you wonder why I keep a rabid cur in a such a place of power? The cur's weakness, properly manipulated... Can be a sharp tool. How's your wound?
kylo_ren It's nothing.
snoke Hmm. The mighty Kylo Ren. When I found you... I saw what all masters live to see. Raw, untamed power. And beyond that, something truly special. The potential of your bloodline. A new Vader. Now I fear... I was mistaken.
kylo_ren I've given everything I have to you. To the dark side.
snoke Take that ridiculous thing off.
snoke Yes, there it is. You have too much of your father's heart in you, young Solo.
kylo_ren I killed Han Solo. When the moment came I didn't hesitate.
snoke And look at you, the deed split your spirit to the bone. You were unbalanced... Bested by a girl who had never held a lightsaber! You failed!
snoke Skywalker lives. The seed of the Jedi Order lives. As long as it does, hope lives in the galaxy. I thought you would be the one to snuff it out. Alas, you're no Vader. You're just a child in a mask.
kylo_ren Prepare my ship.
rey There is no light left in Kylo Ren. He's only getting stronger. The First Order will control all the major systems within weeks. We need your help. We need the Jedi Order back. We need Luke Skywalker.
luke You don't need Luke Skywalker.
rey Did you hear a word I just said?
luke You think what? I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword and face down the whole First Order? What did you think was going to happen here? You think that I came to the most unfindable place in the galaxy for no reason at all? Go away.
rey I'm not leaving without you!
rey Careful!
luke You are wasting your time.
luke Who are you?
rey I know this place.
luke Built a thousand generations ago... to keep these. The original Jedi texts. Just like me, they're the last of the Jedi religion. You've seen this place. You've seen this island.
rey Only in dreams.
luke Who are you?
rey The Resistance sent me.
luke They sent you? What is special about you? Where are you from?
rey Nowhere.
luke No ones from nowhere.
rey Jakku.
luke All right, that is pretty much nowhere. Why are you here, Rey, from nowhere?
rey The Resistance sent me. We need your help. The First Order has become unstoppable.
luke Why are you here?
rey Something inside me has always been there Then now it's awake. And I'm afraid. I do not know what it is... or what to do with it. And I need help.
luke You need a teacher. I can't teach you.
rey Why not? I've seen your daily routine. You're not busy.
luke I will never train another generation of Jedi. I came to this island to die. It's time for the Jedi to end.
rey Why? Leia sent me here with hope. If she was wrong, she deserves to know why. We all do.
leia You're demoted.
poe What? Wait! We took down a dreadnought.
leia At what cost?
poe If you start an attack, you follow through.
leia Poe, get your head out of your cockpit. There are things you can not solve... By jumping into an X-wing and blowing something up! I need you to learn that.
poe There were heroes on that mission.
leia Dead heroes, No leaders.
finn We're really nowhere. How's Rey going to find us now? A cloaked binary beacon?
leia To light her way home.
finn Alright, Well, until she comes back, what's the plan?
leia We need to find a new base.
larma One with enough power to get a distress signal to our allies. scattered in the Outer Rim.
ackbar Proximity alert!
resistance female soldier They found us.
poe That's impossible. It's Snoke's ship. You've gotta be kidding me. Can we jump to lightspeed?
kaydel_ko_connix We have enough fuel for just one jump.
poe Do it. We have to get out of here.
leia Wait. They tracked us through lightspeed.
finn That's impossible.
leia Yes. And they've done it.
finn So if we jump to lightspeed... they'll just find us again, and we'll be out of fuel. They've got us.
poe Not yet, they don't. Permission to jump in an X-wing and blow something up?
leia Permission granted. Admiral, spin us around!
ackbar Reverse. Rotate the shields!
RESISTANCE monitor To your stations! Move, move, move!
kylo_ren Follow my lead.
male_announcer Green squadron to launch position. Clear the launch traffic.
poe Don't wait for me! Jump in and fire her up!
male_announcer Technicians, secure supplies for launch conditions.
pilot Move! Move!
finn Poe, are you alright?
poe We need to get outta range of those Star Destroyers.
ackbar We need to what?
leia Full engines ahead. Get out of range of the Star Destroyers and the fighters will fall back.
ackbar All craft, full engines! Concentrate rear shields.
armitage_hux Ren, the Resistance have pulled out of reach. We can't cover you at this distance. Return to the fleet. What is the point of all this if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers?
peavey They are faster and lighter, sir. They can't lose us but they can keep at a range where our cannons are not effective against their shields.
armitage_hux Well, keep up the barrage. Let's at least remind them that we're still here.
peavey Very good sir.
armitage_hux They won't last long burning fuel like this. It's just a matter of time.
poe Move! Outta the way, everybody! Make way! Make room!
medic_droid Her vital signs are weak, but she is fighting.
luke Artoo? Artoo! Yes. Yes I know. Hey, it's a sacred island, watch the language. Old friend. I wish I could make you understand. But I'm not coming back. Nothing can make me change my mind.
leia Years ago, you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. It hurts me not to be able to fulfill my father's request in person...
luke That was a cheap move.
leia IN HOLOGRAM But they are attacking my ship... and I fear that my mission to bring you to Alderaan failed. It is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
luke Tomorrow at dawn. Three lessons. I will teach you the ways of the Jedi... and why they need to end.
larma General Organa... Leia... is unconscious but recovering. This is the only good news I have. Admiral Ackbar... all our leadership, they're gone.
c-3po Oh, dear, oh, dear.
larma Leia was the sole survivor on the bridge. If she were here, she'd say save your sorrow for after the fight. And to that end... The chain of command is clear as to who should take her place. Vice Admiral Holdo... of the cruiser Ninka.
amilyn_holdo Thank you, Commander. There are four hundred of us... on three ships. We're the very last of the Resistance But we're not alone. In every corner of the galaxy... the downtrodden and oppressed know our symbol... and they put their hope in it. We are the spark that will ignite the fire that will restore the Republic. That spark... this Resistance, must survive. That is our mission. Now, to your stations. And may the Force be with us.
poe That's Admiral Holdo? Battle of Chyron Belt, Admiral Holdo? Not what I expected. Vice Admiral? Commander Dameron. With our current fuel consumption... there is a very limited amount time... That we will stay out of range of those Star Destroyers.
amilyn_holdo Very kind to make me aware.
poe Let's get me those fuel projections. And we need to shake them before we find a new base, so... What's our plan?
amilyn_holdo Our plan, captain? Not commander, right? Wasn't it Leia's last official act to demote you? Because of your dreadnought plan... Where we lost our entire bombing fleet?
poe "Captain." "Commander." You can call me whatever you like. I just want to know what's going on.
amilyn_holdo Of course you do. I understand. I've dealt with plenty of trigger happy flyboys like you... You are impulsive. Dangerous. And the last thing we need right now. So stick to your post... and follow my orders.

rose What are you doing here?
finn Hey, hi. Uh, I was... Uh, you know...
rose You are Finn! The Finn!
finn The Finn?
rose Sorry... I work behind pipes all day. Doing talking with the Resistance heroes is not my forte. Doing... Doing talking, yeah... I'm Rose.
finn Breathe.
rose OK.
finn Yeah, look I'm not a Resistance hero, but... It was nice talking to you, Rose. May the Force be with you.
rose Wow. You too. Good. But you are a hero. You left the First Order-what you did on the Starkiller Base. When we heard about it, my sister Paige said... "Rose, that's a real hero." "Know right from wrong.... "and don't run away from when it gets hard," she said. You know... Just this morning, I had to stun... three people who were trying to jump ship. In this escape pod.
finn What?
rose They were running away.
finn That's disgraceful.
rose I know.
finn Anyway, uh... I gotta get back to what I was doing, so.
rose What were you doing?
finn Just, just, uh checks.
rose Checking the escape pods.
finn No, it's routine checks.
rose While boarding one... with a packed bag.
finn Okay. Listen, I... I can't move. I can't move.
rose I know.
finn What happened?
rose I'm taking you to the bridge and turning you in for desertion.
finn I was not deserting. - I told you that...
rose My sister just died... protecting the fleet. And you were running away.
finn I'm sorry. This fleet is doomed... If my friend comes back to it, she's doomed too. I've gotta get this... I've gotta get this beacon very far away from here, then she'll find me and be safe.
rose You're a selfish traitor.
finn Look, we cannot outrun the First Order fleets.
rose We can jump to light speed!
finn Well they can track us through lightspeed.
rose They can track us through lightspeed?
finn Yeah. They'll just show up 30 seconds later and we'll have blown a ton of fuel. Of which, by the way, we're dangerously short on.
rose They can track us through lightspeed.
finn Yes. And they could... I can't feel my teeth. What did you shoot me with?
rose Active tracking.
finn What now?
rose New hyperspace tracking... Hyperspace tracking is a new tactic but the principal must be the same as any active tracker.
finn So they're just tracking us...
rose Only tracking us...
finn AND rose From the lead ship.
rose But we can't get to the tracker. It is an A-class process they'll control from the main bridge.
finn Well, I mean, yes, but every A-class process...
finn AND rose Has a dedicated power breaker.
rose But... Wait, but who knows where the breaker room is on the Star Destroyer?
finn I'm the guy who used to mop it. If I can get us there....
rose I can shut their tracker down.
poe Just give it to me one more time, but simpler.
finn So the First Order's only tracking us from one Destroyer, the main one.
poe So we make blow that one up?
finn I like where you're heading, but no. They'd only start tracking us from another Destroyer.
rose But if we can....
finn If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer and disable the tracker without them realizing, then we can...
rose They won't realize if it's for one system cycle. About six minutes.
finn Sneak on board. Disable the tracker Our fleet escapes before they even realize.
poe How did you two meet?
rose Just luck.
poe Yeah? Good luck?
rose Not sure yet.
finn Poe, we've got to do this It will save the fleet and it'll save Rey.
c-3po If I surely must be the voice of reason... Admiral Holdo will never agree to this plan.
poe Yeah, you're right, 3PO. It's a need-to-know plan, and she doesn't.
c-3po That was not exactly...
poe All right... You guys shut down that tracker. I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed. The question is... How do we sneak the two of you onto Snoke's destroyer?
rose We steal clearance codes.
finn No, they are Bio-Hexaencripted and rescrambled every hour. We can't get through their security shields undetected. Nobody can.
maz Could I do it? Of course I could do it. But I can't do it, I'm a little tied down right now.
finn Maz? What is happening?
maz A union dispute, you do NOT want to hear about it. But, lucky for you... There's exactly one guy I trust that can crush that kind of security! He is a master codebreaker, an ace pilot... a poet with a blaster.
c-3po Oh my. It seems that this codebreaker can practically do everything.
maz Oh yes, he can. You will find him with a red ploom flower on his lapel... rolling on a high stakes table... in the casino... on Canto Bight.
poe Canto Bight? - No, no. That's... Maz... Is there any way we can take care of this ourselves?
maz I'm sorry, kiddo. This is rarified cracking. If you want to get on that Destroyer, I know only one option. Find the master codebreaker.
kylo_ren You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me. You're not doing this. The effort would kill you. Can you see my surroundings?
rey You are going to pay for what you did!
kylo_ren I can't see yours. Just you. So no. This is something else. Luke.
luke What's that about?
rey I was cleaning my blaster. It went off.
luke Let's get started.
rey Who were those things?
luke Caretakers. Island natives. They've kept up the Jedi structures since they've been built.
rey I don't think they like me.
luke I can't imagine why.
rey Master Skywalker, we need you to bring the Jedi back because Kylo Ren is strong with the dark side of the Force. Without the Jedi, we won't stand a chance against him.
luke What do you know about the Force?
rey It's a power that Jedi have that lets them control people and make things float.
luke Impressive. Every word in that sentence was wrong. Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed. The Force is not a power you have. It's not about lifting rocks. It's the energy between all things, a tension, a balance, that binds the universe together.
rey OK. But what is it?
luke Close your eyes. Breathe. Now, reach out.
rey I feel something.
luke You feel it?
rey Yes, I feel it.
luke It's the Force.
rey Really?
luke Wow, it must be really strong with you.
rey I've never felt anythi----OW! You meant reach out like.... I'll try again.
luke Breathe. Just breathe. Reach out with your feelings. What do you see?
rey The island. Life. Death and decay, that feeds new life. Warmth. Cold. Peace. Violence.
luke And between it all?
rey Balance. And energy. A Force.
luke And inside you?
rey Inside me the same Force.
luke And this is the lesson. That Force does not belong to the Jedi. To say that if the Jedi die, the light dies, is vanity. Can you feel that?
rey There's something else beneath the island. A place. A dark place.
luke Balance. Powerful light, powerful darkness.
rey It's cold. It's calling me.
luke Resist it, Rey. Rey? Rey! You went straight to the dark.
rey That place was trying to show me something.
luke It offered you something you needed. And you didn't even try to stop yourself.
rey But I didn't see you. Nothing from you. You've closed yourself off from the Force. Of course you have.
luke I've seen this raw strength only once before, in Ben Solo. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now.
amilyn_holdo What was that?
kaydel_ko_connix Nothing, Admiral. Passing debris.
finn The fleet's only got 18 hours of fuel left. We gotta hurry.
rey Still can't reach the Resistance? Keep at it. If you get through, check their status. And ask about Finn.
kylo_ren Why is the Force connecting us? You and I.
rey Murderous snake. You're too late. You lost. I found Skywalker.
kylo_ren Did he tell you what happened? The night I destroyed his temple, did he tell you why?
rey I know everything I need to know about you.
kylo_ren You do? Ah, you do. You have that look in your eyes. From the forest. When you called me a monster.
rey You are a monster.
kylo_ren Yes, I am.
rose OK. We get in, we find this codebreaker, we get out.
finn Do you know this town? Canto Bight?
rose From stories. It's a terrible place filled with the worst people in the galaxy.
finn Great.
slowen lo I told those two, I said, "This is a public beach. You can't park that shuttle." But they just lit off toward the casino.
thamm Place your bets. Place your bets. All the bets on the table right now, right now! Place your bets here.
finn Aw, yes! This place is great!
rose OK. Maz says that this Master Codebreaker would have a red plom bloom on his lapel. Let's find him and get out of here.
thamm Well played. The house wins. Where are your manners, more like?
rose Come on!
finn We've covered this whole casino. Zero red plom blooms. Where is this guy?
rose Were those what I think they are?
finn What are those things?
rose Fathiers. I've never seen a real one.
finn Look, this whole place is beautiful. I mean, come on. Why do you hate it so much?
rose Look closer. My sister and I grew up in a poor mining system. The First Order stripped our ore to finance its military.... then shelled us to test their weapons. They took everything we had. And who do you think these people are? There's only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich.
finn War.
rose Selling weapons to the First Order. I wish I could put my fist through this whole lousy, beautiful town. Red plom bloom!
finn Red plom bloom!
rose The Master Codebreaker!
slowen lo Yup, those are the shuttle parkers.
cop All right, You two are under arrest for parking violation 27B/6. You have the right to remain....
lovey What was that?
master codebreaker No, no, no. Not now, Lovey. I'm on a roll.
luke Lesson Two. Now that they're extinct, the Jedi are romanticized, defied. But if you strip away the myth and look at their deeds, the legacy of the Jedi is failure. Hypocrisy, hubris.
rey That's not true.
luke At the height of their powers, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise, create the Empire, and wipe them out. It was a Jedi Master who was responsible for the training and creation of Darth Vader.
rey And a Jedi who saved him. Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy. But you saw that there was conflict inside him. You believed that he wasn't gone. That he could be turned.
luke And I became a legend. For many years, there was balance.... and then I saw Ben. My nephew with that mighty Skywalker blood. And in my hubris, I thought I could train him, I could pass on my strengths. Han was Han about it, but Leia trusted me with her son. I took him, and a dozen students, and began a training temple. By the time I realized I was no match for the darkness rising in him, it was too late.
rey What happened?
luke I went to confront him. And he turned on me. Ben, no! He must have thought I was dead. When I came to, the temple was burning. He had vanished with a handful of my students. And slaughtered the rest. Leia blamed Snoke, but it was me. I failed. Because I was Luke Skywalker. Jedi master. A legend.
rey The galaxy may need a legend. I need someone to show me my place in all this. And you didn't fail Kylo. Kylo failed you. I won't.
peavey The main cruiser's still keeping beyond range. But their medical frigate is out of fuel and its shields are down.
armitage_hux The beginning of their end. Destroy it.
MEDICAL FRIGATE pilot The last of our crew has been evacuated and heading your way. It's been an honor, Admiral. Godspeed, Rebels!
kaydel_ko_connix Admiral, fuel reserves at six hours.
amilyn_holdo Maintain our current course. Steady on.
poe Finn, Rose, where are you guys?
cop Deal me in. Thanks.
rose Finn, the fleet is running on fumes. Without a codebreaker to break us onto Snoke's Star Destroyer.... what do we do?
finn I don't know. Unless you got a thief in your pocket, our plan is shot.
dj Um, I can do it.
rose What?
finn What?
rose What?
dj S-S-S-Sorry, I'm just couldn't help but overhear all the stuff that you were saying really loudly while I trying to sleep. Codebreaker? Thief? I can do it.
finn I'm not talking about picking pockets, OK?
dj Yeah. D-D-D-Don't let the wrapper fool you, friend. Me and the First Order codeage go way back. And, if the price is right, I could break you into old man S-S-S-Snoke's boudoir.
finn No.
rose We're.... We've got it covered.
dj Ha-tuk-ga.
finn Did he just....?
rose Yeah. We gotta get outta here! This way!
cop Why, you little....
dj D-D-D-Did you do this?
cop Hey, hands up! Hands up!
dj Yeah, man. What's your story, roundie?
cop_1 They went this way! Lock down all the exits.
cop_2 Wait.
finn That smells great. Those cops will be here any minute. What now? Whoa! Ooh!
rose No, wait. Please stop! We're with the Resistance.
cop_1 Roger that. Checking the stables now.
cop_2 This way.
cop_3 They must have come through here.
rose Hyah!
TEMIRI BLAGG - Go, go, go! Whoo!
finn Stop enjoying this, stop enjoying this!
SPEEDER pilot We've got them. They aren't going anywhere.
finn AND rose Ahhhh!
finn Huh?
rose Move, move, move! Get outta the way!
finn Our ship's on the beach straight ahead! We need cover! Too much cover! There it is!
finn AND rose No!
finn Come on!
SPEEDER pilot Let the flock go. Stick with the perps. Where'd they go?
finn I think we lost them! Now we go down to the beach and circle back around....
rose Cliff! We're trapped.
finn It was worth it, though. To tear up that town, make 'em hurt.
rose Go. Now, it's worth it.
SPEEDER pilot There they are.
finn BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing?
dj N-N-N-Need a lift?
leia Luke.
luke Leia.
rey I'd rather not do this now.
kylo_ren Yeah, me too.
rey Why did you hate your father? Do you have something, a cowl or something you can put on? Why did you hate your father? Give me an honest answer. You had a father who loved you, he gave a damn about you.
kylo_ren I didn't hate him.
rey Then why?
kylo_ren Why, what? Why, what? Say it.
rey Why did you... Why did you kill him? I don't understand.
kylo_ren No? Your parents threw you away like garbage.
rey They didn't!
kylo_ren They did. But you can't stop needing them. It's your greatest weakness. Looking for them everywhere.... in Han Solo.... now in Skywalker. Did he tell you what happened that night?
rey Yes.
kylo_ren No. He had sensed my power, as he senses yours. And he feared it.
rey Liar.
kylo_ren Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. That's the only way to become what you were meant to be.
rey No! No!
female voice Rey?
rey I should have felt trapped or panicked. But I didn't. This didn't go on forever, I knew it was leading somewhere. And that, at the end, it would show me what I came to see.
female voice Rey.
rey Let me see them. My parents... please. I thought I'd find answers here. I was wrong. I've never felt so alone kylo ren You're not alone.
rey Neither are you.
luke Rey?
rey It isn't too late.
luke Stop!
rey It is true? Did you try to murder him?
luke Leave this island now!
rey Stop. Stop! Did you do it? Did you create Kylo Ren? Tell me the truth.
luke I saw darkness. I'd sensed it building in him. I'd see it at moments during his training. But then I looked inside... and it was beyond what I ever imagined. Snoke had already turned his heart. He would bring destruction, and pain, and death... and the end of everything I love because of what he will become. And for the briefest moment of pure instinct... I thought I could stop it. It passed like a fleeting shadow. And I was left with shame... and with consequence. And the last thing I saw... were the eyes of a frightened boy whose master had failed him. Ben, no!
rey You failed him by thinking his choice was made It wasn't There is still conflict in him If he turned from the dark side, that could shift the tide. This could be how we win.
luke This is not going to go the way you think.
rey It is. Just now, when we touched hands... I saw his future. As solid as I'm seeing you. If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.
luke Rey... don't do this.
rey Then he is our last hope.
luke Master Yoda.
yoda Young Skywalker.
luke I'm ending all of this. The tree, the text, the Jedi. I'm going to burn it down.
yoda Hmm. Ah, Skywalker, missed you, have I.
luke So it is time for the Jedi Order to end.
yoda Time it is. For you to look at a pile of old books, hmmm?
luke The sacred Jedi texts!
yoda Oh. Read them, have you?
luke Well, I...
yoda Page-turners they were not. Yes, yes, yes. Wisdom they held, but that library contained nothing that the girl Rey does not already possess. Skywalker, still looking to the horizon. Never here, now, hmmm? The need in front of your nose. Hmmm?
luke I was weak. Unwise.
yoda Lost Ben Solo, you did. Lose Rey, we must not.
luke I can't be what she needs me to be.
yoda Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you have learned. Strength, mastery. But weakness, folly, falure, also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke, we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.
finn Four parsecs to go. This thing really cooks.
rose I just hope we're in time. You can actually do this, right?
dj Yeah, about that... Guys, I can do it. But there exists a pre-"do it" conversation about price.
rose Once we're done, the Resistance will give you whatever you want.
dj What you got deposit-wise?
finn Are you kidding me? Look at us.
dj Is that Haysian smelt? That's something.
finn No, we gave you our word. You're gonna get paid. That should be enough.
dj Guys, I wanna keep helping. But no something, n-n-n-no doing.
finn OK, listen here, you've gotta....
rose Do it.
dj Now I can help.
finn Give it back.
dj What?
finn Give it back! You have no idea how much that medallion means to her. What are you.... Why are you ransacking your own ship? It's not your ship.
dj He says I stole it.
finn Yeah, I got that.
dj We stole it.
finn At least you're stealing from the bad guys and helping the good.
dj Good guys, bad guys, made-up words. Let's see who formally owned this gorgeous hunk-uh. Ah, this guy was an arms dealer. Made his bank selling weapons to the bad guys. Oh.... and the good. Finn, let me learn you something big. It's all a machine, partner. Live free, don't join.
peavey That was the last of their support ships. It's just their main cruiser now.
armitage_hux And their fuel reserve?
peavey By our calculations.... critical.
poe She in there?
larma The Admiral's banned you from the bridge. Let's not have a scene.
poe No, let's. Holdo?
larma You're not allowed in here.
holdo Flyboy.
poe Cut it, lady. We had a fleet, now we're down to one ship, and you've told us nothing! Tell us that we have a plan! That there's hope!
holdo When I served under Leia, she would say, hope is like the sun. If you only believe in it when you can see it....
poe You'll never make it through the night.
holdo Yes.
poe Are you fueling up the transports? You are. All of them? We're abandoning ship? Is that.... That's what you got? That's what you brought us to? Coward! Those transports ships are unarmed, unshielded. We abandon this cruiser, we're done. We don't stand a chance. No, you are not just a coward, you are a traitor.
holdo Get this man off my bridge.
poe Finn, Holdo's loading the crew in the shuttles. She's going to abandon ship. Where are you?
finn Poe, we're on our way back to the fleet. We're so close.
poe Did you find the Master Codebreaker?
finn We found a codebreaker. We can shut the tracker down. Just buy us a little more time.
poe All right, hurry.
rey As soon as I launch, you jump back out of range. Stay there until you get my signal for where to rendezvous. If you see Finn before I do, tell him... Yeah, perfect. Tell him that.
dj Cloaking our approach. We should be off their scopes. Then we slice a slit in their shield. Blip bloppity bloop, and slip right through.
amilyn_holdo So a stormtrooper, and a who now are doing what?
poe They are trying to save us. This is our best chance for escape. You have to give Finn and Rose all the time that you can.
amilyn_holdo You have bet the survival of the Resistance on bad odds and put us all at risk? There's no time now. We have to get clear of the cruiser. Load the transports.
crew member Right away, Admiral.
poe Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that. Vice Admiral Holdo, I am relieving you of your command for the survival of this ship, its crew, and the Resistance.
amilyn_holdo I hope you understand what you're doing.
poe Yeah. I'm going to the bridge. If they move, stun them.
officer #1 ....at least three cycles so far.
officer #2 Yes, sir. We're working on it.
officer #3 I will do my best, sir.
finn Almost there.
rey You don't have to do this. I feel the conflict in you. It's tearing you apart. Ben, when we touched hands, I saw your future. Just the shape of it, but solid and clear. You will not bow before Snoke. You will turn. I'll help you. I saw it.
kylo_ren I saw something, too. Because of what I saw, I know when the moment comes, you'll be the one to turn. You'll stand with me. Rey, I saw who your parents are.
snoke Well done, my good and faithful apprentice. My faith in you is restored. Young Rey. Welcome.
finn So this is it? The tracker's right behind this door.
dj Haysian smelt. Best conductor. And you're welcome.
rose Good time to figure out how to get back to the fleet?
finn I know where the nearest escape pods are.
rose Course you do.
poe BB-8, tell me something good.
finn Poe, we're almost there. Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed.
poe Yeah, I'm on it pal. You just hurry. Clear the bridge, escort the officers down to the hangar.
c-3po Commander.... Captain Dameron, Admiral Holdo was looking for you.
poe Yeah, we spoke.
c-3po Sir, I am almost afraid to ask.
poe Good instinct, 3PO. Go with that. Seal that door!
rose We're running out of time.
finn Come on, how's it going?
dj Almost there.
poe 3PO, where do you think you're going?
c-3po It would be quite against my programming to be party to a mutiny.
poe Hey!
c-3po It is not correct protocol. Oh! Neither is this!
poe Finn? We're ready to make the jump.
finn Now or never.
dj Now.
finn You're up.
stormtrooper #1 You there, hands up!
stormtrooper #2 Watch 'em, watch 'em.
stormtrooper #3 Drop your weapons, now!
stormtrooper #4 Hands up, Rebel scum.
stormtrooper #3 Get down! I said, down!
phasma FN-2187. So good to have you back.
poe They didn't make it. Leia.
announcer Please board the transports according to your evacuation designation. All transports must be cleared....
gurney_operator OK, help me push him up, guys.
amilyn_holdo That one's a troublemaker. I like him.
leia Me, too. Now, time to board your transport.
amilyn_holdo For the transports to escape, someone needs to stay behind and pilot the cruiser.
leia Too many losses. I can't take anymore.
amilyn_holdo Sure you can. You taught me how.
leia AND amilyn holdo May the Force be....
leia You go on. I've said it enough.
amilyn_holdo May the Force be with you always.
pilot Cloaking device activated. We should be off their scopes.
larma Let's hope this works.
snoke Come closer, child. So much strength. Darkness rises, and light to meet it. I warned my young apprentice that as he grew stronger, his equal in the light would rise. Skywalker.... I assumed. Wrongly. Closer, I said.
rey You underestimate Skywalker, and Ben Solo, and me. It will be your downfall.
snoke Oh.... have you seen something? A weakness in my apprentice. Is that why you came? Young fool. It was I who bridged your minds. I stoked Ren's conflicted soul. I knew he was not strong enough to hide it from you. And you were not wise enough to resist the bait. And now, you will give me Skywalker. Then I will kill you with the cruelest stroke.
rey No.
snoke Yes. Give me everything.
rey No! No! No!
poe No. No. No, no, no!
leia Poe.
poe What is that?
larma The mineral planet, Crait. An uncharted hideout from the days of the Rebellion.
poe That's a Rebel base?
larma Abandoned, but heavily armored with enough power to get a distress signal to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim.
leia Holdo knew the First Order was tracking our big ship. They're not monitoring for little transports.
poe So we could slip down to the surface unnoticed and hide till the First Order passes. That could work.
leia She was more interested in protecting the light than she was seeming like a hero.
amilyn_holdo Godspeed, Rebels.
armitage_hux Well done, Phasma.
phasma Your ship and payment, as we agreed.
rose You lying snake.
dj We got caught, I cut a d-d-d-deal.
finn Wait, cut a deal with what?
first_order_officer Sir, we checked on the information from the thief. We ran a decloaking scan, and sure enough, 30 Resistance transports have just launched from the cruiser.
armitage_hux He told us the truth. Will wonders never cease?
rose No.
armitage_hux Our weapons are ready?
first_order_officer Ready and aimed, sir.
armitage_hux Fire at will.
finn Wait. No, no. No, you can't!
rose No!
pilot Admiral, we're taking fire! Do we turn around?
amilyn_holdo No, you're too far out. Full speed to planetfall. Full speed!
snoke Well, well, I did not expect Skywalker to be so wise. We will give him and the Jedi Order the death he desires. After the Rebels are gone, we will go to his planet and obliterate the entire island. Such spunk. Look here now. The entire Resistance on those transports. Soon they will all be gone. For you, all is lost. Ooh. And still that fiery spit of hope. You have the spirit of a true Jedi! And because of that, you must die. My worthy apprentice, son of darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader. Where there was conflict, I now sense resolve. Where there was weakness, strength. Complete your training, and fulfill your destiny.
kylo_ren I know what I have to do.
rey Ben.
snoke You think you can turn him? Pathetic child. I cannot be betrayed, I cannot be beaten. I see his mind, I see his every intent. Yes. I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true. And now, foolish child, he ignites it, and kills his true enemy!
poe Come on, give it full thrusters. Full speed!
cova nell I am, sir.
finn You murdering bastard!
dj T-T-T-Take it easy, Big F. They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow. It's just business.
finn You're wrong.
dj Maybe.
rey Ben! The fleet. Order them to stop firing. There's still time to save the fleet. Ben?
kylo_ren It's time to let old things die. Snoke, Skywalker. The Sith, the Jedi, the Rebels.... let it all die. Rey. I want you to join me. We can rule together and bring a new order to the galaxy.
rey Don't do this, Ben. Please don't go this way.
kylo_ren No, no. You're still holding on! Let go! Do you wanna know the truth about your parents? Or have you always known? And you've just hidden it away. You know the truth. Say it. Say it.
rey They were nobody.
kylo_ren They were filthy junk traders who sold you off for drinking money. They're dead in a paupers' grave in the Jakku desert. You have no place in this story. You come from nothing. You're nothing. But not to me. Join me. Please.
first_order_officer Sir, the Resistance cruiser's preparing to jump to lightspeed.
armitage_hux It's empty. They're just trying to pull our attention away. Pathetic. Keep your fire on the transports.
phasma Execution by blaster is too good for them. Let's make this hurt.
rose Finn.
phasma On my command.
kaydel_ko_connix She's running away.
poe No, she isn't.
EDRISON peavey No!
armitage_hux Fire on that cruiser!
phasma Execute.
rose Finn! There's a shuttle back that way! We gotta go!
phasma Traitor! What?
rose Finn!
phasma You are a bug in the system.
finn Let's go, chrome-dome. Come on!
rose No!
finn Hey.
phasma You were always scum.
finn Rebel scum.
rose Hey! Need a lift?
armitage_hux What happened?
kylo_ren The girl murdered Snoke. What happened?
armitage_hux She took Snoke's escape craft.
kylo_ren We know where she's going. Get all our forces down to that Resistance base. Let's finish this.
armitage_hux Finish this? Who do you think you're talking to? You presumed to command my army? Our Supreme Leader is dead! We have no ruler!
kylo_ren The Supreme Leader is dead.
armitage_hux Long live the Supreme Leader.
leia They're coming, shut the door.
resistance soldier Incoming!
poe Go, go, move! Get that shield door down!
rose No! Wait, don't shoot! It's us! No, don't shoot!
poe Hold your fire!
finn Don't shoot!
poe Hold your fire!
leia Finn?
poe Finn! Rose! You're not dead! Where's my droid? Buddy! I'm so glad to see you! Wait, what? Wait, wait, wait, slow down.
rose Is this all that's left?
poe All right, our shields are up so they can't hit us from orbit. Use whatever power we've got left to broadcast a distress signal to the Outer Rim.
leia Use my personal code. If there are any allies to the Resistance, it's now or never.
poe Rose, what do you got?
rose Rotting munitions, rusted artillery, some half-gutted skim speeders.
poe Well, let's just pray that big-ass door holds long enough for us to get help.
finn A battering ram cannon.
poe A what now?
finn Miniaturized Death Star tech. It'll crack that door open like an egg.
rose There has to be a back way out of here, right?
poe BB-8, what do you got?
c-3po BB-8 has analyzed the mine's schematics. This is the only way in or out.
finn Come on. We have allies. People believe in Leia. They'll get our message, they'll come. But we have to buy time. We gotta take out that cannon.
soldier_1 On me! On me!
soldier_2 Move! Move!
resistance trooper Go back! Gather your weapons!
soldier_3 Get over here!
soldier_4 Hold your fire!
salty Salt.
soldier_5 Ground forces, incoming.
poe Copy that, on our way.
rose Engage your mono-ski. The green toggle.
poe All right, listen up. I don't like these rust buckets and I don't like our odds, but.... what the hell? Just keep it tight and don't get drawn in too close till they roll that cannon up front. All right, ground forces, lay down some fire!
armitage_hux 13 incoming light craft. Shall we hold until we clear them?
kylo_ren No. The Resistance is in that mine. Push through.
poe Fighters, break off! Come on! We gotta hold them till they pull up that cannon!
finn Rose, you've got 3 right behind you!
rose I can't lose 'em!
finn Whoo! Yeah!
rey Whoo! I like this!
kylo_ren Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!
armitage_hux All fighters!
rey Chewie, pull off from the battle. Draw them away from the speeders.
poe She drew 'em off! All of 'em!
finn Oh, they hate that ship!
rey Chewie!
rose There it is! That is a big gun.
finn OK, it's heavily armored. Our only shot is right down the throat. The cannon's opening. This is our chance.
kylo_ren All firepower on those speeders.
armitage_hux Concentrate all fire on the speeders!
resistance controller We're taking heavy losses.
poe They're picking us all off. We're not gonna make it.
finn All right, making my final approach. Target in sight, guns are hot.
poe No! Pull off!
finn What?
poe The cannon is charged! It's a suicide run! All craft, pull away!
finn No! I'm almost there!
poe Retreat, Finn! That's an order!
rose Finn? It's too late! Don't do this!
finn No! I won't let them win!
rose No! Finn, listen to Poe! We have to retreat!
male_scout The cannon is warming up now.
male_commander Copy that. We see it.
male_scout Preparing to fire.
poe Move! Go, go! Quick!
soldier Let's go, let's go!
finn Rose? Rose? Rose? Why would you do that? Huh? I was almost there. Why would you stop me?
rose I saved you, dummy. That's how we're gonna win. Not fighting what we hate, saving what we love.
kylo_ren General Hux, advance. No quarter. No prisoners.
kaydel_ko_connix Our distress signal's been received at multiple points, but no response.
larma They've heard us, but no one's coming.
leia We fought till the end. But the galaxy has lost all its hope. The spark is out. Luke. I know what you're gonna say. I changed my hair.
luke It's nice that way. Leia, I'm sorry.
leia I know. I know you are. I'm just glad you're here at the end.
luke I came to face him, Leia. And I can't save him.
leia I held out hope for so long, but I know my son is gone.
luke No one's ever really gone.
c-3po Master Luke.
kylo_ren Stop! I want every gun we have to fire on that man. Do it. More! More!
armitage_hux That's enough. That's enough! Do you think you got him? Now, if we're ready to get moving, we can finish this.
SHUTTLE_pilot Sir?
kylo_ren Bring me down to him. Keep the door covered and don't advance until I say.
armitage_hux Supreme Leader, don't get distracted, our goal....
SHUTTLE_pilot Right away, sir.
finn Med pack! I need a med pack!
poe She's hurt pretty bad. It's Kylo Ren. Luke's facing him alone.
finn Well, we should help him. Let's go.
poe No, wait. Wait.
kylo_ren Did you come back to say you forgive me? To save my soul?
luke No.
poe He's doing this for a reason. He's stalling so we can escape.
finn Escape? He's one man against an army. We have to help him, we have to fight.
poe No, no. We are the spark that'll light the fire that will burn the First Order down. Skywalker's doing this so we can survive. There's gotta be a way out of this mine. Hell, how did he get in here?
c-3po Sir, it is possible that a natural unmapped opening exists. But this facility is such a maze of endless tunnels that the odds of finding an exit are 15,428....
poe Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up. Shut up!
c-3po To one.
poe Listen.
c-3po My audio sensors no longer detect the....
poe Exactly.
finn Where'd the crystal critters go?
poe Follow me.
leia What are you looking at me for? Follow him.
rey If the beacon's right beneath us, they've gotta be somewhere. Keep scanning for life forms.
poe This way.
rey I see them! Chewie, there!
poe No. No, no, no. No!
rey Lifting rocks.
luke I failed you, Ben. I'm sorry.
kylo_ren I'm sure you are! The Resistance is dead. The war is over. And when I kill you, I will have killed the last Jedi.
luke Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong. The Rebellion is reborn today. The war is just beginning. And I will not be the last Jedi.
kylo_ren I'll destroy her, and you, and all of it.
luke No. Strike me down in anger and I'll always be with you. Just like your father.
kylo_ren No.
luke See you around, kid.
kylo_ren No!
poe C'ai!
c-3po Such a friend.
leia Chewie!
rey It looks good.
kaydel_ko_connix That was crazy, man.
poe Hi.
rey Hi.
poe I'm Poe.
rey Rey.
poe I know.
larma When we get to the Outer Rim, I have a contact there.
c-3po Quite definately possible.
rey Luke is gone. I felt it. But it wasn't sadness or pain. It was peace and purpose.
leia I felt it, too.
rey How do we build a Rebellion from this?
leia We have everything we need.
oniho_zaya Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master.

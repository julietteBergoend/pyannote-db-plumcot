anakin_skywalker Lock on to him, R2.
not_available Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead the one crawling with vulture droids.
obiwan_kenobi I see it.
obiwan_kenobi Oh, this is going to be easy.
obiwan_kenobi Oddball, do you copy?
r2d2 Copy, Red Leader.
obiwan_kenobi Mark my position.
obiwan_kenobi Form your squad up behind me.
r2d2 We're on your tail, General Kenobi.
r2d2 Set S-foils in attack position.
anakin_skywalker This is where the fun begins.
obiwan_kenobi Let them pass between us.
not_available They're all over me.
not_available Get them off my I'm gonna go help them out.
not_available No.
obiwan_kenobi They are doing theirjob so we can do ours.
anakin_skywalker Missiles.
anakin_skywalker Pull up.
obiwan_kenobi They overshot us.
anakin_skywalker They're coming around.
obiwan_kenobi All right, R4.
obiwan_kenobi No, no.
obiwan_kenobi Nothing too fancy.
not_available Surge all power units, R2.
not_available Stand by reverse thrusters.
not_available We got 'em, R2.
obiwan_kenobi Flying is for droids.
obiwan_kenobi I'm hit.
not_available Anakin?
anakin_skywalker I see them.
not_available Buzz droids.
obiwan_kenobi R4, be careful.
not_available You have a Oh, dear.
obiwan_kenobi They're shutting down all the controls.
not_available Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
obiwan_kenobi The mission.
obiwan_kenobi Get to the command ship.
obiwan_kenobi Get the chancellor.
obiwan_kenobi I'm running out of tricks here.
not_available In the name of Hold your fire!
obiwan_kenobi You're not helping.
not_available I agree.
anakin_skywalker Bad idea.
obiwan_kenobi I can't see a thing.
obiwan_kenobi My cockpit's fogging.
not_available They're all over me.
not_available Anakin!
anakin_skywalker Move to the right.
not_available Hold on.
not_available You'll get us both killed.
obiwan_kenobi Get out of here.
obiwan_kenobi There's nothing more you can do.
anakin_skywalker I'm not leaving without you, Master.
not_available Get him, R2.
anakin_skywalker Watch out.
not_available R2, hit the buzz droid's centre eye.
anakin_skywalker Yeah, you got him!
obiwan_kenobi Great, R2.
anakin_skywalker The general's command ship is dead ahead.
obiwan_kenobi Have you noticed the shields are still up?
anakin_skywalker Sorry, Master.
not_available I have a bad feeling about this.
plo_koon There they are.
clone_trooper Get them.
obiwan_kenobi R2, locate the chancellor.
not_available The chancellor's signal is coming from right there the observation platform at the top of that spire.
anakin_skywalker I sense Count Dooku.
obiwan_kenobi I sense a trap.
anakin_skywalker Next move?
obiwan_kenobi Spring the trap.
anakin_skywalker R2, go back.
anakin_skywalker I need you to stay with the ship.
not_available Here.
obiwan_kenobi Take this and wait for orders.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 What's the situation, Captain?
captain_raymus_antilles Two Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
not_available We're tracking them.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Just as Count Dooku predicted.
anakin_skywalker Destroyers.
battle_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Drop your weapons.
battle_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I said drop 'em.
droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Roger.
droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Roger, roger.
not_available Those are Jedi fighters all right.
obiwan_kenobi Did you press the stop button?
not_available No.
not_available Did you?
anakin_skywalker There's more than one way out of here.
obiwan_kenobi We don't want to get out.
obiwan_kenobi We want to get moving.
not_available R2, activate elevator 31174.
not_available Come in, R2.
not_available What that?
not_available R2, do you copy?
not_available R2, activate the elevator number 31174.
super_battle_droid_2#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Get back to work.
not_available That nothin'.
not_available Activate the elevator 31174.
not_available R2 Always on the move.
obiwan_kenobi R2, switch on the comlink.
not_available R2, can you hear me?
not_available R2?
not_available R2!
not_available R2!
not_available Stop.
not_available Stop.
obiwan_kenobi R2, we need to be going up.
droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Hands up, Jedi.
not_available R2, do you copy?
obiwan_kenobi R2, do you hear me?
obiwan_kenobi R2, we need to be going up, not down.
super_battle_droid_1#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Hey, you!
obiwan_kenobi That's better.
super_battle_droid_1#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You stupid little astro droid.
not_available Oh, it's you.
not_available My eyes!
not_available My eyes!
anakin_skywalker What was that all about?
not_available R2 has been No loose wire jokes.
obiwan_kenobi Did I say anything?
anakin_skywalker He's trying.
obiwan_kenobi I didn't say anything.
not_available Chancellor.
not_available Are you all right?
not_available Count Dooku.
obiwan_kenobi This time we will do it together.
anakin_skywalker I was about to say that.
the_emperor Get help.
the_emperor You're no match for him.
the_emperor He's a Sith lord.
not_available Chancellor Palpatine, Sith lords are our speciality.
count_dooku Your swords, please.
count_dooku We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the chancellor.
obiwan_kenobi You won't get away this time, Dooku.
count_dooku I've been looking forward to this.
anakin_skywalker My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
not_available Good.
count_dooku Twice the pride, double the fall.
not_available Get I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.
count_dooku You have hate.
count_dooku You have anger.
count_dooku But you don't use them.
the_emperor Good, Anakin.
not_available Good.
not_available Kill him.
the_emperor Kill him now.
anakin_skywalker I shouldn't.
not_available Do it.
the_emperor You did well, Anakin.
the_emperor He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
anakin_skywalker Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
anakin_skywalker I shouldn't have done that.
anakin_skywalker It's not the Jedi way.
the_emperor It is only natural.
the_emperor He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge.
not_available It wasn't the frst time, Anakin.
the_emperor Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People?
the_emperor Now we must leave before more security droids arrive.
not_available Anakin, there's no time.
not_available We must get off this ship before it's too late.
anakin_skywalker He seems to be all right.
the_emperor Leave him, or we'll never make it.
anakin_skywalker His fate will be the same as ours.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Prepare for attack!
not_available All batteries, fire!
not_available Fire!
anakin_skywalker Elevator's not working.
not_available R2, activate elevator 3224.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Reverse stabilizers.
not_available Reversing stabilizers.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Magnetize!
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Magnetize!
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Fire the emergency booster engines.
not_available We're levelling out, sir.
not_available Easy.
not_available We're in a bit of a situation here.
obiwan_kenobi Did I miss something?
not_available Hold on.
obiwan_kenobi What is that?
not_available Oops.
not_available R2.
anakin_skywalker R2, shut down the elevator.
not_available Too late.
obiwan_kenobi Jump!
not_available Let's see if we can fnd something in the hangar bay that's still flyable.
anakin_skywalker R2, get down here.
not_available R2, do you copy?
naboo_royal_security_guard#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 General, we found the Jedi.
naboo_royal_security_guard#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 They're in hallway 328.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Activate ray shields.
not_available Ray shields.
obiwan_kenobi Wait a minute.
not_available How did this happen?
obiwan_kenobi We're smarter than this.
anakin_skywalker Apparently not.
not_available I say patience.
not_available Patience?
not_available Yes.
not_available R2 will be along in a few moments and then he'll release the ray shields.
not_available See?
anakin_skywalker No problem.
not_available Don't move.
not_available Do you have a plan B?
not_available Ah, yes.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 The negotiator.
not_available General Kenobi.
not_available We've been waiting for you.
not_available Excuse me.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 That wasn't much of a rescue.
not_available You're welcome.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 And Anakin Skywalker.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.
not_available General Grievous.
anakin_skywalker You're shorter than I expected.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Jedi scum.
not_available We have a job to do, Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi Try not to upset him.
not_available Your lightsabres will make a fne addition to my collection.
obiwan_kenobi Not this time.
obiwan_kenobi And this time, you won't escape.
not_available R2.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Crush them!
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Make them suffer!
not_available Come.
not_available Now!
not_available Stay at your stations!
clone_trooper Get him!
clone_trooper Get him!
not_available Run!
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Don't bother with them.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Keep the ship in orbit.
not_available Yes, sir.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You lose, General Kenobi.
obiwan_kenobi Get out of here!
not_available Run!
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Time to abandon ship.
anakin_skywalker All the escape pods have been launched.
not_available Grievous.
obiwan_kenobi Can you fly a cruiser like this?
not_available You mean, can I land what's left of it?
not_available Well?
anakin_skywalker Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.
anakin_skywalker Strap yourselves in.
anakin_skywalker Open all hatches.
not_available Extend all flaps and drag fns.
anakin_skywalker We lost something.
obiwan_kenobi Not to worry.
not_available We are still flying half a ship.
anakin_skywalker Now we're really picking up speed.
not_available Eight plus 60.
obiwan_kenobi We're in the atmosphere.
anakin_skywalker Grab that.
anakin_skywalker Keep us level.
not_available Steady.
anakin_skywalker Easy, R2.
obiwan_kenobi Fire ships on the left and the right.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 We'll take you in.
obiwan_kenobi Copy that.
not_available Landing strip, straight ahead.
anakin_skywalker We're coming in too hot.
obiwan_kenobi Another happy landing.
anakin_skywalker Coming, Master?
not_available No.
obiwan_kenobi I'm not brave enough for politics.
obiwan_kenobi I have to report to the council.
obiwan_kenobi Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
not_available Hold on.
anakin_skywalker This whole operation was your idea.
not_available Let us not forget, Anakin, that you rescued me from the buzz droids.
not_available And you killed Count Dooku, and you rescued the chancellor carrying me unconscious on your back.
anakin_skywalker All because of your training.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, let's be fair.
not_available Today you were the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
not_available All right.
not_available But you owe me one, and not for saving your skin for the 10th time.
obiwan_kenobi Ninth time.
not_available That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't count.
not_available I'll see you at the briefng.
not_available Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?
not_available Yes.
the_emperor Thanks to your two Jedi knights.
the_emperor They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.
mace_windu General Grievous will run and hide, as he always does.
not_available He's a coward.
the_emperor But with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the droid army.
the_emperor And I assure you the senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.
not_available Then the Jedi Council will make fnding Grievous our highest priority.
not_available Watch it.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Come along, R2.
senator_bail_organa The Republic cannot praise you enough.
anakin_skywalker Thank you, Senator Organa.
c3po It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.
not_available Now there I agree with you.
c3po In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.
not_available But the fighting will continue until General Grievous is spare parts.
not_available I will do everything I can in the senate.
not_available Excuse me.
not_available Certainly.
not_available I've missed you, Padm.
not_available There were whispers that you'd been killed.
anakin_skywalker I'm all right.
anakin_skywalker It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime.
not_available And it might have been, if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.
anakin_skywalker I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges.
not_available Wait.
padme Not here.
anakin_skywalker Yes, here.
anakin_skywalker I'm tired of all this deception.
anakin_skywalker I don't care if they know we're married.
padme Anakin, don't say things like that.
not_available Are you all right?
anakin_skywalker You're trembling.
not_available What's going on?
padme Something wonderful has happened.
not_available Ani, I'm pregnant.
anakin_skywalker That's wonderful.
not_available What are we gonna do?
not_available We're not gonna worry about anything right now.
not_available All right?
anakin_skywalker This is a happy moment.
anakin_skywalker The happiest moment of my life.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Yes, Lord Sidious?
the_emperor General Grievous I suggest you move the separatist leaders to Mustafar.
not_available It will be done, my lord.
the_emperor The end of the war is near, General.
not_available But the loss of Count Dooku His death was a necessary loss.
not_available Soon I will have a new apprentice one far younger and more powerful.
not_available Ani, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo.
not_available We can go to the lake country where no one will know where we can be safe.
not_available I can go early and fx up the baby's room.
padme I know the perfect spot.
padme Right by the gardens.
anakin_skywalker You are so beautiful.
padme It's only because I'm so in love.
anakin_skywalker No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
padme So love has blinded you?
anakin_skywalker That's not exactly what I meant.
padme But it's probably true.
padme Anakin, help me!
padme What's bothering you?
not_available Nothing.
anakin_skywalker I remember when I gave this to you.
not_available How long is it gonna take for us to be honest with each other?
anakin_skywalker It was a dream.
not_available Bad?
anakin_skywalker Like the ones I used to have about my mother, just before she died.
not_available And?
not_available And it was about you.
not_available Tell me.
not_available It was only a dream.
anakin_skywalker You die in childbirth.
not_available And the baby?
not_available I don't know.
not_available It was only a dream.
anakin_skywalker I won't let this one become real.
padme This baby will change our lives.
padme I doubt the queen will continue to allow me to serve in the senate.
not_available If the council discovers you're the father, you'll be expelled I know.
not_available I know.
padme Do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?
not_available We don't need his help.
anakin_skywalker Our baby is a blessing.
yoda Premonitions?
yoda Premonitions.
not_available These visions you have They're of pain, suffering.
not_available Death.
yoda Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
not_available Someone.
yoda Close to you?
not_available Yes.
yoda Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin.
yoda The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
anakin_skywalker I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
yoda Death is a natural part of life.
yoda Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force.
yoda Mourn them, do not.
yoda Miss them, do not.
yoda Attachment leads to jealousy.
yoda The shadow of greed that is.
anakin_skywalker What must I do, Master Yoda?
yoda Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
not_available You've missed the report on the outer rim sieges.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I was held up.
anakin_skywalker I have no excuse.
obiwan_kenobi In short, they are going very well.
obiwan_kenobi Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
anakin_skywalker What's wrong, then?
obiwan_kenobi The senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today.
anakin_skywalker That can only mean less deliberating and more action.
anakin_skywalker Is that bad?
not_available It'll make it easier for us to end this war.
obiwan_kenobi Be careful of your friend Palpatine.
anakin_skywalker Be careful of what?
obiwan_kenobi He has requested your presence.
anakin_skywalker What for?
obiwan_kenobi He would not say.
not_available He didn't inform the council?
anakin_skywalker That's unusual, isn't it?
obiwan_kenobi All of this is unusual.
obiwan_kenobi And it's making me feel uneasy.
the_emperor I hope you trust me, Anakin.
not_available Of course.
the_emperor I need your help, son.
not_available What do you mean?
the_emperor I'm depending on you.
anakin_skywalker For what?
not_available I don't understand.
the_emperor To be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic.
the_emperor I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
not_available Me?
not_available A master?
not_available I'm overwhelmed, sir.
anakin_skywalker But the council elects its own members.
not_available They'll never accept this.
the_emperor I think they will.
not_available They need you.
the_emperor More than you know.
yoda Allow this appointment lightly the council does not.
yoda Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
not_available I understand.
mace_windu You are on this council but we do not grant you the rank of master.
not_available What?
anakin_skywalker How can you do this?
anakin_skywalker This is outrageous.
anakin_skywalker It's unfair.
anakin_skywalker How can you be on the council and not be a master?
mace_windu Take a seat, young Skywalker.
anakin_skywalker Forgive me, Master.
not_available We have surveyed all systems in the Republic but have found no sign of General Grievous.
yoda Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.
yoda The outlying systems you must sweep.
obiwan_kenobi We do not have many ships to spare.
kiadimundi What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
mace_windu It is critical we send an attack group there immediately.
obiwan_kenobi He's right.
not_available It's a system we cannot afford to lose.
yoda Go I will.
yoda Good relations with the Wookiees I have.
not_available It's settled then.
mace_windu Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.
mace_windu May the Force be with us all.
anakin_skywalker What kind of nonsense is this?
anakin_skywalker Put me on the council and not make me a master?
not_available It's never been done in the history of the Jedi.
anakin_skywalker It's insulting.
obiwan_kenobi Calm down, Anakin.
not_available You have been given a great honour.
not_available To be on the council at your age it's never happened before.
not_available The fact of the matter is you are too close to the chancellor.
obiwan_kenobi The council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
anakin_skywalker I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the council.
obiwan_kenobi But it's what you wanted.
obiwan_kenobi Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
anakin_skywalker That has nothing to do with this.
obiwan_kenobi The only reason the council has approved your appointment is because the chancellor trusts you.
not_available And?
not_available Anakin, I am on your side.
not_available I didn't want to put you in this situation.
anakin_skywalker What situation?
not_available The council wants you to report on all the chancellor's dealings.
obiwan_kenobi They want to know what he's up to.
anakin_skywalker They want me to spy on the chancellor?
not_available But that's treason.
obiwan_kenobi We are at war, Anakin.
anakin_skywalker Why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session?
obiwan_kenobi This assignment is not to be on record.
anakin_skywalker The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.
anakin_skywalker He befriended me.
anakin_skywalker He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
obiwan_kenobi That is why you must help us.
not_available Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in offce long after his term has expired.
anakin_skywalker The senate demanded that he stay longer.
obiwan_kenobi Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi Something is out of place.
anakin_skywalker You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code.
anakin_skywalker Against the Republic.
not_available Against a mentor and a friend.
anakin_skywalker That's what's out of place here.
anakin_skywalker Why are you asking this of me?
obiwan_kenobi The council is asking you.
not_available Anakin did not take to his new assignment with much enthusiasm.
mace_windu It's very dangerous, putting them together.
mace_windu I don't think the boy can handle it.
mace_windu I don't trust him.
obiwan_kenobi With all due respect, Master, is he not the chosen one?
obiwan_kenobi Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
mace_windu So the prophecy says.
not_available A prophecy that misread could have been.
obiwan_kenobi He will not let me down.
obiwan_kenobi He never has.
yoda I hope right you are.
anakin_skywalker Sometimes I wonder what's happening to the Jedi order.
anakin_skywalker I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
padme Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
not_available What do you mean?
not_available What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists and the Republic has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?
anakin_skywalker I don't believe that.
anakin_skywalker And you're sounding like a separatist.
padme This war represents a failure to listen.
padme Now you're closer to the chancellor than anyone.
not_available Please, ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
anakin_skywalker Don't ask me to do that.
anakin_skywalker Make a motion in the senate, where that kind of a request belongs.
not_available What is it?
not_available Nothing.
padme Don't do this.
padme Don't shut me out.
not_available Let me help you.
padme Hold me.
padme Like you did by the lake on Naboo.
not_available So long ago, when there was nothing but our love.
not_available No politics, no plotting, no war.
anakin_skywalker You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
the_emperor Yes, Anakin.
the_emperor Come closer.
the_emperor I have good news.
the_emperor Our clone intelligence units have discovered the location of General Grievous.
not_available He's hiding in the Utapau system.
not_available At last.
anakin_skywalker We'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.
not_available I would worry about the collective wisdom of the council if it didn't select you for this assignment.
not_available You're the best choice, by far.
the_emperor Sit down.
the_emperor Leave us.
the_emperor You know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council.
the_emperor If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.
anakin_skywalker I'm not sure I understand.
the_emperor You must sense what I have come to suspect.
the_emperor The Jedi Council want control of the Republic.
the_emperor They're planning to betray me.
not_available I don't think that Anakin.
the_emperor Search your feelings.
the_emperor You know, don't you?
anakin_skywalker I know they don't trust you.
the_emperor Or the senate.
the_emperor Or the Republic.
the_emperor Or democracy, for that matter.
anakin_skywalker I have to admit, my trust in them has been shaken.
not_available Why?
the_emperor They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?
the_emperor They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?
anakin_skywalker I don't know what to say.
the_emperor Remember back to your early teachings.
not_available All who gain power are afraid to lose it.
the_emperor Even the Jedi.
anakin_skywalker The Jedi use their power for good.
the_emperor Good is a point of view, Anakin.
the_emperor The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way including their quest for greater power.
anakin_skywalker The Sith rely on their passion for their strength.
not_available They think inwards only about themselves.
the_emperor And the Jedi don't?
anakin_skywalker The Jedi are selfless.
anakin_skywalker They only care about others.
the_emperor Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
the_emperor I thought not.
the_emperor It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.
the_emperor It's a Sith legend.
not_available Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life.
not_available He had such a knowledge of the dark side he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
anakin_skywalker He could actually save people from death?
the_emperor The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
anakin_skywalker What happened to him?
not_available He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was Iosing his power.
the_emperor Which eventually, of course, he did.
the_emperor Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew.
the_emperor Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.
the_emperor It's ironic.
the_emperor He could save others from death but not himself.
anakin_skywalker Is it possible to learn this power?
the_emperor Not from a Jedi.
not_available All Red units, over here!
kiadimundi Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau?
anakin_skywalker A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the chairman of Utapau.
yoda Act on this we must.
yoda The capture of General Grievous will end this war.
yoda Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
anakin_skywalker The chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
mace_windu The council will make up its own mind who is to go not the chancellor.
yoda A master is needed, with more experience.
not_available I concur.
kiadimundi Master Kenobi should go.
not_available I agree.
not_available Aye.
not_available Aye.
not_available Very well.
not_available Council adjourned.
clone_trooper The droids have started up their main power generators.
yoda Then now the time is, Commander.
not_available Yes, sir.
obiwan_kenobi Charge!
not_available Head for cover!
not_available You're gonna need me on this one.
not_available I agree.
obiwan_kenobi However, it may turn out Just to be a wild bantha chase.
not_available Master.
anakin_skywalker I've disappointed you.
not_available I haven't been very appreciative of your training.
not_available I've been arrogant, and I apologize.
anakin_skywalker I've just been so frustrated with the council.
obiwan_kenobi You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you.
obiwan_kenobi I have trained you since you were a small boy.
obiwan_kenobi I have taught you everything I know.
obiwan_kenobi And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be.
obiwan_kenobi But be patient, Anakin.
not_available It will not be long before the council makes you a Jedi master.
not_available Obi-Wan.
not_available May the Force be with you.
obiwan_kenobi Goodbye, old friend.
not_available May the Force be with you.
boba_fett Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here.
boba_fett On the far side.
obiwan_kenobi I'll keep them distracted until you get there.
obiwan_kenobi Just don't take too long.
not_available Come on.
boba_fett When have I ever let you down?
not_available Very well.
not_available The burden is on me not to destroy all the droids until you arrive.
obiwan_kenobi Save your energy.
not_available I can't.
obiwan_kenobi Don't give up, Padm.
anakin_skywalker Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?
padme He came by this morning.
anakin_skywalker What did he want?
padme He's worried about you.
not_available He says you've been under a lot of stress.
not_available I feel lost.
not_available Lost?
not_available What do you mean?
anakin_skywalker Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.
padme They trust you with their lives.
anakin_skywalker Something's happening.
not_available I'm not the Jedi I should be.
anakin_skywalker I want more.
anakin_skywalker And I know I shouldn't.
padme You expect too much of yourself.
not_available I found a way to save you.
padme Save me?
anakin_skywalker From my nightmares.
padme Is that what's bothering you?
anakin_skywalker I won't lose you, Padm.
not_available I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.
not_available I promise you.
anakin_skywalker No, I promise you.
tion_medon Greetings, young Jedi.
tion_medon What brings you to our remote sanctuary?
obiwan_kenobi Unfortunately, the war.
not_available There's no war here unless you brought it with you.
obiwan_kenobi With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.
tion_medon He is here.
tion_medon We are being held hostage.
tion_medon They are watching us.
not_available I understand.
not_available Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.
obiwan_kenobi Tell your people to take shelter.
obiwan_kenobi If you have warriors, now is the time.
not_available Take the fighter back to the ship.
obiwan_kenobi Tell Cody I've made contact.
not_available Is he bringing additional warriors?
tion_medon He didn't say.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the outer rim.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 It is a volcanic planet.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You will be safe there.
not_available Safe?
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General.
not_available Without Count Dooku, I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Your ship is waiting.
obiwan_kenobi Hello there.
not_available General Kenobi.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You are a bold one.
not_available Kill him.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Back away.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
not_available Your move.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You fool.
not_available I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Attack, Kenobi.
general_grievous#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Army or not you must realize you are doomed.
obiwan_kenobi I don't think so.
not_available Cover that corner.
boba_fett Master Windu, may I interrupt?
boba_fett General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous and we have begun our attack.
mace_windu Thank you, Commander.
mace_windu Anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor.
mace_windu His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.
not_available Yes, Master.
mace_windu I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.
mace_windu The dark side of the Force surrounds the chancellor.
kiadimundi If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous then he should be removed from office.
mace_windu The Jedi Council would have to take control of the senate in order to secure a peaceful transition.
yoda To a dark place this line of thought will carry us.
yoda Great care we must take.
not_available Chancellor.
not_available We've just received a report from Master Kenobi.
anakin_skywalker He has engaged General Grievous.
the_emperor We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
anakin_skywalker I should be there with him.
not_available It's upsetting to me to see that the council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents.
the_emperor Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi master?
anakin_skywalker I wish I knew.
not_available More and more I get the feeling that I'm being excluded from the council.
not_available I know there are things about the Force that they're not telling me.
the_emperor They don't trust you, Anakin.
the_emperor They see your future.
the_emperor They know your power will be too strong to control.
the_emperor You must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you.
the_emperor Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
anakin_skywalker How do you know the ways of the Force?
the_emperor My mentor taught me everything about the Force.
the_emperor Even the nature of the dark side.
anakin_skywalker You know the dark side?
the_emperor If one is to understand the great mystery one must study all its aspects not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi.
the_emperor If you wish to become a complete and wise leader you must embrace a larger view of the Force.
the_emperor Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.
the_emperor Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi.
not_available Learn to know the dark side of the Force and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
anakin_skywalker What did you say?
the_emperor Use my knowledge.
the_emperor I beg you.
not_available You're the Sith lord.
not_available I know what's been troubling you.
not_available Listen to me.
the_emperor Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council.
the_emperor Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.
not_available A life of signifcance of conscience.
the_emperor Are you going to kill me?
anakin_skywalker I would certainly like to.
the_emperor I know you would.
the_emperor I can feel your anger.
the_emperor It gives you focus makes you stronger.
not_available I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
not_available Of course.
not_available You should.
the_emperor But you're not sure of their intentions, are you?
anakin_skywalker I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
the_emperor You have great wisdom, Anakin.
the_emperor Know the power of the dark side.
the_emperor Power to save Padm.
obiwan_kenobi So uncivilized.
anakin_skywalker Master Windu, I must talk to you.
not_available Skywalker, we just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.
not_available We're on our way to make sure the chancellor returns emergency power back to the senate.
anakin_skywalker He won't give up his power.
anakin_skywalker I've just learned a terrible truth.
anakin_skywalker I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord.
not_available A Sith lord?
not_available Yes.
not_available The one we've been looking for.
mace_windu How do you know this?
anakin_skywalker He knows the ways of the Force.
not_available He's been trained to use the dark side.
mace_windu Are you sure?
not_available Absolutely.
mace_windu Then our worst fears have been realized.
mace_windu We must move quickly if the Jedi order is to survive.
anakin_skywalker Master, the chancellor is very powerful.
not_available You'll need my help if you're going to arrest him.
not_available For you own good, stay out of this affair.
mace_windu I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker.
not_available There is much fear that clouds your judgement.
anakin_skywalker I must go, Master.
not_available No.
not_available If what you've told me is true, you will have gained my trust.
mace_windu But for now, remain here.
not_available Wait in the council chambers until we return.
not_available Yes, Master.
the_emperor You do know, don't you if theJedi destroy me any chance of saving her will be lost.
not_available Master Windu.
the_emperor I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then.
the_emperor I must say you're here sooner than expected.
not_available In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic you're under arrest, Chancellor.
the_emperor Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
mace_windu The senate will decide your fate.
the_emperor I am the senate.
not_available Not yet.
the_emperor It's treason then.
mace_windu You are under arrest, my lord.
not_available Anakin, I told you it would come to this.
the_emperor I was right.
the_emperor The Jedi are taking over.
mace_windu The oppression of the Sith will never return.
mace_windu You have lost.
the_emperor You will die!
not_available He's a traitor!
not_available He is the traitor!
the_emperor I have the power to save the one you love.
the_emperor You must choose.
mace_windu Don't listen to him, Anakin!
the_emperor Don't let him kill me.
not_available I can't hold it any longer.
not_available I can't.
not_available I'm weak.
the_emperor I'm too weak.
not_available Help me.
not_available Help me!
the_emperor I can't hold on any longer.
mace_windu I am going to end this once and for all.
not_available You can't.
anakin_skywalker He must stand trial.
not_available He has control of the senate and the courts.
not_available He's too dangerous to be left alive.
the_emperor I'm too weak.
the_emperor Don't kill me.
not_available Please.
anakin_skywalker It's not the Jedi way.
anakin_skywalker He must live.
the_emperor Please don't.
anakin_skywalker I need him.
the_emperor Please don't!
not_available Power!
the_emperor Unlimited power!
anakin_skywalker What have I done?
not_available You're fulflling your destiny, Anakin.
the_emperor Become my apprentice.
the_emperor Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
anakin_skywalker I will do whatever you ask.
not_available Good.
not_available Just help me save Padm's life.
anakin_skywalker I can't live without her.
the_emperor To cheat death is a power only one has achieved but if we work together I know we can discover the secret.
anakin_skywalker I pledge myself to your teachings.
not_available Good.
not_available Good.
the_emperor The Force is strong with you.
the_emperor A powerful Sith you will become.
not_available Henceforth you shall be known as Darth Vader.
darth_vader Thank you, my master.
not_available Rise.
the_emperor Because the council did not trust you, my young apprentice I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot.
the_emperor When the Jedi learn what has transpired here they will kill us, along with all the senators.
not_available I agree.
not_available The council's next move will be against the senate.
the_emperor Every single Jedi including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi is now an enemy of the Republic.
anakin_skywalker I understand, Master.
not_available We must move quickly.
the_emperor The Jedi are relentless.
the_emperor If they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end.
the_emperor First I want you to go to the Jedi temple.
the_emperor We will catch them off-balance.
the_emperor Do what must be done, Lord Vader.
the_emperor Do not hesitate.
the_emperor Show no mercy.
the_emperor Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padm.
anakin_skywalker What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?
the_emperor Their betrayal will be dealt with.
the_emperor After you have killed all the Jedi in the temple go to the Mustafar system.
the_emperor Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other separatist leaders.
the_emperor Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!
the_emperor And we shall have peace.
not_available Sergeant, over here!
not_available Hurry!
not_available All of them!
not_available All Red units, let's move it!
not_available Come on.
obiwan_kenobi Let's go!
obiwan_kenobi Commander, contact your troops.
obiwan_kenobi Tell them to move to the higher levels.
boba_fett Very good, sir.
boba_fett By the way, I think you'll be needing this.
obiwan_kenobi Thank you, Cody.
obiwan_kenobi Let's get a move on.
obiwan_kenobi We've got a battle to win.
not_available Yes, sir.
the_emperor Commander Cody the time has come.
not_available Execute order 66.
clone_trooper Yes, my lord.
boba_fett Blast him!
not_available Come on!
not_available Execute order 66.
not_available It will be done, my lord.
not_available It will be done, my lord.
jedi_youngling#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Master Skywalker, there are too many of them.
not_available What are we going to do?
not_available The chancellor's offce indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.
not_available Don't worry.
not_available I'm sure he'll be all right.
senator_bail_organa What's going on here?
not_available There's been a rebellion, sir.
not_available Don't worry.
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 The situation is under control.
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I'm sorry, sir.
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 It's time for you to leave.
senator_bail_organa And so it is.
clone_trooper Get him!
not_available Don't worry about him.
not_available Let him go.
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 All these Wookiees are dead.
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Move to the east.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Goodbye, Tarfful.
not_available Goodbye, Chewbacca.
yoda Miss you I will.
not_available Hopefully we'll be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.
not_available Did you fnd Kenobi?
not_available Sir, no one could have survived that fall.
not_available Start loading your men on the ships.
not_available Move it.
not_available Emergency code 913.
obiwan_kenobi I have no contact on any firequency.
not_available Master Kenobi.
obiwan_kenobi Repeat.
not_available Master Kenobi.
not_available Senator Organa.
obiwan_kenobi My clone troops turned on me.
obiwan_kenobi I need help.
senator_bail_organa We havejust rescued Master Yoda.
senator_bail_organa It appears this ambush has happened everywhere.
senator_bail_organa We're sending you our coordinates.
c3po Hush!
c3po Not so loud.
not_available Are you all right?
padme I heard there was an attack on the Jedi temple.
not_available You could see the smoke from here.
not_available I'm fne.
anakin_skywalker I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
not_available What's happening?
anakin_skywalker The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic.
padme I can't believe that.
anakin_skywalker I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the chancellor myself.
not_available What are you gonna do?
anakin_skywalker I will not betray the Republic.
not_available My loyalties lie with the chancellor and with the senate and with you.
padme What about Obi-Wan?
not_available I don't know.
anakin_skywalker Many Jedi have been killed.
anakin_skywalker We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the chancellor.
padme Anakin, I'm afraid.
anakin_skywalker Have faith, my love.
anakin_skywalker Everything will soon be set right.
anakin_skywalker The chancellor has given me a very important mission.
not_available The separatists have gathered on the Mustafar system.
anakin_skywalker I'm going there to end this war.
anakin_skywalker Wait for me until I return.
anakin_skywalker Things will be different.
not_available I promise.
anakin_skywalker Please, wait for me.
c3po Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2.
c3po Take care, my little friend.
not_available Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?
not_available No, thank you, 3PO.
c3po I feel so helpless.
not_available How many other Jedi have managed to survive?
yoda Heard from no one have we.
senator_bail_organa I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi temple.
senator_bail_organa That's why I went looking for Yoda.
obiwan_kenobi Have we had any contact from the temple?
yoda Received a coded retreat message we have.
senator_bail_organa It requests all Jedi to return to the temple.
not_available It says the war is over.
obiwan_kenobi Then we must go back.
not_available If there are any stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.
yoda Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
not_available Yes, Master.
obiwan_kenobi There is too much at stake.
not_available I agree.
not_available And a little more knowledge might light our way.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 The plan has gone as you had promised, my lord.
the_emperor You have done well, Viceroy.
the_emperor When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives he will take care of you.
not_available We're receiving a message from the chancellor's offce, sir.
senator_bail_organa Send it through.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor requests your presence at a special session of Congress.
senator_bail_organa I will be there.
not_available He'll be expecting you.
senator_bail_organa Could be a trap.
obiwan_kenobi I don't think so.
obiwan_kenobi The chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the senate intact.
yoda If a special session of Congress there is easier for us to enter the Jedi temple it will be.
not_available R2, stay with the ship.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Welcome, Lord Vader.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 We've been expecting you.
the_emperor And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.
not_available What's happened?
not_available The chancellor's been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.
the_emperor The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated.
obiwan_kenobi Not even the younglings survived.
yoda Killed not by clones this Padawan.
not_available By a lightsabre he was.
not_available Who?
obiwan_kenobi Who could have done this?
the_emperor The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed.
the_emperor But I assure you.
the_emperor My resolve has never been stronger!
not_available Stop!
not_available In order to ensure the security and continuing stability the Republic will be reorganized into the frst Galactic Empire!
the_emperor For a safe and secure society.
padme So this is how liberty dies.
padme With thunderous applause.
not_available The war is over.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Lord Sidious promised us peace.
not_available We only want I have recalibrated the code, warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.
yoda For the clones to discover the recalibration a long time it will take.
not_available Wait.
not_available Master.
obiwan_kenobi There is something I must know.
not_available If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you fnd.
obiwan_kenobi I must know the truth, Master.
obiwan_kenobi It can't be.
obiwan_kenobi It can't be.
the_emperor You have done well, my new apprentice.
not_available Now, Lord Vader go and bring peace to the Empire.
obiwan_kenobi I can't watch any more.
yoda Destroy the Sith we must.
obiwan_kenobi Send me to kill the emperor.
obiwan_kenobi I will not kill Anakin.
not_available To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough you are not.
obiwan_kenobi He is like my brother.
obiwan_kenobi I cannot do it.
yoda Twisted by the dark side young Skywalker has become.
yoda The boy you trained, gone he is.
yoda Consumed by Darth Vader.
obiwan_kenobi I do not know where the emperor has sent him.
obiwan_kenobi I don't know where to look.
not_available Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and fnd him you will.
obiwan_kenobi When was the last time you saw him?
padme Yesterday.
obiwan_kenobi And do you know where he is now?
not_available Padm, I need your help.
not_available He is in grave danger.
not_available From the Sith?
obiwan_kenobi From himself.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin has turned to the dark side.
not_available You're wrong.
padme How could you even say that?
obiwan_kenobi I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.
padme Not Anakin.
padme He couldn't.
obiwan_kenobi He was deceived by a lie.
obiwan_kenobi We all were.
obiwan_kenobi It appears that the chancellor is behind everything, including the war.
obiwan_kenobi Palpatine is the Sith lord we've been looking for.
obiwan_kenobi After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.
padme I don't believe you.
not_available I can't.
not_available I must fnd him.
padme You're going to kill him, aren't you?
obiwan_kenobi He has become a very great threat.
not_available I can't.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin is the father, isn't he?
obiwan_kenobi I'm so sorry.
not_available Milady, let me come with you.
not_available There's no danger.
not_available The fighting's over.
not_available And this is personal.
not_available As you wish, milady, but I strongly disagree.
padme I'll be all right, Captain.
padme This is something I must do myself.
not_available Besides, 3PO will look after me.
not_available Oh, dear.
not_available Do you know?
c3po I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.
not_available The separatists have been taken care of, my master.
not_available It is fnished then.
the_emperor You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy.
the_emperor Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation.
the_emperor All droid units must shut down immediately.
darth_vader Very good, my lord.
anakin_skywalker I saw your ship.
anakin_skywalker What are you doing out here?
padme I was so worried about you.
padme Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
anakin_skywalker What things?
not_available He said you've turned to the dark side.
padme That you killed younglings.
anakin_skywalker Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
padme He cares about us.
not_available Us?
not_available He knows.
padme He wants to help you.
padme Anakin, all I want is your love.
anakin_skywalker Love won't save you, Padm.
anakin_skywalker Only my new powers can do that.
padme At what cost?
not_available You're a good person.
padme Don't do this.
anakin_skywalker I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.
not_available I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.
not_available And I'm doing it for you.
anakin_skywalker To protect you.
padme Come away with me.
padme Help me raise our child.
padme Leave everything else behind while we still can.
anakin_skywalker Don't you see?
anakin_skywalker We don't have to run away any more.
anakin_skywalker I have brought peace to the Republic.
anakin_skywalker I am more powerful than the chancellor.
anakin_skywalker I can overthrow him.
not_available And together, you and I can rule the galaxy make things the way we want them to be.
padme I don't believe what I'm hearing.
padme Obi-Wan was right.
padme You've changed.
anakin_skywalker I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan.
anakin_skywalker The Jedi turned against me.
anakin_skywalker Don't you turn against me.
padme I don't know you any more.
padme You're breaking my heart.
not_available You're going down a path I can't follow.
anakin_skywalker Because of Obi-Wan?
padme Because of what you've done.
padme What you plan to do.
not_available Stop.
padme Stop now.
not_available Come back.
padme I love you.
anakin_skywalker Liar!
anakin_skywalker You're with him!
anakin_skywalker You brought him here to kill me.
obiwan_kenobi Let her go, Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi Let her go.
anakin_skywalker You turned her against me!
obiwan_kenobi You have done that yourself.
anakin_skywalker You will not take her from me!
obiwan_kenobi Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.
not_available You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
anakin_skywalker Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.
anakin_skywalker I see through the lies of the Jedi.
anakin_skywalker I do not fear the dark side as you do.
not_available I have brought peace fireedom, justice and security to my new empire.
obiwan_kenobi Your new empire?
anakin_skywalker Don't make me kill you.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!
not_available If you're not with me then you're my enemy.
not_available Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
obiwan_kenobi I will do what I must.
anakin_skywalker You will try.
not_available I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.
yoda Or should I call you Darth Sidious?
not_available Master Yoda.
the_emperor You survived.
not_available Surprised?
the_emperor Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda.
the_emperor Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.
the_emperor I have waited a long time for this moment my little green friend.
the_emperor At last the Jedi are no more.
not_available Not if anything to say about it I have.
yoda At an end your rule is.
not_available And not short enough it was.
yoda If so powerful you are why leave?
the_emperor You will not stop me.
the_emperor Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.
yoda Faith in your new apprentice misplaced may be.
yoda As is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
not_available Hurry.
yoda Careful timing we will need.
senator_bail_organa Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.
not_available There's no sign of his body, sir.
mas_amedda Then he is not dead.
the_emperor Double your search.
not_available Yes, sir.
clone_trooper Right away, sir.
the_emperor Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate take-off.
not_available Yes, Master.
the_emperor I sense Lord Vader is in danger.
yoda Into exile I must go.
yoda Failed I have.
obiwan_kenobi I have failed you, Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi I have failed you.
anakin_skywalker I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!
anakin_skywalker From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
obiwan_kenobi Then you are lost!

anakin_skywalker Lock on to him, R2.
anakin_skywalker Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead- the one crawling with vulture droids.
obiwan_kenobi I see it.
obiwan_kenobi Oh, this is going to be easy.
obiwan_kenobi - Oddball, do you copy?
odd_ball#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 - Copy, Red Leader.
obiwan_kenobi Form your squad up behind me.
odd_ball#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 We're on your tail, General Kenobi.
odd_ball#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Set S-foils in attack position.
anakin_skywalker This is where the fun begins.
obiwan_kenobi Let them pass between us.
obiwan_kenobi They're all over me.
obiwan_kenobi No.
obiwan_kenobi They are doing theirjob so we can do ours.
anakin_skywalker Missiles.
anakin_skywalker Pull up.
obiwan_kenobi - They overshot us.
anakin_skywalker - They're coming around.
anakin_skywalker All right, R4.
obiwan_kenobi No, no.
obiwan_kenobi Nothing too fancy.
anakin_skywalker Surge all power units, R2.
anakin_skywalker Stand by reverse thrusters.
anakin_skywalker We got 'em, R2.
obiwan_kenobi Flying is for droids.
obiwan_kenobi - I'm hit.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin?
anakin_skywalker - I see them.
anakin_skywalker Buzz droids.
obiwan_kenobi R4, be careful.
obiwan_kenobi They're shutting down all the controls.
anakin_skywalker Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
obiwan_kenobi The mission.
obiwan_kenobi Get to the command ship.
obiwan_kenobi Get the chancellor.
obiwan_kenobi I'm running out of tricks here.
obiwan_kenobi You're not helping.
anakin_skywalker - I agree.
anakin_skywalker Bad idea.
obiwan_kenobi I can't see a thing.
obiwan_kenobi My cockpit's fogging.
obiwan_kenobi They're all over me.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin!
obiwan_kenobi - Move to the right.
anakin_skywalker - Hold on.
obiwan_kenobi You'll get us both killed.
obiwan_kenobi Get out of here.
obiwan_kenobi There's nothing more you can do.
anakin_skywalker I'm not leaving without you, Master.
anakin_skywalker Watch out.
obiwan_kenobi R2, hit the buzz droid's centre eye.
anakin_skywalker - Yeah, you got him!
anakin_skywalker The general's command ship is dead ahead.
obiwan_kenobi Have you noticed the shields are still up?
anakin_skywalker Sorry, Master.
obiwan_kenobi I have a bad feeling about this.
plo_koon There they are.
obiwan_kenobi R2, locate the chancellor.
anakin_skywalker I sense Count Dooku.
obiwan_kenobi - I sense a trap.
anakin_skywalker - Next move?
obiwan_kenobi Spring the trap.
anakin_skywalker R2, go back.
anakin_skywalker I need you to stay with the ship.
obiwan_kenobi Take this and wait for orders.
general_grievous What's the situation, Captain?
captain_raymus_antilles Two Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
general_grievous Just as Count Dooku predicted.
anakin_skywalker Destroyers.
battle_droid Drop your weapons.
battle_droid I said drop 'em.
droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 - Roger, roger.
obiwan_kenobi - Did you press the stop button?
obiwan_kenobi - No.
anakin_skywalker There's more than one way out of here.
padme We want to get moving.
obiwan_kenobi R2, activate elevator 31174.
obiwan_kenobi - Come in, R2.
super_battle_droid_1#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 - What that?
obiwan_kenobi R2, do you copy?
super_battle_droid_2#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Get back to work.
anakin_skywalker That nothin'.
obiwan_kenobi Activate the elevator 31174.
obiwan_kenobi R2- Always on the move.
obiwan_kenobi R2, switch on the comlink.
anakin_skywalker R2, can you hear me?
obiwan_kenobi Stop.
obiwan_kenobi Stop.
obiwan_kenobi R2, we need to be going up.
droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Hands up, Jedi.
obiwan_kenobi R2, do you copy?
anakin_skywalker R2, do you hear me?
obiwan_kenobi R2, we need to be going up, not down.
super_battle_droid_1#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Hey, you!
obiwan_kenobi That's better.
super_battle_droid_1#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You stupid little astro droid.
obiwan_kenobi Oh, it's you.
anakin_skywalker - What was that all about?
obiwan_kenobi - Did I say anything?
anakin_skywalker - He's trying.
obiwan_kenobi - I didn't say anything.
obiwan_kenobi - Chancellor.
anakin_skywalker - Are you all right?
anakin_skywalker Count Dooku.
obiwan_kenobi - This time we will do it together.
anakin_skywalker - I was about to say that.
senator_palpatine Get help.
senator_palpatine You're no match for him.
senator_palpatine He's a Sith lord.
obiwan_kenobi Chancellor Palpatine, Sith lords are our speciality.
count_dooku Your swords, please.
count_dooku We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the chancellor.
obiwan_kenobi You won't get away this time, Dooku.
naboo_royal_security_guard I've been looking forward to this.
anakin_skywalker My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
count_dooku Good.
count_dooku Twice the pride, double the fall.
count_dooku Get- I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.
obiwan_kenobi You have hate.
obiwan_kenobi You have anger.
anakin_skywalker But you don't use them.
obiwan_kenobi Good, Anakin.
count_dooku Good.
senator_palpatine Kill him.
senator_palpatine Kill him now.
anakin_skywalker I shouldn't.
senator_palpatine Do it.
senator_palpatine You did well, Anakin.
senator_palpatine He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
anakin_skywalker Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
anakin_skywalker I shouldn't have done that.
anakin_skywalker It's not the Jedi way.
senator_palpatine It is only natural.
senator_palpatine He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge.
senator_palpatine It wasn't the frst time, Anakin.
senator_palpatine Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People?
senator_palpatine Now we must leave before more security droids arrive.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, there's no time.
senator_palpatine We must get off this ship before it's too late.
anakin_skywalker - He seems to be all right.
senator_palpatine - Leave him, or we'll never make it.
anakin_skywalker His fate will be the same as ours.
general_grievous Prepare for attack!
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 All batteries, fre!
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Fire!
anakin_skywalker Elevator's not working.
obiwan_kenobi R2, activate elevator 3224.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 - Reverse stabilizers.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 - Reversing stabilizers.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Magnetize!
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Magnetize!
general_grievous Fire the emergency booster engines.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 We're levelling out, sir.
anakin_skywalker Easy.
anakin_skywalker We're in a bit of a situation here.
obiwan_kenobi - Did I miss something?
anakin_skywalker - Hold on.
super_battle_droid_1#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 - What is that?
obiwan_kenobi - Oops.
anakin_skywalker R2, shut down the elevator.
obiwan_kenobi Too late.
obiwan_kenobi Jump!
obiwan_kenobi Let's see if we can fnd something in the hangar bay that's still flyable.
anakin_skywalker R2, get down here.
obiwan_kenobi R2, do you copy?
naboo_royal_security_guard General, we found the Jedi.
naboo_royal_security_guard They're in hallway 328.
general_grievous Activate ray shields.
anakin_skywalker Ray shields.
fang_zar How did this happen?
obiwan_kenobi We're smarter than this.
anakin_skywalker Apparently not.
anakin_skywalker - Patience?
anakin_skywalker Yes.
anakin_skywalker R2 will be along in a few moments and then he'll release the ray shields.
anakin_skywalker See?
anakin_skywalker No problem.
anakin_skywalker Don't move.
obiwan_kenobi Do you have a plan B?
general_grievous Ah, yes.
general_grievous General Kenobi.
naboo_royal_security_guard We've been waiting for you.
anakin_skywalker Excuse me.
general_grievous - That wasn't much of a rescue.
general_grievous And- Anakin Skywalker.
general_grievous I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.
anakin_skywalker General Grievous.
anakin_skywalker You're shorter than I expected.
obiwan_kenobi We have a job to do, Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi Try not to upset him.
general_grievous Your lightsabres will make a fne addition to my collection.
obiwan_kenobi Not this time.
obiwan_kenobi And this time, you won't escape.
general_grievous Crush them!
general_grievous Make them suffer!
obiwan_kenobi Now!
general_grievous Stay at your stations!
general_grievous Don't bother with them.
general_grievous - Keep the ship in orbit.
commander_cody - Yes, sir.
odd_ball#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You lose, General Kenobi.
obiwan_kenobi Get out of here!
general_grievous Time to abandon ship.
anakin_skywalker All the escape pods have been launched.
obiwan_kenobi Grievous.
obiwan_kenobi Can you fly a cruiser like this?
anakin_skywalker - You mean, can I land what's left of it?
obiwan_kenobi - Well?
anakin_skywalker Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.
anakin_skywalker Strap yourselves in.
anakin_skywalker Extend all flaps and drag fns.
obiwan_kenobi We lost something.
anakin_skywalker Not to worry.
obiwan_kenobi We are still flying half a ship.
anakin_skywalker Now we're really picking up speed.
obiwan_kenobi Eight plus 60.
obiwan_kenobi - We're in the atmosphere.
anakin_skywalker - Grab that.
anakin_skywalker Keep us level.
anakin_skywalker Steady.
anakin_skywalker Easy, R2.
obiwan_kenobi Fire ships on the left and the right.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 - We'll take you in.
obiwan_kenobi - Copy that.
obiwan_kenobi - Landing strip, straight ahead.
anakin_skywalker - We're coming in too hot.
obiwan_kenobi Another happy landing.
anakin_skywalker Coming, Master?
obiwan_kenobi No.
obiwan_kenobi I'm not brave enough for politics.
obiwan_kenobi I have to report to the council.
obiwan_kenobi Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
anakin_skywalker Hold on.
anakin_skywalker This whole operation was your idea.
obiwan_kenobi Let us not forget, Anakin, that you rescued me from the buzz droids.
anakin_skywalker All because of your training.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, let's be fair.
obiwan_kenobi Today you were the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
anakin_skywalker All right.
anakin_skywalker But you owe me one, and not for saving your skin for the 10th time.
obiwan_kenobi Ninth time.
obiwan_kenobi That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't count.
obiwan_kenobi I'll see you at the briefng.
obiwan_kenobi Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?
anakin_skywalker Yes.
senator_palpatine Thanks to your two Jedi knights.
senator_palpatine They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.
mace_windu General Grievous will run and hide, as he always does.
mace_windu He's a coward.
mace_windu Then the Jedi Council will make fnding Grievous our highest priority.
anakin_skywalker - Excuse me.
senator_bail_organa - The Republic cannot praise you enough.
anakin_skywalker Thank you, Senator Organa.
c3po It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.
c3po Now there I agree with you.
c3po In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.
anakin_skywalker But the fghting will continue until General Grievous is spare parts.
senator_bail_organa I will do everything I can in the senate.
anakin_skywalker - Excuse me.
senator_bail_organa - Certainly.
anakin_skywalker I've missed you, Padm.
anakin_skywalker I'm all right.
anakin_skywalker It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime.
anakin_skywalker And it might have been, if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.
anakin_skywalker I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the outer rim sieges.
obiwan_kenobi - Wait.
anakin_skywalker - Yes, here.
anakin_skywalker I'm tired of all this deception.
anakin_skywalker I don't care if they know we're married.
padme Anakin, don't say things like that.
anakin_skywalker Are you all right?
anakin_skywalker You're trembling.
anakin_skywalker What's going on?
padme Something wonderful has happened.
padme Ani, I'm pregnant.
anakin_skywalker That's wonderful.
senator_palpatine What are we gonna do?
anakin_skywalker We're not gonna worry about anything right now.
anakin_skywalker All right?
anakin_skywalker This is a happy moment.
anakin_skywalker The happiest moment of my life.
general_grievous Yes, Lord Sidious?
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 General Grievous I suggest you move the separatist leaders to Mustafar.
general_grievous It will be done, my lord.
padme Ani, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo.
padme We can go to the lake country where no one will know where we can be safe.
padme I can go early and fx up the baby's room.
anakin_skywalker You are so beautiful.
padme It's only because I'm so in love.
padme No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
padme So love has blinded you?
anakin_skywalker That's not exactly what I meant.
padme But it's probably true.
anakin_skywalker What's bothering you?
padme Nothing.
anakin_skywalker I remember when I gave this to you.
padme How long is it gonna take for us to be honest with each other?
anakin_skywalker - It was a dream.
padme - Bad?
anakin_skywalker Like the ones I used to have about my mother, just before she died.
padme And?
anakin_skywalker And it was about you.
padme Tell me.
senator_palpatine It was only a dream.
anakin_skywalker You die in childbirth.
padme And the baby?
anakin_skywalker I don't know.
senator_palpatine - It was only a dream.
anakin_skywalker - I won't let this one become real.
padme This baby will change our lives.
anakin_skywalker I know.
padme Do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?
anakin_skywalker We don't need his help.
anakin_skywalker Our baby is a blessing.
yoda Premonitions?
yoda Premonitions.
yoda Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
obiwan_kenobi Someone.
yoda Close to you?
anakin_skywalker Yes.
yoda Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin.
yoda The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
anakin_skywalker I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
yoda Death is a natural part of life.
yoda Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force.
yoda Mourn them, do not.
yoda Miss them, do not.
yoda Attachment leads to jealousy.
yoda The shadow of greed that is.
anakin_skywalker What must I do, Master Yoda?
yoda Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
obiwan_kenobi You've missed the report on the outer rim sieges.
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I'm sorry.
senator_bail_organa I was held up.
anakin_skywalker - I have no excuse.
obiwan_kenobi - In short, they are going very well.
obiwan_kenobi Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
anakin_skywalker What's wrong, then?
obiwan_kenobi The senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the chancellor today.
anakin_skywalker That can only mean less deliberating and more action.
anakin_skywalker Is that bad?
anakin_skywalker It'll make it easier for us to end this war.
obiwan_kenobi Be careful of your friend Palpatine.
anakin_skywalker Be careful of what?
obiwan_kenobi - He has requested your presence.
anakin_skywalker - What for?
obiwan_kenobi He would not say.
anakin_skywalker He didn't inform the council?
anakin_skywalker That's unusual, isn't it?
obiwan_kenobi And it's making me feel uneasy.
senator_palpatine I hope you trust me, Anakin.
anakin_skywalker Of course.
senator_palpatine I need your help, son.
anakin_skywalker What do you mean?
senator_palpatine I'm depending on you.
anakin_skywalker For what?
anakin_skywalker I don't understand.
senator_palpatine To be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic.
senator_palpatine I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
anakin_skywalker Me?
anakin_skywalker A master?
anakin_skywalker But the council elects its own members.
anakin_skywalker They'll never accept this.
senator_palpatine I think they will.
senator_palpatine They need you.
yoda Allow this appointment lightly the council does not.
yoda Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
anakin_skywalker I understand.
mace_windu You are on this council but we do not grant you the rank of master.
anakin_skywalker What?
anakin_skywalker How can you do this?
anakin_skywalker This is outrageous.
anakin_skywalker How can you be on the council and not be a master?
count_dooku Take a seat, young Skywalker.
anakin_skywalker Forgive me, Master.
kiadimundi We have surveyed all systems in the Republic but have found no sign of General Grievous.
yoda Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.
yoda The outlying systems you must sweep.
obiwan_kenobi We do not have many ships to spare.
kiadimundi What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
mace_windu It is critical we send an attack group there immediately.
obiwan_kenobi He's right.
obiwan_kenobi It's a system we cannot afford to lose.
yoda Go I will.
yoda Good relations with the Wookiees I have.
mace_windu It's settled then.
mace_windu Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.
mace_windu May the Force be with us all.
anakin_skywalker Put me on the council and not make me a master?
anakin_skywalker It's never been done in the history of the Jedi.
super_battle_droid_2#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 It's insulting.
obiwan_kenobi Calm down, Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi You have been given a great honour.
obiwan_kenobi To be on the council at your age- it's never happened before.
obiwan_kenobi The fact of the matter is you are too close to the chancellor.
obiwan_kenobi The council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
anakin_skywalker I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the council.
obiwan_kenobi But it's what you wanted.
obiwan_kenobi Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
anakin_skywalker That has nothing to do with this.
obiwan_kenobi The only reason the council has approved your appointment is because the chancellor trusts you.
padme And?
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, I am on your side.
obiwan_kenobi I didn't want to put you in this situation.
super_battle_droid_1#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 What situation?
obiwan_kenobi The council wants you to report on all the chancellor's dealings.
obiwan_kenobi They want to know what he's up to.
anakin_skywalker They want me to spy on the chancellor?
anakin_skywalker - But that's treason.
obiwan_kenobi - We are at war, Anakin.
anakin_skywalker Why didn't the council give me this assignment when we were in session?
obiwan_kenobi This assignment is not to be on record.
anakin_skywalker The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.
anakin_skywalker He befriended me.
anakin_skywalker He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
obiwan_kenobi That is why you must help us.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in offce long after his term has expired.
anakin_skywalker The senate demanded that he stay longer.
obiwan_kenobi Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi Something is out of place.
anakin_skywalker You're asking me to do something against the Jedi code.
anakin_skywalker Against the Republic.
anakin_skywalker Against a mentor and a friend.
anakin_skywalker That's what's out of place here.
padme Why are you asking this of me?
obiwan_kenobi The council is asking you.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin did not take to his new assignment with much enthusiasm.
mace_windu It's very dangerous, putting them together.
mace_windu I don't think the boy can handle it.
obiwan_kenobi I don't trust him.
obiwan_kenobi With all due respect, Master, is he not the chosen one?
obiwan_kenobi Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
mace_windu So the prophecy says.
yoda A prophecy that misread could have been.
obiwan_kenobi He will not let me down.
obiwan_kenobi He never has.
yoda I hope right you are.
anakin_skywalker Sometimes I wonder what's happening to the Jedi order.
anakin_skywalker I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
padme Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
anakin_skywalker What do you mean?
padme What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists and the Republic has become the very evil we've been fghting to destroy?
obiwan_kenobi I don't believe that.
senator_bail_organa And you're sounding like a separatist.
padme This war represents a failure to listen.
padme Now you're closer to the chancellor than anyone.
padme Please, ask him to stop the fghting and let diplomacy resume.
anakin_skywalker Don't ask me to do that.
anakin_skywalker Make a motion in the senate, where that kind of a request belongs.
anakin_skywalker - What is it?
padme - Nothing.
anakin_skywalker Don't do this.
padme Don't shut me out.
padme Let me help you.
anakin_skywalker Hold me.
padme Like you did by the lake on Naboo.
padme So long ago, when there was nothing but our love.
padme No politics, no plotting, no war.
anakin_skywalker - You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
padme - Yes, Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi Come closer.
senator_palpatine I have good news.
senator_palpatine Our clone intelligence units have discovered the location of General Grievous.
senator_palpatine He's hiding in the Utapau system.
anakin_skywalker We'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.
senator_palpatine I would worry about the collective wisdom of the council if it didn't select you for this assignment.
senator_palpatine You're the best choice, by far.
senator_palpatine You know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council.
senator_palpatine If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.
anakin_skywalker I'm not sure I understand.
senator_palpatine You must sense what I have come to suspect.
senator_palpatine The Jedi Council want control of the Republic.
clone_trooper They're planning to betray me.
obiwan_kenobi Search your feelings.
senator_palpatine You know, don't you?
anakin_skywalker I know they don't trust you.
senator_palpatine Or the senate.
anakin_skywalker Or the Republic.
senator_palpatine Or democracy, for that matter.
anakin_skywalker I have to admit, my trust in them has been shaken.
senator_palpatine Why?
senator_palpatine They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?
senator_palpatine They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?
anakin_skywalker I don't know what to say.
senator_palpatine Remember back to your early teachings.
senator_palpatine All who gain power are afraid to lose it.
senator_palpatine - Even the Jedi.
anakin_skywalker - The Jedi use their power for good.
senator_palpatine Good is a point of view, Anakin.
senator_palpatine The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way including their quest for greater power.
anakin_skywalker The Sith rely on their passion for their strength.
anakin_skywalker They think inwards- only about themselves.
senator_palpatine And the Jedi don't?
anakin_skywalker The Jedi are selfless.
anakin_skywalker They only care about others.
senator_palpatine Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
senator_palpatine I thought not.
senator_palpatine It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.
senator_palpatine It's a Sith legend.
senator_palpatine He had such a knowledge of the dark side he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
anakin_skywalker He could actually save people from death?
senator_palpatine The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
anakin_skywalker What happened to him?
senator_palpatine Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew.
senator_palpatine He could save others from death but not himself.
anakin_skywalker Is it possible to learn this power?
senator_palpatine Not from a Jedi.
kiadimundi Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau?
anakin_skywalker A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the chairman of Utapau.
yoda Act on this we must.
yoda The capture of General Grievous will end this war.
yoda Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
anakin_skywalker The chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
mace_windu The council will make up its own mind who is to go not the chancellor.
yoda A master is needed, with more experience.
kiadimundi I concur.
mace_windu Master Kenobi should go.
anakin_skywalker I agree.
capt_typho Very well.
mace_windu Council adjourned.
clone_trooper The droids have started up their main power generators.
yoda - Then now the time is, Commander.
commander_cody - Yes, sir.
anakin_skywalker - You're gonna need me on this one.
anakin_skywalker - I agree.
obiwan_kenobi However, it may turn out Just to be a wild bantha chase.
anakin_skywalker Master.
anakin_skywalker I've disappointed you.
anakin_skywalker I haven't been very appreciative of your training.
anakin_skywalker I've been arrogant, and I apologize.
anakin_skywalker I've just been so frustrated with the council.
obiwan_kenobi You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you.
senator_palpatine I have trained you since you were a small boy.
obiwan_kenobi I have taught you everything I know.
obiwan_kenobi And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be.
obiwan_kenobi But be patient, Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi It will not be long before the council makes you a Jedi master.
padme Obi-Wan.
mace_windu May the Force be with you.
obiwan_kenobi Goodbye, old friend.
mace_windu May the Force be with you.
commander_cody Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here.
commander_cody On the far side.
obiwan_kenobi I'll keep them distracted until you get there.
obiwan_kenobi - Just don't take too long.
obiwan_kenobi - Come on.
commander_cody When have I ever let you down?
capt_typho Very well.
obiwan_kenobi The burden is on me not to destroy all the droids until you arrive.
obiwan_kenobi Save your energy.
obiwan_kenobi I can't.
battle_droid Don't give up, Padm.
anakin_skywalker Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?
padme He came by this morning.
padme What did he want?
obiwan_kenobi He's worried about you.
padme He says you've been under a lot of stress.
anakin_skywalker I feel lost.
anakin_skywalker Lost?
anakin_skywalker What do you mean?
anakin_skywalker Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.
obiwan_kenobi They trust you with their lives.
anakin_skywalker Something's happening.
anakin_skywalker I'm not the Jedi I should be.
anakin_skywalker I want more.
anakin_skywalker And I know I shouldn't.
padme You expect too much of yourself.
anakin_skywalker - I found a way to save you.
padme - Save me?
anakin_skywalker From my nightmares.
padme Is that what's bothering you?
anakin_skywalker I won't lose you, Padm.
anakin_skywalker I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.
padme - I promise you.
padme - No, I promise you.
tion_medon Greetings, young Jedi.
tion_medon What brings you to our remote sanctuary?
obiwan_kenobi Unfortunately, the war.
tion_medon There's no war here- unless you brought it with you.
obiwan_kenobi With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.
tion_medon He is here.
tion_medon We are being held hostage.
tion_medon - They are watching us.
anakin_skywalker - I understand.
tion_medon Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.
obiwan_kenobi Tell your people to take shelter.
obiwan_kenobi If you have warriors, now is the time.
obiwan_kenobi Take the fghter back to the ship.
obiwan_kenobi Tell Cody I've made contact.
tion_medon - He didn't say.
obiwan_kenobi It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here.
general_grievous I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the outer rim.
general_grievous - You will be safe there.
nute_gunray - Safe?
obiwan_kenobi Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General.
nute_gunray Without Count Dooku, I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.
general_grievous Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip.
general_grievous Your ship is waiting.
tion_medon Hello there.
general_grievous General Kenobi.
padme You are a bold one.
senator_palpatine Kill him.
general_grievous Back away.
general_grievous I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
obiwan_kenobi Your move.
general_grievous You fool.
general_grievous I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku.
general_grievous Attack, Kenobi.
general_grievous Army or not you must realize you are doomed.
anakin_skywalker I don't think so.
commander_cody Master Windu, may I interrupt?
commander_cody General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous and we have begun our attack.
padme Thank you, Commander.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor.
mace_windu His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
mace_windu I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.
anakin_skywalker The dark side of the Force surrounds the chancellor.
kiadimundi If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous then he should be removed from office.
mace_windu The Jedi Council would have to take control of the senate in order to secure a peaceful transition.
yoda To a dark place this line of thought will carry us.
yoda Great care we must take.
obiwan_kenobi Chancellor.
anakin_skywalker We've just received a report from Master Kenobi.
anakin_skywalker He has engaged General Grievous.
senator_palpatine We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
anakin_skywalker I should be there with him.
senator_palpatine It's upsetting to me to see that the council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents.
obiwan_kenobi Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi master?
mace_windu I wish I knew.
anakin_skywalker More and more I get the feeling that I'm being excluded from the council.
anakin_skywalker I know there are things about the Force that they're not telling me.
senator_palpatine They don't trust you, Anakin.
senator_palpatine They see your future.
senator_palpatine They know your power will be too strong to control.
senator_palpatine You must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you.
senator_palpatine Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
senator_palpatine How do you know the ways of the Force?
senator_palpatine My mentor taught me everything about the Force.
senator_palpatine Even the nature of the dark side.
commander_cody You know the dark side?
senator_palpatine If one is to understand the great mystery one must study all its aspects not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi.
senator_palpatine If you wish to become a complete and wise leader you must embrace a larger view of the Force.
senator_palpatine Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.
senator_palpatine Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi.
senator_palpatine Learn to know the dark side of the Force and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
anakin_skywalker What did you say?
senator_palpatine Use my knowledge.
obiwan_kenobi I beg you.
obiwan_kenobi You're the Sith lord.
padme I know what's been troubling you.
obiwan_kenobi Listen to me.
senator_palpatine Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council.
senator_palpatine Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.
senator_palpatine A life of signifcance of conscience.
anakin_skywalker - Are you going to kill me?
anakin_skywalker - I would certainly like to.
senator_palpatine I know you would.
senator_palpatine I can feel your anger.
senator_palpatine It gives you focus makes you stronger.
senator_palpatine I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
anakin_skywalker Of course.
general_grievous You should.
senator_palpatine But you're not sure of their intentions, are you?
anakin_skywalker I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
obiwan_kenobi You have great wisdom, Anakin.
senator_palpatine Know the power of the dark side.
senator_palpatine Power to save Padm.
obiwan_kenobi So uncivilized.
anakin_skywalker Master Windu, I must talk to you.
mace_windu Skywalker, we just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.
mace_windu We're on our way to make sure the chancellor returns emergency power back to the senate.
obiwan_kenobi He won't give up his power.
anakin_skywalker I've just learned a terrible truth.
anakin_skywalker I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord.
mace_windu A Sith lord?
anakin_skywalker Yes.
anakin_skywalker The one we've been looking for.
anakin_skywalker - How do you know this?
anakin_skywalker - He knows the ways of the Force.
senator_palpatine He's been trained to use the dark side.
mace_windu - Are you sure?
anakin_skywalker - Absolutely.
mace_windu Then our worst fears have been realized.
mace_windu We must move quickly if the Jedi order is to survive.
anakin_skywalker Master, the chancellor is very powerful.
anakin_skywalker You'll need my help if you're going to arrest him.
mace_windu For you own good, stay out of this affair.
count_dooku I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker.
mace_windu There is much fear that clouds your judgement.
anakin_skywalker - I must go, Master.
obiwan_kenobi - No.
mace_windu If what you've told me is true, you will have gained my trust.
mace_windu Wait in the council chambers until we return.
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
senator_palpatine You do know, don't you if theJedi destroy me any chance of saving her will be lost.
mace_windu Master Windu.
senator_palpatine I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then.
senator_palpatine I must say you're here sooner than expected.
mace_windu In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic you're under arrest, Chancellor.
anakin_skywalker Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
mace_windu The senate will decide your fate.
senator_palpatine - I am the senate.
mace_windu - Not yet.
anakin_skywalker It's treason then.
mace_windu You are under arrest, my lord.
senator_palpatine Anakin, I told you it would come to this.
obiwan_kenobi I was right.
anakin_skywalker The Jedi are taking over.
mace_windu The oppression of the Sith will never return.
obiwan_kenobi You have lost.
senator_palpatine You will die!
anakin_skywalker He's a traitor!
tion_medon He is the traitor!
senator_palpatine I have the power to save the one you love.
senator_palpatine You must choose.
obiwan_kenobi Don't listen to him, Anakin!
senator_palpatine Don't let him kill me.
senator_palpatine I can't hold it any longer.
obiwan_kenobi I can't.
senator_palpatine I'm weak.
senator_palpatine I'm too weak.
padme Help me.
padme Help me!
senator_palpatine I can't hold on any longer.
mace_windu I am going to end this once and for all.
padme You can't.
anakin_skywalker He must stand trial.
mace_windu He has control of the senate and the courts.
senator_palpatine He's too dangerous to be left alive.
senator_palpatine I'm too weak.
anakin_skywalker - Don't kill me.
senator_palpatine Please.
anakin_skywalker - It's not the Jedi way.
anakin_skywalker He must live.
senator_palpatine - Please don't.
anakin_skywalker - I need him.
senator_palpatine Please don't!
senator_palpatine Power!
senator_palpatine Unlimited power!
anakin_skywalker What have I done?
senator_palpatine You're fulflling your destiny, Anakin.
senator_palpatine Become my apprentice.
anakin_skywalker Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
wrangler#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I will do whatever you ask.
count_dooku Good.
obiwan_kenobi Just help me save Padm's life.
padme I can't live without her.
senator_palpatine To cheat death is a power only one has achieved but if we work together I know we can discover the secret.
anakin_skywalker I pledge myself to your teachings.
count_dooku Good.
count_dooku Good.
senator_palpatine The Force is strong with you.
senator_palpatine A powerful Sith you will become.
senator_palpatine Henceforth you shall be known as Darth Vader.
padme Thank you, my master.
senator_palpatine Because the council did not trust you, my young apprentice I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot.
senator_palpatine When the Jedi learn what has transpired here they will kill us, along with all the senators.
anakin_skywalker I agree.
anakin_skywalker The council's next move will be against the senate.
senator_palpatine Every single Jedi including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi is now an enemy of the Republic.
padme I understand, Master.
senator_palpatine We must move quickly.
anakin_skywalker The Jedi are relentless.
senator_palpatine If they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end.
senator_palpatine First I want you to go to the Jedi temple.
senator_palpatine We will catch them off-balance.
senator_palpatine Do what must be done, Lord Vader.
senator_palpatine Do not hesitate.
padme Show no mercy.
senator_palpatine Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padm.
anakin_skywalker What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?
senator_palpatine Their betrayal will be dealt with.
senator_palpatine After you have killed all the Jedi in the temple go to the Mustafar system.
senator_palpatine Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other separatist leaders.
senator_palpatine Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!
yoda Hurry!
obiwan_kenobi Come on.
obiwan_kenobi Let's go!
obiwan_kenobi Commander, contact your troops.
obiwan_kenobi Tell them to move to the higher levels.
commander_cody Very good, sir.
commander_cody By the way, I think you'll be needing this.
padme Thank you, Cody.
obiwan_kenobi Let's get a move on.
obiwan_kenobi We've got a battle to win.
commander_cody Yes, sir.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Commander Cody the time has come.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Execute order 66.
motee Yes, my lord.
commander_cody Blast him!
obiwan_kenobi Come on!
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Execute order 66.
general_grievous It will be done, my lord.
general_grievous It will be done, my lord.
odd_ball#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Master Skywalker, there are too many of them.
senator_palpatine What are we going to do?
c3po The chancellor's offce indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.
anakin_skywalker Don't worry.
anakin_skywalker I'm sure he'll be all right.
anakin_skywalker - What's going on here?
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 - There's been a rebellion, sir.
anakin_skywalker Don't worry.
battle_droid The situation is under control.
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I'm sorry, sir.
obiwan_kenobi It's time for you to leave.
senator_bail_organa And so it is.
anakin_skywalker Don't worry about him.
obiwan_kenobi Let him go.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 All these Wookiees are dead.
anakin_skywalker Move to the east.
commander_cody Yes, sir.
senator_bail_organa Hopefully we'll be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Did you fnd Kenobi?
clone_trooper Sir, no one could have survived that fall.
CLONE#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Start loading your men on the ships.
obiwan_kenobi Emergency code 913.
obiwan_kenobi I have no contact on any frequency.
mace_windu Master Kenobi.
obiwan_kenobi - Repeat.
mace_windu - Master Kenobi.
padme Senator Organa.
obiwan_kenobi My clone troops turned on me.
obiwan_kenobi I need help.
anakin_skywalker We havejust rescued Master Yoda.
senator_bail_organa It appears this ambush has happened everywhere.
senator_bail_organa We're sending you our coordinates.
c3po Hush!
c3po Not so loud.
anakin_skywalker Are you all right?
padme I heard there was an attack on the Jedi temple.
padme - You could see the smoke from here.
anakin_skywalker - I'm fne.
anakin_skywalker I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
anakin_skywalker What's happening?
senator_palpatine The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic.
obiwan_kenobi I can't believe that.
anakin_skywalker I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the chancellor myself.
senator_palpatine What are you gonna do?
anakin_skywalker I will not betray the Republic.
anakin_skywalker My loyalties lie with the chancellor and with the senate and with you.
padme - What about Obi-Wan?
anakin_skywalker - I don't know.
anakin_skywalker Many Jedi have been killed.
senator_palpatine We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the chancellor.
padme Anakin, I'm afraid.
anakin_skywalker Have faith, my love.
anakin_skywalker Everything will soon be set right.
anakin_skywalker The chancellor has given me a very important mission.
anakin_skywalker The separatists have gathered on the Mustafar system.
anakin_skywalker I'm going there to end this war.
anakin_skywalker Wait for me until I return.
anakin_skywalker Things will be different.
padme I promise.
obiwan_kenobi Please, wait for me.
padme Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2.
c3po Take care, my little friend.
c3po Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?
padme No, thank you, 3PO.
c3po I feel so helpless.
obiwan_kenobi How many other Jedi have managed to survive?
yoda Heard from no one have we.
senator_bail_organa I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi temple.
senator_bail_organa That's why I went looking for Yoda.
obiwan_kenobi Have we had any contact from the temple?
yoda Received a coded retreat message we have.
senator_bail_organa It requests all Jedi to return to the temple.
senator_bail_organa - It says the war is over.
obiwan_kenobi - Then we must go back.
obiwan_kenobi If there are any stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.
yoda Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
obiwan_kenobi There is too much at stake.
anakin_skywalker I agree.
yoda And a little more knowledge might light our way.
nute_gunray The plan has gone as you had promised, my lord.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You have done well, Viceroy.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives he will take care of you.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 We're receiving a message from the chancellor's offce, sir.
senator_bail_organa - Send it through.
commander_cody - Yes, sir.
mas_amedda Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor requests your presence at a special session of Congress.
general_grievous - I will be there.
mas_amedda - He'll be expecting you.
senator_bail_organa - Could be a trap.
anakin_skywalker - I don't think so.
obiwan_kenobi The chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the senate intact.
yoda If a special session of Congress there is easier for us to enter the Jedi temple it will be.
anakin_skywalker R2, stay with the ship.
nute_gunray Welcome, Lord Vader.
naboo_royal_security_guard We've been expecting you.
senator_palpatine And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.
super_battle_droid_1#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 What's happened?
padme The chancellor's been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.
senator_palpatine The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated.
obiwan_kenobi Not even the younglings survived.
yoda Killed not by clones this Padawan.
yoda By a lightsabre he was.
anakin_skywalker Who?
obiwan_kenobi Who could have done this?
obiwan_kenobi Stop!
senator_palpatine In order to ensure the security and continuing stability the Republic will be reorganized into the frst Galactic Empire!
senator_palpatine The war is over.
nute_gunray Lord Sidious promised us peace.
obiwan_kenobi We only want- I have recalibrated the code, warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.
yoda For the clones to discover the recalibration a long time it will take.
obiwan_kenobi Wait.
anakin_skywalker Master.
obiwan_kenobi There is something I must know.
yoda If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you fnd.
anakin_skywalker I must know the truth, Master.
obiwan_kenobi It can't be.
obiwan_kenobi It can't be.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You have done well, my new apprentice.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Now, Lord Vader go and bring peace to the Empire.
senator_palpatine I can't watch any more.
yoda Destroy the Sith we must.
obiwan_kenobi Send me to kill the emperor.
padme I will not kill Anakin.
yoda To fght this Lord Sidious, strong enough you are not.
obiwan_kenobi He is like my brother.
anakin_skywalker I cannot do it.
yoda Twisted by the dark side young Skywalker has become.
yoda The boy you trained, gone he is.
senator_palpatine Consumed by Darth Vader.
obiwan_kenobi I do not know where the emperor has sent him.
anakin_skywalker I don't know where to look.
yoda Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and fnd him you will.
obiwan_kenobi When was the last time you saw him?
padme - Yesterday.
mace_windu - And do you know where he is now?
obiwan_kenobi Padm, I need your help.
obiwan_kenobi - He is in grave danger.
padme - From the Sith?
obiwan_kenobi From himself.
senator_palpatine Anakin has turned to the dark side.
anakin_skywalker You're wrong.
padme How could you even say that?
obiwan_kenobi I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.
padme Not Anakin.
padme He couldn't.
obiwan_kenobi He was deceived by a lie.
obiwan_kenobi We all were.
obiwan_kenobi It appears that the chancellor is behind everything, including the war.
obiwan_kenobi Palpatine is the Sith lord we've been looking for.
obiwan_kenobi After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.
obiwan_kenobi I don't believe you.
obiwan_kenobi I can't.
senator_palpatine I must fnd him.
padme You're going to kill him, aren't you?
obiwan_kenobi He has become a very great threat.
obiwan_kenobi I can't.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin is the father, isn't he?
anakin_skywalker I'm so sorry.
capt_typho - Milady, let me come with you.
padme - There's no danger.
senator_palpatine The fghting's over.
padme And this is personal.
obiwan_kenobi I'll be all right, Captain.
obiwan_kenobi This is something I must do myself.
padme Besides, 3PO will look after me.
obiwan_kenobi Oh, dear.
obiwan_kenobi Do you know?
c3po I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.
anakin_skywalker The separatists have been taken care of, my master.
mace_windu It is fnished then.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 All droid units must shut down immediately.
commander_cody Very good, my lord.
anakin_skywalker I saw your ship.
senator_palpatine - What are you doing out here?
obiwan_kenobi - I was so worried about you.
padme Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
anakin_skywalker What things?
yoda He said you've turned to the dark side.
padme That you killed younglings.
anakin_skywalker Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
anakin_skywalker He cares about us.
anakin_skywalker Us?
anakin_skywalker He knows.
padme He wants to help you.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, all I want is your love.
anakin_skywalker Love won't save you, Padm.
anakin_skywalker - Only my new powers can do that.
padme - At what cost?
padme You're a good person.
anakin_skywalker Don't do this.
anakin_skywalker I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.
anakin_skywalker I am becoming more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.
anakin_skywalker And I'm doing it for you.
anakin_skywalker To protect you.
obiwan_kenobi Come away with me.
padme Help me raise our child.
padme Leave everything else behind while we still can.
droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Don't you see?
anakin_skywalker We don't have to run away any more.
anakin_skywalker I have brought peace to the Republic.
anakin_skywalker I am more powerful than the chancellor.
padme I don't believe what I'm hearing.
senator_palpatine Obi-Wan was right.
padme You've changed.
anakin_skywalker I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan.
anakin_skywalker The Jedi turned against me.
padme Don't you turn against me.
anakin_skywalker I don't know you any more.
padme You're breaking my heart.
anakin_skywalker Because of Obi-Wan?
padme Because of what you've done.
senator_palpatine What you plan to do.
obiwan_kenobi Stop.
obiwan_kenobi Stop now.
obiwan_kenobi Come back.
padme - I love you.
anakin_skywalker - Liar!
senator_palpatine You're with him!
anakin_skywalker You brought him here to kill me.
obiwan_kenobi Let her go, Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi Let her go.
anakin_skywalker You turned her against me!
padme You have done that yourself.
general_grievous You will not take her from me!
obiwan_kenobi Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.
obiwan_kenobi You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
anakin_skywalker Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.
anakin_skywalker I see through the lies of the Jedi.
anakin_skywalker I do not fear the dark side as you do.
anakin_skywalker I have brought peace freedom, justice and security to my new empire.
obiwan_kenobi Your new empire?
padme Don't make me kill you.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!
anakin_skywalker If you're not with me then you're my enemy.
obiwan_kenobi Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
anakin_skywalker I will do what I must.
senator_palpatine You will try.
yoda I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.
yoda Or should I call you Darth Sidious?
mace_windu Master Yoda.
yoda Surprised?
obiwan_kenobi Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda.
senator_palpatine Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I have waited a long time for this moment my little green friend.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 At last the Jedi are no more.
yoda Not if anything to say about it I have.
yoda At an end your rule is.
yoda If so powerful you are why leave?
anakin_skywalker You will not stop me.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.
anakin_skywalker As is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
yoda Hurry.
yoda Careful timing we will need.
senator_bail_organa Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.
clone_trooper There's no sign of his body, sir.
mas_amedda - Then he is not dead.
senator_palpatine - Double your search.
commander_cody Yes, sir.
clone_trooper Right away, sir.
senator_palpatine Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate take-off.
anakin_skywalker - Yes, Master.
senator_palpatine - I sense Lord Vader is in danger.
yoda Into exile I must go.
yoda Failed I have.
obiwan_kenobi I have failed you, Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi I have failed you.
anakin_skywalker I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over.
anakin_skywalker Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!
anakin_skywalker From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
mace_windu Then you are lost!
anakin_skywalker This is the end for you, my master.
obiwan_kenobi It's over, Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi I have the high ground.
anakin_skywalker You underestimate my power.
anakin_skywalker Don't try it.
obiwan_kenobi You were the chosen one!
obiwan_kenobi It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them!
obiwan_kenobi Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!
padme I hate you!
obiwan_kenobi You were my brother, Anakin.
padme I loved you.
mace_windu Master Kenobi.
c3po We have Miss Padm on board.
anakin_skywalker Yes.
senator_palpatine Please, please hurry.
c3po We should leave this dreadful place.
anakin_skywalker Is Anakin all right?
plo_koon There he is.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 He's still alive.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Get a medical capsule immediately.
commander_cody Yes, sir.
clone_trooper Right away.
anakin_skywalker Excuse me, Master Yoda.
senator_bail_organa Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.
senator_bail_organa We'll take her to the medical centre.
yoda Quickly.
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Medically, she's completely healthy.
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.
obiwan_kenobi - She's dying?
anakin_skywalker - We don't know why.
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 She has lost the will to live.
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.
senator_bail_organa Babies?
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 She's carrying twins.
padme Luke.
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 - It's a girl.
padme - Leia.
padme There's good in him.
anakin_skywalker I know.
anakin_skywalker Can you hear me?
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
darth_vader Where is Padm?
anakin_skywalker Is she all right?
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 It seems, in your anger, you killed her.
obiwan_kenobi I?
anakin_skywalker I couldn't have.
darth_vader She was alive.

quigon_jinn Captain.
captain#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Yes, sir?
quigon_jinn Tell them we wish to board at once.
captain#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 With all due respect, the Ambassadors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Yes, yes, of course... as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to receive the Ambassador.
tc14 I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.
tc14 We are greatly honored by your visit Ambassadors. Make yourselves comfortable. My master will be with you shortly.
obiwan_kenobi I have a bad feeling about this.
quigon_jinn I don't sense anything.
obiwan_kenobi It's not about the mission, Master, it's something... elsewhere... elusive.
quigon_jinn Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now where it belongs.
obiwan_kenobi But Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...
quigon_jinn ... but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan.
obiwan_kenobi Yes, Master.
obiwan_kenobi How do you think the trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands?
quigon_jinn These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 What?!? What did you say?
tc14 The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.
daultay_dofine I knew it! They're here to force a settlement.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Distract them. I will contact Lord Sidious.
daultay_dofine Are you brain dead? I'm not going in there with two Jedi! Send the droid.
obiwan_kenobi Is it in their nature to make us wait this long?
quigon_jinn No... I sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute.
the_emperor What is it?
daultay_dofine ... This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious. The blockade is finished! We dare not go against these Jedi.
the_emperor Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slim in my sight again.
the_emperor This turn of events is unfortunate. We must accelerate our plans. Begin landing your troops.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 My Lord, is that... legal?
the_emperor I will make it legal?
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 And the... Jedi?
the_emperor The Chancellor should have never brought them into this. Kill them, immediately.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Yes... yes, My Lord. As you wish.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Captain?! Look!!
tc14 ... Sorry.
quigon_jinn Dioxin!
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 They must be dead by now. Destroy, what's left of them.
tc14 Oh, excuse me.
owo-1#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Check it out Corporal. We'll cover you.
battle_droid Roger, roger.
owo-1#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Uh-oh, blast them...
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 What is going on down there?
tey_how#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 We've lost the transmission, sir.
rune_haako Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Well, no, but I don't... Seal off the bridge.
tey_how#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Yes sir.
rune_haako That won't be enough, sir.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 I want droidekas up here at once!!!
rune_haako We will not survive this.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Close the blast doors!!!
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 That will hold them.
rune_haako ... They're still coming through!
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 This is impossible!!
rune_haako Where are those droidekas?!
obiwan_kenobi Master, destroyers.
obiwan_kenobi They have shield generators.
quigon_jinn It's a standoff! Let's go!
rune_haako ... They're no match for droidekas.
tey_how#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.
quigon_jinn Battle droids.
obiwan_kenobi It's an invisible army.
quigon_jinn This is an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.
obiwan_kenobi You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were short.
tey_how#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Sir, a transmission from the planet.
rune_haako It's Queen Amidala herself.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 At last we're getting results.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Again you come before me, Your highness.
padme You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy ... Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 I was not aware of such a failure.
padme I'm aware the Chancellor's Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have been commanded to reach a settlement.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 I know nothing of any Ambassadors ... you must be mistaken.
padme Beware, Viceroy....the Federation has gone too far this time.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 We would never do anything without the approval of the Senate. You assume too much.
padme We will see.
rune_haako She's right, the Senate will never....
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 It's too late now.
rune_haako Do you think she suspects an attack?
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there.
the_emperor ...The negotiations haven't started because the Ambassadors aren't there? How could that be true? I have assurances from the Chancellor... his Ambassadors did arrive. It must be the... get... negotiate...
padme Senator Palpatine?!? What's happening?
captain_panaka Check the transmission generators...
sio_bibble A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.
padme The Federation would not dare go that far.
captain_panaka The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be finished.
padme We must continue to rely on negotiation.
sio_bibble Negotiation? We've lost all communications! ... and where are the Chancellors Ambassadors?
captain_panaka This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.
padme I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.
oom-9#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Yes, Viceroy?
rune_haako Captain, we've searched the ship and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have got on onto one of your landing craft.
oom-9#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 If they are down here, sir, we'll find them.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Use caution. These Jedi are not to be underestimated.
jar_jar_binks Oh, noooooooooo!
quigon_jinn Quick! Get out of here!
quigon_jinn Get off!
jar_jar_binks Whas dat?
jar_jar_binks Hey wait!

quigon_jinn That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them.
boss_nass Wesa no like da Naboo! Da Naboo tink day so smarty. Day tink day brains so big.
obiwan_kenobi Once those droids take control of the surface, they will take control of you.
boss_nass Mesa no tink so. Dey not know of uss-en.
obiwan_kenobi You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to one of you will affect the other. You must understand this.
quigon_jinn Then speed us on our way.
quigon_jinn We could use a transport.
quigon_jinn Thank you for your help. We leave in peace.
obiwan_kenobi Master, what's a bongo?
quigon_jinn A transport, I hope.
jar_jar_binks Daza setten yousa up. Goen through da planet core is bad bombin!! Ahhh... any hep hair would be hot.
obiwan_kenobi Master, we're short of time.
quigon_jinn We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. This Gungan my be of help.
quigon_jinn What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?
quigon_jinn I have saved his life. He owes me what you call a "life.debt."
quigon_jinn Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.
jar_jar_binks Ah-huh.

quigon_jinn There's always a bigger fish.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.
the_emperor I have the Senate bogged down in procedures. They will have no choice but to accept your control of the system.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.
the_emperor Queen Amidala is young and naive. You will find controlling her will not be difficult.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Yes, My Lord.
rune_haako You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi?
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 No need to report that to him, until we have something to report.
jar_jar_binks Where wesa goin.
quigon_jinn Don't worry, the Force will guide us...
jar_jar_binks Ooooh, maxibig..."da Force"...Well, dat smells stinkowiff.
obiwan_kenobi ... we're losing power.
jar_jar_binks Oh, no...
quigon_jinn Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
jar_jar_binks What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINKEN WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!?
obiwan_kenobi Power's back.
quigon_jinn Relax.
obiwan_kenobi You overdid it.
quigon_jinn Head for that outcropping.
jar_jar_binks Oie Boie!
oom-9#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Viceroy, we have captured the queen.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Ah, victory!
jar_jar_binks Oo. Dis seem uverly.
sio_bibble ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 The Queen and I will sign a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here. I assurances it will be ratified by the Senate.
padme I will not co-operate.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Now, now, your Highness. In time, the suffering of your people will persuade you to see our point of view. Commander?
oom-9#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Yes, sir!
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Process them.
oom-9#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Captain, take them to Camp Four.
captain#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Roger, roger.
quigon_jinn We should leave the streets, your highness.
captain_panaka Get their weapons.
jar_jar_binks Woah. Yousa guys bombad!
quigon_jinn We're the Ambassadors, for the Supreme Chancellor.
sio_bibble Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.
quigon_jinn The negotiations never took place. It's urgent that we make contact with the republic.
captain_panaka They've knocked out all our communications.
quigon_jinn Do you have transports?
captain_panaka In the main hanger. This way.
captain_panaka There are too many of them.
quigon_jinn That won't be a problem. Your Highness, under the circumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.
padme Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.
quigon_jinn They will kill you if you stay.
sio_bibble They wouldn't dare.
captain_panaka They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of theirs legal. They can't afford to kill her.
quigon_jinn There is something else behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.
sio_bibble Our only hope is for the Senate to side with us ... Senator Palpatine will need your help.
padme Either choice presents great danger.
padme ... to us all.
padme We are brave, Your Highness.
quigon_jinn If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.
padme Then, I will plead our case to the Senate. Be careful, Governor.
captain_panaka We need to free those pilots.
obiwan_kenobi I'll deal with that.
gonk_droid Halt?
quigon_jinn I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking these people to Coruscant.
gonk_droid Where are you taking them?
quigon_jinn To Coruscant.
gonk_droid Coruscant!? Ahh, that doesn't compute. ... Ahh, wait! ... Ahh, you're under arrest!
obiwan_kenobi Go!
obiwan_kenobi Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.
jar_jar_binks Ello, boyos.
ric_olie There's the blockade.
ric_olie The shield generator's been hit.
jar_jar_binks How wude!
obiwan_kenobi We're loosing droids... fast.
captain_panaka If we can't get the shield generators fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.
ric_olie The shields are gone.
ric_olie Powers back! That little droid did it... bypassed the main power drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.
ric_olie There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant... the hyperdrive is leaking.
quigon_jinn We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.
obiwan_kenobi Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The Trade Federation has no presence there.
captain_panaka How can you be sure?
quigon_jinn It's controlled by the Hutts...
captain_panaka You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are gangsters ... If they discovered her ...
quigon_jinn ... It would be no different than if we landed on a system controlled by the Federation ... except the Hutts aren't looking for her, which gives us an advantage.
the_emperor ... And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo cruiser got pat the blockade.
the_emperor I want that treaty signed.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 My Lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range.
the_emperor ...not for a Sith...
the_emperor ... This is my apprentice. Darth Maul. He will find your lost ship.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 This is getting out of hand ... now there are two of them.
rune_haako We should not have made this bargain.
captain_panaka ...An extremely well put together little droid. Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.
padme It is to be commended...what is its number?
captain_panaka R2-D2, Your Highness.
padme Thank you, Artoo Detoo... Padme!
padme Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves our gratitude... Continue, Captain.
quigon_jinn Your Highness, with your permission we're heading for a remote planet called Tatooine. It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation.
captain_panaka I do not agree with the Jedi on this.
quigon_jinn You must trust my judgment, Your Highness.
jar_jar_binks Hidoe!
jar_jar_binks Sorry. Whosa are yousa?
padme I'm Padme.
jar_jar_binks Mesa Ja Ja Binksss...
padme You're a GUNGAN, aren't you?
jar_jar_binks Ah-huh.
padme How did you end up here with us?
jar_jar_binks My no know... mesa day starten pitty okeyday witda brisky morning munchen. Den boom.... getten berry skeered, un grabbed dat Jedi, and before mesa knowen it... pow! Mesa here. ... getten berry berry skeered.
obiwan_kenobi That's it. Tatooine... There's a settlement.
quigon_jinn Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract any attention.
obiwan_kenobi The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
quigon_jinn That'll complicate things. Be wary... I sense a disturbance in the Force.
obiwan_kenobi I feel it also, Master.
quigon_jinn Don't let them send ant transmissions.
jar_jar_binks Dis sun doen murder ta mesa skin.
captain_panaka Wait!
captain_panaka Wait. Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you.
quigon_jinn No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport is not going to be pleasant...
captain_panaka The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet.
quigon_jinn This is not a good idea. Stay close to me.
quigon_jinn ...moisture farms for the most part. Some indigenous tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one are havens for those who do not wish to be found...
padme ... like us.
jar_jar_binks Dissen berry berry bad. Ooooh... icky... icky... goo.
quigon_jinn We'll try one of the smaller dealers.
quigon_jinn I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
watto Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. Peedenk! Naba dee unko
quigon_jinn My droid here has a readout of what I need.
aquigon_jinn Don't touch anything.
anakin_skywalker Are you an angel?
padme What?
anakin_skywalker An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They are the most beautiful creatures in the universe. They live on the Moons of Iego I think.
padme You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much.
anakin_skywalker I listen to all the traders and starpilots that come by here. I'm a pilot, you know, and some day I'm gonna fly away from this place.
padme You're a pilot?
anakin_skywalker All my life.
padme How long have you been here?
anakin_skywalker Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces.
padme You're ... a slave?
anakin_skywalker I am a person! My name is Anakin.
padme I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. This is a strange place to me.
anakin_skywalker Hey...
jar_jar_binks Wha?
anakin_skywalker Hit the nose!
jar_jar_binks Oh!
watto ... a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the only one hereabouts who has one... but thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think... Saying of which, how's thee going to pay for all this?
quigon_jinn I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
watto Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real...
quigon_jinn I don't have anything else. But credits will do fine.
watto No they won'ta.
quigon_jinn Credits will do fine.
watto No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that.
anakin_skywalker ... wouldn't have lasted long if I weren't so good at fixing things.
quigon_jinn We're leaving. Jar Jar?
padme I'm glad to have met you.
anakin_skywalker I was glad to meet you too.
quigon_jinn ... and you're sure there's nothing left on board?
obiwan_kenobi A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe. But not enough for you to barter with. Not in the amounts you're talking about.
quigon_jinn All right. I'm sure another solution will present itself. I'll check back later.
quigon_jinn Not likely. We have nothing of value, that's our problem.
jar_jar_binks Ooops.
jar_jar_binks Who, mesa?
anakin_skywalker Hi!
quigon_jinn Hi there.
anakin_skywalker Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.
jar_jar_binks Mesa haten crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.
quigon_jinn Nevertheless, the boy is right ... you were heading for trouble... Thanks, my young friend.
jar_jar_binks But... but... mesa doen nutteen!
obiwan_kenobi This storm will slow them down.
captain_panaka It looks pretty bad.
captain_panaka Panaka?
ric_olie We're receiving a message from home.
captain_panaka We'll be right there.
anakin_skywalker Here, you'll like these pallies... Here.
quigon_jinn Thank you.
jira Oh, my bones are aching ... storm's coming up, Annie. You'd better get home quick.
anakin_skywalker Do you have shelter?
quigon_jinn We'll head back to our ship.
anakin_skywalker Is it far?
padme It's on the outskirts.
anakin_skywalker You'll never reach the outskirts in time... sandstorms are very, very dangerous. Come on! I'll take you to my place.
anakin_skywalker Mom! Mom! I'm home.
jar_jar_binks Dissen cozy.
anakin_skywalker These are my friends, Mom.
jar_jar_binks Hidoe!
quigon_jinn I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
anakin_skywalker I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
quigon_jinn Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.
anakin_skywalker Come on! I'll show you Threepio!
anakin_skywalker Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet.
padme He's wonderful!
anakin_skywalker You really like him? He's a protocol droid ... to help Mom. Watch!
c3po Oh, oh. Where is everybody?
c3po Oh, hello, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How might I serve you?
padme He's perfect.
c3po Oh, perfect.
anakin_skywalker When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer.
anakin_skywalker I'm building a Podracer!
c3po I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable. Oh, hello. I don't believe we've been introduced.
c3po Artoo-Detoo. A pleasure to meet you. I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations.
c3po I beg your pardon .... what do you mean, naked?
c3po My parts are showing? My goodness.
sio_bibble ... the death toll is catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes... you must contact me ...
obiwan_kenobi It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind.
quigon_jinn It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.
obiwan_kenobi What if it is true and the people are dying?
quigon_jinn Either way, we're running out of time.
darth_maul Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master.
the_emperor Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no difficulty in taking the Queen to Naboo to sign the treaty.
darth_maul At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.
the_emperor You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will be no match for you.
shmi_skywalker All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.
anakin_skywalker I've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine.
shmi_skywalker Any attempt to escape...
anakin_skywalker ... and they blow you up ... boom!
jar_jar_binks How wude.
padme I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's anti-slavery laws...
shmi_skywalker The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.
jar_jar_binks 'Scuse me.
anakin_skywalker Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?
quigon_jinn They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.
anakin_skywalker I'm the only human who can do it.
quigon_jinn You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.
quigon_jinn Don't do that again.
anakin_skywalker You're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
quigon_jinn What makes you think that?
anakin_skywalker I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.
quigon_jinn Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.
anakin_skywalker I don't think so ... No one can kill a Jedi.
quigon_jinn I wish that were so...
anakin_skywalker I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here to free all the slaves... have you come to free us?
quigon_jinn No, I'm afraid not ...
anakin_skywalker I think you have ... why else would you be here?
quigon_jinn I can see there's no fooling you ... We're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission.
anakin_skywalker How did you end up here in the outer rim?
padme Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.
anakin_skywalker I can help! I can fix anything!
quigon_jinn I believe you can, but first we must acquire the parts we need...
jar_jar_binks Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
padme These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
shmi_skywalker Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.
quigon_jinn Podracing ... Greed can be a powerful ally.
anakin_skywalker I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod.
shmi_skywalker Anakin! Watto won't let you...
anakin_skywalker Watto doesn't know I've built it. You could make him think it's yours, and get him to let me pilot it for you.
shmi_skywalker I don't want you to race. It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.
anakin_skywalker But Mom, I love it. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.
shmi_skywalker Anakin!
quigon_jinn Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who might help us?
anakin_skywalker Mom... you said the biggest problem in the universe is nobody helps each other...
padme I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We'll find some other way...
shmi_skywalker No, there is no other way... I may not like it, but... he can help you... he was meant to help you.
padme Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know. The Queen will not approve.
quigon_jinn The Queen does not need to know.
padme Well, I don't approve.
watto The boy tells me you wanta sponser him in a race. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think, huh.
quigon_jinn My ship will be the entry fee.
watto Oh, not bad... not bad... ah Nubian, ah.
quigon_jinn It's in good order, except for the parts I need.
watto ... what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last race. It will take some time to fix it.
anakin_skywalker Ahhhh ... it wasn't my fault really... Sebulba flashed me with his vents. I actually saved the Pod... mostly.
watto That you did huh. The boy is good, no doubts there huh.
quigon_jinn Well, I have acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest ever built."
watto I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings fifty-fifty, I think.
quigon_jinn If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need... If we lose, you keep my ship.
quigon_jinn Either way, you win.
watto Deal!
obiwan_kenobi What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for a long time.
quigon_jinn Well, it's too dangerous to call for help now. A ship without a power supply isn't gonna get us anywhere, and... there is something about this boy...
quigon_jinn You should be proud of your son. He gives without any thought of reward.
shmi_skywalker Well he knows nothing of greed. He has a...
quigon_jinn He has special powers.
shmi_skywalker Yes...
quigon_jinn He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.
shmi_skywalker He deserves better than a slave's life.
quigon_jinn Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early. The Force is unusually strong with him, that much is clear. Who is his father?
shmi_skywalker There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him, I can't explain what happened.
shmi_skywalker Can you help him?
quigon_jinn I don't know. I didn't actually come here to free slaves.
kitser#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Wow, a real Astro Droid... how'd you get so lucky?
anakin_skywalker This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race tomorrow!
kitser#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 What? With this??
wald#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Ona joka, Annie.
amee#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 You've been working on that thing for years.
little_girl#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 It's never gonna run.
seek Come on, let's go and play ball. Keep racing, Ani, you're gonna be bug squash.
anakin_skywalker Hey! Jar Jar! Keep away from those energy binders... If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.
jar_jar_binks Ouch muy tonge is fat. Muy togne. Oucho.
jar_jar_binks Hey! Ou-oh. Ow, hey, I'm stuck.
c3po You know, I find that Jar Jar creature very... odd.
kitser#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 You don't even know if this things gonna run.
anakin_skywalker It will.
quigon_jinn I guess it's time we found out. Here use this power charge.
quigon_jinn Come on Kitster. Lets move away.
jar_jar_binks Mm... my mout. I'm stuck. Hep I'm s..
jar_jar_binks Muy tonge is fat...
c3po You're quite right. He's very odd indeed.
jar_jar_binks Ow, th... thank yous.
anakin_skywalker It's working! It's working!
quigon_jinn Stay still, Annie. Let me clean this cut.
anakin_skywalker There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets?
quigon_jinn Most of them.
anakin_skywalker Has anyone been to them all?
quigon_jinn Not likely.
anakin_skywalker I want to be the first one to see them all ...
shmi_skywalker Annie, bedtime!
anakin_skywalker ... Ouch!
quigon_jinn There we are, good as new...
shmi_skywalker Ani! I'm not going to tell you again!
anakin_skywalker What are you doing?
quigon_jinn Checking your blood for infections.
quigon_jinn You have a big day tomorrow. Goodnight.
quigon_jinn Obi-Wan...
obiwan_kenobi Yes, Master.
quigon_jinn I need an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.
obiwan_kenobi Wait a minute...
quigon_jinn I need a midi-chlorian count.
obiwan_kenobi The reading's off the chart... over twenty thousand. Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!
quigon_jinn No Jedi has.
obiwan_kenobi What does that mean?
quigon_jinn I'm not sure.
watto ... I wanta see your spaceship the moment the race is over.
quigon_jinn Patience, my good friend. You'll have your winnings before the suns set, and we'll be far away from here.
watto Not if your ship belongs to me, I think... I warn you, no funny business.
quigon_jinn You don't think Anakin will win?
watto Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.
jar_jar_binks Oh-no!
quigon_jinn Why do you think that?
watto He always wins. I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.
quigon_jinn I'll take that bet.
watto You'll what??!!
quigon_jinn I'll wager my new racing pod against... say... the boy and his mother.
watto No Pod's worth two slaves ... not by a long shot.
quigon_jinn The boy, then ...
watto We'll let fate decide, huh. I just happen to have a chance cube here. Blue it's the boy, red his mother...
watto You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won't win the race, so ... it makes little difference.
anakin_skywalker What'd he mean by that?
quigon_jinn I'll tell you later. Goodmorning.
c3po Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous.
c3po I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships!
kitser#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 This is so wizard Ani! I'm sure you'll do it this time.
padme Do what?
kitser#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Finish the race, of course!
padme You've never won a race?
anakin_skywalker Well... not exactly...
padme Not even finished?!
anakin_skywalker ... Kitster's right, I will this time.
quigon_jinn Of course you will.
beed That's absolutly right. And a big turnout here, from all corners of the Outer Rim territories. I see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid.
beed I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund system.
beed Two time winner, Boles Roor ...
beed And a late entry, Anakin Skywalker, a local boy.
beed I see the flaggers are moving onto the track.
quigon_jinn You all set, Ani?
anakin_skywalker Yep.
quigon_jinn All right.
quigon_jinn Remember, concentrate on the moment. Feel. Don't think. Use your instincts.
anakin_skywalker I will.
quigon_jinn May the Force be with you.
shmi_skywalker Is he nervous?
quigon_jinn He's fine.
padme You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen is not...
quigon_jinn The Queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden. You should too.
padme You assume too much.
beed Start your engines.
beed Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.
beed Well it looks like Quadrinaros is having engine trouble also.
jar_jar_binks C'mon Ani!
beed And there goes Skywalker...
jar_jar_binks Go Ani, go!
beed He'll be hard pressed to catch up with the leaders.
beed Looks like a few Tusken Riaders have camped out on the canyon dune turn.
beed Ooo! There goes Quadrinaros power cuppling.
ody#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Droids!
c3po Where is master Anakin?
padme Look, here he comes!
beed It looks like Skywalker is moving up in the field...
c3po He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear!
beed Oh, I don't care what universe you're from, that's gotta hurt.
jar_jar_binks Here he comes, yahoo!
beed At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely followed by Skywalker...
beed Skywalker's been forced onto the service ramp!
beed It's Skywalker!
beed Amazing... a quick controlled thrust and he's back on course!
jar_jar_binks Did he crashed?
beed Skywalker's in trouble. Sebulba takes the lead.
beed He's catching Sebulba.
jar_jar_binks Careful, Ani, careful, Ani!
beed That little human being is out of his mind.
beed They're side by side!
c3po I can't believe it.
beed The crowds are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah
anakin_skywalker Mom! I did it! Yeah!
jar_jar_binks Great job, Ani!
padme We owe you everything, Ani.
shmi_skywalker It's so wonderful, Ani. You have brought hope to those who have none. I'm so very proud of you...
anakin_skywalker Ah...
watto You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to win! Somehow you knew it! I lost everything.
quigon_jinn Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you'll lose. Bring the parts to the main hanger. I'll come by your shop later so you can release the boy.
watto You can't have him! It wasn't a fair bet!
quigon_jinn Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts ... I'm sure they can settle this.
watto Take him!
quigon_jinn Well, we have all the essential parts we need. I'm going back...some unfinished business. I won't be long.
obiwan_kenobi Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life form...?
quigon_jinn It's the boy who's responsible for getting those parts. Get this hyperdrive generator installed.
obiwan_kenobi Yes, Master. It shouldn't take long.
quigon_jinn Hi!
anakin_skywalker Yes!
anakin_skywalker Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have!
shmi_skywalker Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful Ani.
quigon_jinn And Anakin has been freed.
anakin_skywalker What?!?
quigon_jinn You're no longer a slave.
anakin_skywalker Did you hear that?
shmi_skywalker Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?
quigon_jinn Yes. Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.
anakin_skywalker You mean I get to come with you in your starship?!
quigon_jinn Anakin, training to become a Jedi is not be a easy challenge. And if you succeed, it's a hard life.
anakin_skywalker But I want to go. It's what I've always dreamed of doing. Can I go, Mom?!
shmi_skywalker Anakin, this path has been placed for you; the choice is yours alone.
anakin_skywalker I want to do it.
quigon_jinn Then, pack your things. We haven't much time.
anakin_skywalker Yipee!!
anakin_skywalker What about Mom? Is she free too?
quigon_jinn I tried to free your mother, Ani, but Watto wouldn't have it.
anakin_skywalker You're coming, aren't you, Mom?
shmi_skywalker Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let go...
anakin_skywalker I don't want things to change.
shmi_skywalker But you can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from setting. Now... hurry.
shmi_skywalker Thank you.
quigon_jinn I'll watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right?
c3po Oh! Oh my, oh. Hello Master Anakin.
anakin_skywalker Well, Threepio, I'm free ... and I'm going away ... in a starship ...
c3po Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I wish you well. However, I should prefer it if I were a little more... comepleted.
anakin_skywalker I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio ... give you coverings and all ... I'm going to miss working on you. You've been a great pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything.
c3po Sell me?!?
anakin_skywalker Bye.
anakin_skywalker I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.
shmi_skywalker Annie...
anakin_skywalker Will I ever see you again?
shmi_skywalker What does your heart tell you?
anakin_skywalker I hope so... yes... I guess.
shmi_skywalker Then we will see each other again.
anakin_skywalker I will come back and free you, Mom... I promise.
shmi_skywalker Now be brave, and don't look back... don't look back.
anakin_skywalker Qui-Gon, sir, wait, I'm tired!
quigon_jinn Anakin, drop!
quigon_jinn Annie, tell them to take off!
captain_panaka Qui-Gon's in trouble!
obiwan_kenobi Take off. Over there! Fly low!
anakin_skywalker Are you all right?
quigon_jinn I think so.
obiwan_kenobi What was it?
quigon_jinn I'm not sure... but he was well trained in the Jedi arts. My guess is he was after the Queen...
anakin_skywalker What are we going to do about it?
quigon_jinn We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.
anakin_skywalker Hi. You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Your Queen is lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.
sio_bibble This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people have decided...
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Take him away.
oom-9#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these rumored underwater villages... they will not stay hidden for long.
padme Are you all right?
anakin_skywalker It's very cold.
padme You come from a warm planet, Annie. A little too warm for my taste. Space is cold.
anakin_skywalker You seem sad.
padme The Queen is... worried. Her people are suffering... dying. She must convince the Senate to intervene, I'm not sure what will happen.
anakin_skywalker I made this for you. So you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will bring you good fortune.
padme It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you by. Many things will change when we reach the capital, Ani. My caring for you will remain.
anakin_skywalker I care for you too. Only I...
padme ...Miss your mother.
ric_olie Coruscant... the entire planet is one big city. There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle. And look over there, Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.
the_emperor It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. With the communications breakdown, we've become very concerned. I'm anxious to hear your report on the situation. May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
chancellor_valorum Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honor to finally meet you in person.
padme Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.
chancellor_valorum I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant situation. I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your position.
padme I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor.
the_emperor There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can overcome it...
quigon_jinn I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately. The situation has become more complicated.
the_emperor ...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates. There is no interest in the common good. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.
padme Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.
the_emperor If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real power... he is mired by baseless accusations of corruption. The bureaucrats are in charge now.
padme What options have we?
the_emperor Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.
padme He has been our strongest supporter?
the_emperor Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts...
padme The courts take even longer to decide things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator... We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.
the_emperor To be realistic, Your Majesty, I think we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.
padme That is something I cannot do.
quigon_jinn ... He was trained in the Jedi arts. My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord.
kiadimundi Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium.
mace_windu I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing.
yoda Ah, hard to see, the dark side is.
mace_windu We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you.
yoda Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
quigon_jinn With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a vergence in the Force.
yoda A vergence, you say?
mace_windu Located around a person?
quigon_jinn A boy... his cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians I have ever seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.
mace_windu You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring balance to the Force... you believe it's this boy??
quigon_jinn I don't presume...
yoda But you do! Revealed your opinion is.
quigon_jinn I request the boy be tested, Master.
yoda Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
quigon_jinn Finding him was the will of the Force... I have no doubt of that.
mace_windu Bring him before us, then.
guard#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 The boy is here to see Padme.
rabe Let him in.
rabe I'm sorry, Ani, but Padme is not here right now.
padme Who is it?
rabe Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness.
padme I've sent Padme on an errand.
anakin_skywalker I'm on my way to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.
anakin_skywalker I may not see her again... so... I came to say goodbye.
padme We will tell her for you. We are sure her heart goes with you.
anakin_skywalker Thank you, Your Highness.
chancellor_valorum The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.
the_emperor Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has occurred which started with the taxation of trade routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppression of the Trade Federation.
lott_dod This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!
chancellor_valorum The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade Federation at this time. Please return to your station.
the_emperor To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, recently elected ruler of Naboo, who speaks on our behalf.
padme Honorable representatives of the Republic, I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of the Trade...
lott_dod I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth.
aks_moe The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commission must be appointed.
chancellor_valorum The point...
the_emperor Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will dissapear.
chancellor_valorum The point is conceded ... will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?
padme I will not defer... I have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed... I move for a "vote of no confidence"... in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
assembly#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!
mas_amedda Order!
the_emperor Now they will elect a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...
obiwan_kenobi The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master. He's too old.
quigon_jinn Anakin will become a Jedi ... I promise you.
obiwan_kenobi Do not defy the Council, Master... not again.
quigon_jinn I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.
obiwan_kenobi If you would just follow the code you would be on the council. They will not go along with you this time.
quigon_jinn You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.
anakin_skywalker A ship... a cup... a ship... a speeder.
yoda Hmm... how feel you?
anakin_skywalker Cold, sir.
yoda Afraid are you?
anakin_skywalker No, sir.
yoda See through you, we can.
mace_windu Be mindful of your feelings...
kiadimundi Your thoughts dwell on your mother.
anakin_skywalker I miss her.
yoda Afraid to lose her... I think, hmm?
anakin_skywalker What's that got to do with anything?
yoda Everything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering... I sense much fear in you.
jar_jar_binks Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?
padme I don't know.
jar_jar_binks Gungans get pasted too, eh?
padme I hope not.
jar_jar_binks Gungans no die'n without a fight... wesa warriors. Wesa gotta grand army. Dat why yousa no liken us, mesatinks.
captain_panaka Your Highness? Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been nominated to succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.
the_emperor A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. Your Majesty, if I am elected, I promise put an end to corruption.
padme Who else can be nominated?
captain_panaka Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ailee Teem of Malastare.
the_emperor I feel confident ... our "situation" will create a strong sympathy vote for us ... I will be Chancellor.
padme I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator, there will be nothing left of our our people, our way of life...
the_emperor I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet.
padme Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I've decided to go back to Naboo.
the_emperor Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! They'll force you to sign the treaty.
padme I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from that of our people. Captain!
captain_panaka Your Highness?
padme Ready my ship!
captain_panaka Please, Your Majesty, stay here... where it's safe.
padme It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the Senate.
kiadimundi The Force is strong with him.
quigon_jinn He's to be trained, then?
mace_windu No. He will not be trained.
mace_windu He is too old.
quigon_jinn He is the chosen one... you must see it.
yoda Clouded, this boy's future is.
quigon_jinn I will train him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.
yoda An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
mace_windu The code forbids it.
quigon_jinn Obi-Wan is ready...
obiwan_kenobi I am ready to face the trials.
yoda Our own council we will keep on who is ready.
quigon_jinn He is headstrong and he has much to learn of the living Force, but he is capable. There is little more he can learn from me.
yoda Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
mace_windu Now is not the time for this... the Senate is voting for a new Supreme Chancellor and Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.
kiadimundi And draw out the Queen's attacker.
mace_windu Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.
yoda May the Force be with you.
obiwan_kenobi It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth.
quigon_jinn From your point of view....
obiwan_kenobi The boy is dangerous... they all sense it. Why can't you?
quigon_jinn His fate is uncertain, he's not dangerous. The Council will decide Anakin's future... that should be enough for you. Now get on board!
anakin_skywalker Master Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem.
quigon_jinn You won't be, Ani... I'm not allowed to train you, so I want you to watch me and be mindful...
quigon_jinn ... always remember, your focus determines your reality. Stay close to me and you will be safe.
anakin_skywalker Master, sir... I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians. I've been wondering, what are midi-chlorians?
quigon_jinn Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all living cells.
anakin_skywalker They live inside of me?
quigon_jinn In your cells, yes... and we are symbionts with them.
anakin_skywalker Symbionts?
quigon_jinn Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the Force. They continually speak to us, telling us the will of the Force. When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to you.
anakin_skywalker I don't understand.
quigon_jinn With time and training, Ani... you will... you will.
quigon_jinn Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you.
padme I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the Federation means to destroy me.
quigon_jinn I assure you, I will not let that happen.
jar_jar_binks Wesa goen home!
anakin_skywalker C'mon, Artoo.
the_emperor Is the planet secure?
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 We have taken over the last pockets of primitive life forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.
the_emperor Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as they are. I'm sending my apprentice, Darth Maul, to join you.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Yes, my Lord.
rune_haako A Sith Lord here?!!
ric_olie Those are the forward stabalizers.
anakin_skywalker And those two control the pitch?
ric_olie You catch on pretty quick.
captain_panaka As soon as we land the Federation will arrest you, and force you to sign the treaty.
quigon_jinn I agree... I'm not sure what you wish to accomplish by this.
padme I will take back what's ours.
captain_panaka There are too few of us, Your Highness.... we have no army.
quigon_jinn And I can only protect you. I cannot fight a war for you.
padme Jar Jar Binks!
jar_jar_binks Mesa, Your Highness?
padme Yes. I need your help.
ric_olie I have one battleship on my scope.
obiwan_kenobi It's a droid control ship.
captain_panaka They've probably spotted us.
obiwan_kenobi We haven't much time.
obiwan_kenobi Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.
quigon_jinn Good.
obiwan_kenobi Do you think the Queen's idea will work?
quigon_jinn The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot use our power to help her.
obiwan_kenobi I'm... I'm sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to disagree with you about the boy... and I am grateful you think I am ready to take the trials.
quigon_jinn You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan, and you're a much wiser man than I am. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight.
jar_jar_binks Dare-sa nobody dare. Da Gungan city is diserted. Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.
obiwan_kenobi Do you think they have been taken to camps?
captain_panaka More likely they were wiped out.
jar_jar_binks Mesa no tink so.
quigon_jinn Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?
jar_jar_binks When in trouble, Gungans go to sacred place. Mesa show you. C'mon, mesa show you.
captain_tarpals You Honor, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.
jar_jar_binks Ah, ello dare, ye big Boss Nass, You Honor.
boss_nass Jar Jar Binks, who's da uss-en others??
padme I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo... I come before you in peace.
boss_nass Ah, Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks... Yousa all bombad.
padme We have searched you out 'cause we wish to form an alliance...
padme Your Honor...
boss_nass Whosa dis?
padme I am Queen Amidala.
padme This is my decoy... my protection... my loyal bodyguard.
padme ... I am sorry for my deception, but it was necessary to protect myself. Although we do not always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in peace. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build. If we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever... I ask you to help us... ... no, I beg you to help us. We are your humble servants...
padme ... Our fate is in your hands.
boss_nass Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis.
boss_nass Maybe wesa bein friends.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 ... we've sent out patrols. We've already located their starship in the swamp... It won't be long, My Lord.
the_emperor This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggressive... Lord Maul, be mindful. Let them make the first move.
darth_maul Yes, my Master.
gungan_guard Daza comen!
anakin_skywalker All right...
anakin_skywalker ... They're here.
padme Good, they made it.
jar_jar_binks Oh, no, no, no...
jar_jar_binks General??! Oh, no..
padme What is the situation?
captain_panaka Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards have formed an underground resistance movement. I brought back as many of the leaders as I could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.
padme The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the Droid Army away from the cities. Artoo, we can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Panaka will create a diversion. Then we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy. Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.
padme What do you think, Master Jedi?
quigon_jinn The Viceroy will be well guarded.
captain_panaka The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem.
quigon_jinn There is a possibility, with this diversion many, Gungans will be killed.
padme We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship orbiting the planet.
quigon_jinn A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields.
obiwan_kenobi And there's an even bigger danger. If the Viceroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid army.
padme Well that is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything depends on it.
the_emperor ... she is more foolish than I thought.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 We are sending more troops to meet this army assembling in the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives.
the_emperor This will work to our advantage.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.
the_emperor Wipe them out... all of them.
general_ceel#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Halt! Starten up the shield.
quigon_jinn Once we get inside, you find a safe place to hide and stay there.
anakin_skywalker Sure.
quigon_jinn Stay there!
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 I thought the battle was going to take place far from here... this is too close!
quigon_jinn Ani, find cover, quick!
padme Get to your ships!
ric_olie Fighters straight ahead.
fighter_pilot_bravo_2 Roger, Brovo Leader.
fighter_pilot_bravo_3 Roger, Brovo Leader.
oom-9#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Cease fire!
jar_jar_binks Steady, steady.
rune_haako Activate the droids.
tey_how#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Yes, sir!
captain_tarpals Ouch time.
captain_tarpals Fire!
padme My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.
captain_panaka Red Group, Blue Group, everybody, this way.
anakin_skywalker Hey! Wait for me.
quigon_jinn Anakin, stay where you are. You'll be safe there.
anakin_skywalker But, I...
quigon_jinn Stay in that cockpit.
quigon_jinn We'll handle this...
padme We'll take the long way.
anakin_skywalker We've gotta do something, Artoo!
anakin_skywalker I'm trying to. I don't know where the trigger is.
anakin_skywalker Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one....
anakin_skywalker No. Wait, here it is.
padme Let's go!
anakin_skywalker Ah... It's on automatic pilot.
anakin_skywalker Try and override it.
padme We don't have time for this, Captain.
anakin_skywalker Look! There they are! That's where the autopilot is taking us.
ric_olie Their deflector shield is too strong.
anakin_skywalker This is tense!
anakin_skywalker Artoo, get us off this Autopilot! It's gonna get us both killed!
anakin_skywalker You did it, Artoo!
anakin_skywalker Okay, let's go left!
anakin_skywalker Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and that's what I'm gonna do.
anakin_skywalker I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.
anakin_skywalker I know we're in trouble! Just hang on!
captain_panaka Go!
jar_jar_binks Dis is nuttsen.
jar_jar_binks O, oh.
jar_jar_binks Hey, hey! Gimme a lift.
captain_tarpals Ja Ja! Usen da booba!
jar_jar_binks Wat! Mesa no have a booba.
captain_tarpals Here, taken dis one.
captain_tarpals Ja Ja! Jump Ja Ja! Jump!
padme Throw down your weapons. They win this round.
anakin_skywalker We're hit Artoo! Wah...!
anakin_skywalker I'm tring to stop. I'm tring to stop.
anakin_skywalker Everything's overheated.
anakin_skywalker Oops! This is not good.
obiwan_kenobi Noooo!
general_ceel#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 No given up General Ja Ja. Wesa tink of sometin.
jar_jar_binks My giv up. My giv up.
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you to sign the treaty... and end this pointless debate in the Senate.
sabe Viceroy, your occupation here has ended!
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 After her! This one is a decoy!
captain_panaka Jam the doors!
padme Now, Viceroy, we will discuss a new treaty.
anakin_skywalker Yes! We have power. Shields up.
anakin_skywalker Take this!...
anakin_skywalker ... and this!
anakin_skywalker Woa!
anakin_skywalker Oops.
tey_how#unknown#StarWars.Episode01 Sir, we're losing power... There seems to be a problem with the main reactor...
daultay_dofine Impossible!! Nothing can get through our shield.
anakin_skywalker Let's get out of here.
fighter_pilot_bravo_2 What's that?? It's blowing up from the inside.
ric_olie We didn't hit it.
anakin_skywalker Now, this is Podracing!
fighter_pilot_bravo_3 Look! One of ours! Outta the main hold!!
anakin_skywalker Whoo, hoo!
jar_jar_binks Whatsen dey doin?
captain_tarpals The control ship has been destroyed. Look!
jar_jar_binks Dey all broken.
quigon_jinn It is too late... It's...
obiwan_kenobi No!
quigon_jinn Obi-Wan promise ... promise me you'll train the boy...
obiwan_kenobi Yes, Master...
quigon_jinn He is the chosen one... he will... bring balance... train him!
padme Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate and explain all this.
captain_panaka I think you can kiss your Trade franchise goodbye.
the_emperor We are indebted to you for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi. And you, young Skywalker, we will watch your career with great interest.
padme Congratulations on your election, Chancellor.
the_emperor Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty. It is you who should be congratulated. Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic.
yoda Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Council does. But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.
obiwan_kenobi Qui-Gon believed in him.
yoda The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.
obiwan_kenobi Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without the approval of the Council if I must.
yoda Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree with you, the council does. Your apprentice, Skywalker will be.
anakin_skywalker What will happen to me now?
obiwan_kenobi The Council has granted me permission to train you. You will be a Jedi, I promise.
mace_windu There's no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith.
yoda Always two there are.... no more... no less. A master and an apprentice.
mace_windu But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?
boss_nass Peace!

lieutenant#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Senator, we’re making our final approach into Coruscant.
the_emperor Very good, Lieutenant.
captain_typho We made it. I guess I was wrong. There was no danger at all.
padme Cordé!
corde My lady… So sorry… I’ve failed you Senator…
padme No…
captain_typho My lady, we’re still in danger here.
padme I shouldn’t have come back.
captain_typho This vote is very important. You do your duty; Cordé did hers, now come.
captain_typho Senator Amidala, Please.
the_emperor I don’t know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.
mace_windu If they do break away-
the_emperor I will not let this republic that has stood for a thousand years be split in two. My negotiations will not fail.
mace_windu If they do, you must realize that there aren’t enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We’re Keepers of the Peace, not soldiers.
the_emperor Master Yoda- do you think it will really come to war?
yoda The Dark Side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is.
hologram_alien#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 The Loyalist Committee has arrived, your Honor.
the_emperor Good. Send them in.
the_emperor We will discuss this matter later.
yoda Senator Amidala… Your tragedy on the landing platform… terrible. Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart.
padme Do you have any idea who’s behind this attack?
mace_windu Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of Naboo.
padme I think Count Dooku is behind it.
kiadimundi He’s a political idealist, not a murderer.
mace_windu You know, milady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He couldn’t assassinate anyone: it’s not in his character.
yoda But, for certain Senator, in grave danger you are.
the_emperor Master Jedi… may I suggest the senator be placed under the protection of your graces.
senator_bail_organa Do you really think that’s a wise decision under these stressful times?
padme Chancellor, if I may comment I do not believe-
the_emperor …the situation is that serious. No, but I do, Senator. I realize all too well that additional security may be disruptive for you. But, perhaps, someone you’re familiar with. An old friend, like… Master Kenobi.
mace_windu That’s possible. He’s just returned from a border dispute on Ansion.
the_emperor Do it for me, milady, please. The thought of losing you… is unbearable.
mace_windu I’ll have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, milady.
padme Thank you, Master Windu.
obiwan_kenobi You seem a little on edge.
anakin_skywalker Not at all.
obiwan_kenobi I haven’t felt you this tense since… since we fell into that nest of gundarks.
anakin_skywalker You fell into that nightmare, Master, and I rescued you. Remember?
obiwan_kenobi Oh… yes. You’re sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath.
anakin_skywalker I haven’t seen her in ten years, master.
jar_jar_binks Obi? Obi! Mesa so smilin’ to seein’ yousa.
obiwan_kenobi Good to see you again, Jar-Jar.
jar_jar_binks Senator Padmé! Mesa palos here. Lookie, lookie, Senator. Desa Jedi arriven.
obiwan_kenobi It’s a great pleasure to see you again milady.
padme It has been far too long Master Kenobi. Ani? My goodness, you’ve grown.
anakin_skywalker So have you. Grown more beautiful, I mean. Well, for- for a senator, I mean.
padme Ani, you’ll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.
obiwan_kenobi Our presence here will be invisible, milady, I can assure you.
captain_typho I’m Captain Typho of Her Majesty’s security service. Queen Jamilla has been informed of your assignment. I am grateful you’re here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit to.
padme I don’t need more security, I need answers. I want to know who’s trying to kill me.
obiwan_kenobi We’re here to protect you, Senator, not to start an investigation.
anakin_skywalker We will find out who’s trying to kill you, Padmé. I promise you.
obiwan_kenobi We will not exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.
anakin_skywalker I meant that in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.
obiwan_kenobi We will not go through this exercise again, Anakin, and you will pay attention to my lead.
anakin_skywalker Why?
obiwan_kenobi What?
anakin_skywalker Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi. It’s overkill, Master; investigation is applies in our mandate.
obiwan_kenobi We will do exactly as the Council has instructed… and you will learn your place, young one.
padme Perhaps with merely your presence, the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I will retire.
captain_typho I know I’ll feel better with you here. I’ll have an officer stationed at every floor, and I’ll be in the control center downstairs.
jar_jar_binks Mesa bustin’ with happiness seein’ yousa again, Ani.
anakin_skywalker She hardly even recognized me, Jar-Jar. I’ve thought about her every day since we parted. She’s forgotten me completely.
jar_jar_binks Shesa happy. Happier than mesa seein’ her in a longo time.
obiwan_kenobi You’re focusing on the negative, Anakin, be mindful of your thoughts. She was pleased to see us. Now, let’s check the security.
zam_wesell I hit the ship but they used a decoy.
bounty_hunter#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 We’ll have to try something more subtle this time, Zam. My client is getting impatient. Here- take these.
bounty_hunter#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Be careful- they’re very poisonous. Zam- there can be no mistakes this time.
obiwan_kenobi Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin would try that way. Any activity up here?
anakin_skywalker Quiet as a tomb. I don’t like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
obiwan_kenobi What’s going on?
anakin_skywalker She covered the cameras. I don’t think she liked me watching her.
obiwan_kenobi What is she thinking?
anakin_skywalker She programmed Artoo to warn us if there is an intruder.
obiwan_kenobi There are many other ways to kill a senator.
anakin_skywalker I know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don’t we, Master?
obiwan_kenobi You’re using her as bait.
anakin_skywalker It was her idea. Don’t worry: no harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.
obiwan_kenobi It’s too risky. Besides, your senses aren’t that attuned my young apprentice.
anakin_skywalker And yours are?
obiwan_kenobi Possibly.
obiwan_kenobi You look tired.
anakin_skywalker I don’t sleep well anymore.
obiwan_kenobi Because of your mother?
anakin_skywalker I don’t know why I keep dreaming about her.
obiwan_kenobi Dreams pass, in time.
anakin_skywalker I’d much rather dream about Padmé. Just being around her is… intoxicating.
obiwan_kenobi Your thoughts betray you, Anakin. You have made a commitment to the Jedi Order, a commitment not easily broken. And don’t forget, she’s a politician, and they’re not to be trusted.
anakin_skywalker She’s not like the other senators, Master.
obiwan_kenobi It is my experience that senators focus only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns. And they’re in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy in order to get those funds.
anakin_skywalker Not another lecture… at least not on the economics of politics.
anakin_skywalker And besides, you’re generalizing. The Chancellor doesn’t appear to be corrupt.
obiwan_kenobi Palpatine is a politician. I have observed that he is very clever in following the passions and the prejudices of senators.
anakin_skywalker I think he is a good man. But-
obiwan_kenobi I sense it, too!
anakin_skywalker Stay here!
dorme Are you all right, milady?
alien_in_speeder#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 What the-?
obiwan_kenobi What took you so long?
anakin_skywalker Oh… ah… you know, Master. I couldn’t find a speeder that I really liked.
obiwan_kenobi There he is. anakin_skywalker With the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities…
obiwan_kenobi If you spent as much time practicing your saber techniques as you did your wit you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.
anakin_skywalker I thought I already did
obiwan_kenobi Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.
obiwan_kenobi Pull up Anakin. Pull up!
anakin_skywalker Whoa-oa!
obiwan_kenobi You know I don’t like it when you do that!
anakin_skywalker Sorry, Master. I forgot you don’t like flying.
obiwan_kenobi I don’t mind flying, but what you’re doing is suicide!
anakin_skywalker Ow- ow- ow- ow- ow…
obiwan_kenobi Anakin! How many times have I told you to stay- away- from- power- couplings…! That was good!
obiwan_kenobi Where are you going? He went that way!
anakin_skywalker Master, if we keep this chase going any longer that creep is gonna end up deep-fried. Personally, I’d like to know who he is and who he’s working for. This is a shortcut… I think.
obiwan_kenobi Well, you’ve lost him.
anakin_skywalker I’m deeply sorry master.
obiwan_kenobi That was some shortcut, Anakin. He went completely the other way. Once again you’ve proved-
anakin_skywalker If you’ll excuse me…
obiwan_kenobi I hate it when he does that.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin!
anakin_skywalker She went into the club, Master!
obiwan_kenobi Patience. Use the Force. Think.
anakin_skywalker Sorry, Master.
obiwan_kenobi He went in there to hide, not to run.
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
obiwan_kenobi Next time, try not to lose it.
anakin_skywalker I try, Master.
obiwan_kenobi Why do I get the feeling you’re going to be the death of me?
anakin_skywalker Don’t say that, Master. You’re the closest thing I have to a father.
obiwan_kenobi Then why don’t you listen to me?
anakin_skywalker I am trying.
obiwan_kenobi Do you see him?
anakin_skywalker I think that he is a she. And I think that she is a Changeling.
obiwan_kenobi In that case be extra careful. Go and find her.
anakin_skywalker Where are you going, Master?
obiwan_kenobi For a drink.
obiwan_kenobi Thank you.
stranger#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 You want to buy some death sticks?
obiwan_kenobi You don’t want to sell me death sticks.
stranger#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Oh… uh… I don’t want to sell you death sticks.
obiwan_kenobi You want to go home and rethink your life.
stranger#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 I want to go home and… rethink my life…
anakin_skywalker Easy… Jedi business. Go back to your drinks.
obiwan_kenobi Do you know who it was that you were tring to kill?
zam_wesell Mmph… It was a senator from Naboo.
obiwan_kenobi And who hired you?
zam_wesell It was just a job.
anakin_skywalker Who hired you? Tell us. Tell us now!
zam_wesell It was a bounty hunter called-
obiwan_kenobi A toxic dart…
yoda Track down this bounty hunter, you must, Obi-Wan.
mace_windu Most importantly, find out who he’s working for.
obiwan_kenobi What about Senator Amidala? She will still need protecting.
yoda Handle that, your Padawan will.
mace_windu Anakin- escort the Senator back to her home planet of Naboo. She’ll be safer there. And don’t use registered transport. Travel as refugees.
anakin_skywalker As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital.
yoda Until caught, this killer is, our judgment she must respect.
mace_windu Anakin- go to the senate and ask Chancellor Palpatine to speak with her about this matter.
the_emperor I will talk with her. Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order. I know her well enough to assure you of that.
anakin_skywalker Thank you, Your Excellency.
the_emperor And so... they’ve finally given you an assignment! Your patience has paid off.
anakin_skywalker Your guidance rather my patience.
the_emperor You don’t need guidance, Anakin. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then you will be invincible. I have said it many times: you are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.
anakin_skywalker Thank you, Your Excellency.
the_emperor I see you becoming the greatest of all Jedi… even more powerful than Master Yoda.
obiwan_kenobi I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be given this assignment.
yoda The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan.
mace_windu The boy has exceptional skills.
obiwan_kenobi But he still has much to learn, Master. His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.
yoda Yes, yes. A flaw more and more common among
jedi Hmm… Too sure of themselves, they are: even the older, more experienced ones.
mace_windu Remember, Obi-Wan: if the prophecy is true, your apprentice is the only one who can bring the force back into balance.
padme I’m taking an extended leave of absence. It will your responsibility to take my place in the senate. Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.
jar_jar_binks Mesa honored to be taking on disa heavy burden. Mesa accept dis wit moy moy humility and euh…
padme Jar Jar- I don’t wish to hold you up. I’m sure you have a great deal of work to do.
jar_jar_binks Of course… milady.
padme I do not like this idea of hiding.
anakin_skywalker Don't worry.
anakin_skywalker Now that the council has ordered an investigation it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find this bounty hunter.
padme I haven't worked for a year to defeat the Military Creation Act to not be here when its fate is decided.
anakin_skywalker Sometimes we must let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.
padme Anakin, you've grown up.
anakin_skywalker Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.
anakin_skywalker Don't get me wrong.
anakin_skywalker Obi-Wan is a great mentor.
anakin_skywalker As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu.
anakin_skywalker I am truly thankful to be his apprentice.
anakin_skywalker He won't let me move on.
padme That must be frustrating.
anakin_skywalker It's worse.
anakin_skywalker He's overly critical.
anakin_skywalker He never listens.
anakin_skywalker He-He doesn't understand.
anakin_skywalker It's not fair!
padme All mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like.
padme It's the only way we grow.
anakin_skywalker I know.
padme Anakin.
padme Don't try to grow up too fast.
anakin_skywalker But I am grown up.
anakin_skywalker You said it yourself.
anakin_skywalker Please don't look at me like that.
anakin_skywalker Why not?
padme It makes me feel uncomfortable.
anakin_skywalker Sorry, milady.
captain_raymus_antilles#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Be safe, milady.
padme Thank you, Captain.
padme Take good care of Dorm.
padme The threat's on you two now.
dorme He'll be safe with me.
padme You'll be fine.
dorme It's not me, milady.
dorme I worry about you.
dorme What if they realize you've left the capital?
padme Well, then myJedi protector will have to prove how good he is.
padme Anakin.
obiwan_kenobi Don't do anything without first consulting either myself or the council.
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
obiwan_kenobi I'll get to the bottom of this plot quickly, milady.
obiwan_kenobi You'll be back here in no time.
padme I'll be most grateful for your speed, MasterJedi.
anakin_skywalker It's time to go.
anakin_skywalker I know.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, may the Force be with you.
obiwan_kenobi May the Force be with you, Master.
padme Suddenly I'm afraid.
anakin_skywalker This is my first assignment on my own.
anakin_skywalker I am too.
anakin_skywalker Don't worry.
padme We have R2 with us.
obiwan_kenobi I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.
captain_raymus_antilles#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 I'd be more concerned about her doing something than him.
c3po Someone to see ya, honey!
dexter_jettster Obi-Wan!
obiwan_kenobi Hello, Dex.
dexter_jettster Take a seat.
dorme I'll be right with ya.
hermione_bagwa_ You wanna cup o'jawa juice?
madame_jocasta_nu Oh, yes.
anakin_skywalker Thank you.
dexter_jettster Hey, old buddy!
dexter_jettster So, my friend, what can I do for ya?
obiwan_kenobi You can tell me what this is.
dexter_jettster Well, whattaya know!
dexter_jettster I ain't seen one of these since I was prospectin' on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.
obiwan_kenobi Can you tell me where it came from?
anakin_skywalker Thank you.
dexter_jettster This baby belongs to them cloners.
dexter_jettster What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.
obiwan_kenobi I wonder why it didn't show up in the analysis archives.
dexter_jettster It's these funny little cuts on the side that give it away.
dexter_jettster Those analysis droids only focus on symbols.
dexter_jettster I should think that you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and
obiwan_kenobi Well, if droids could think, there'd be none of us here, would there?
madame_jocasta_nu Kamino.
madame_jocasta_nu I'm not familiar with it.
obiwan_kenobi Is it in the Republic?
dexter_jettster It's beyond the outer rim.
dexter_jettster I'd say about, uh, 1 2 parsecs outside the Rishi Maze.
dexter_jettster Should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archives.
dexter_jettster These, uh, Kaminoans keep to themselves.
dexter_jettster They're cloners.
dexter_jettster Damn good ones too.
obiwan_kenobi Cloners.
obiwan_kenobi Are they friendly?
dexter_jettster Oh, depends.
dexter_jettster On how good your manners are and how big your, uh pocketbook is.
madame_jocasta_nu Did you call for assistance?
obiwan_kenobi Yes, yes, I did.
madame_jocasta_nu Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?
obiwan_kenobi Yes, um, I'm looking for a planetary system called Kamino.
madame_jocasta_nu Kamino.
obiwan_kenobi It doesn't show up on the archive charts.
madame_jocasta_nu Kamino.
madame_jocasta_nu It's not a system I'm familiar with.
madame_jocasta_nu Are you sure you have the right coordinates?
obiwan_kenobi According to my information, it should appear in this quadrant here just south of the Rishi Maze.
madame_jocasta_nu I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist.
obiwan_kenobi Perhaps the archives are incomplete.
madame_jocasta_nu If an item does not appear in our records it does not exist.
food_server#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 No droids!
padme Thank you, R2.
padme Must be difficult, having sworn your life to theJedi not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like.
anakin_skywalker Or be with the people that I love.
padme Are you allowed to love?
padme I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
anakin_skywalker Attachment is forbidden.
anakin_skywalker Possession is forbidden.
anakin_skywalker Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love is central to a Jedi's life.
padme You've changed so much.
padme Ah, you haven't changed a bit.
anakin_skywalker You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams.
boba_fett Reach out.
yoda A visitor we have.
children#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Hello, Master Obi-Wan.
anakin_skywalker Hello.
obiwan_kenobi I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.
obiwan_kenobi I'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend.
obiwan_kenobi I trust him, but the systems don't show on the archive maps.
anakin_skywalker Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.
padme -
yoda Gather round the map reader.
obiwan_kenobi Gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot.
yoda Gravity's silhouette remains but the star and all the planets disappeared they have.
yoda How can this be?
obiwan_kenobi A thought?
padme -
padme -
jedi_child_jack#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Because someone erased it from the archive memory.
yoda Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.
yoda Go to the center of gravity's pull and find your planet you will.
obiwan_kenobi But, Master Yoda, who could empty information from the archives?
obiwan_kenobi That's impossible, isn't it?
padme I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough.
padme I'm not sure I was ready.
anakin_skywalker The people you served thought you did a good job.
anakin_skywalker I heard they even tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office.
padme I was relieved when my two terms were up.
padme But when the queen asked me to serve as senator I couldn't refuse her.
anakin_skywalker I think the Republic needs you.
anakin_skywalker I'm glad that you chose to serve.
padme If the senate votes to create an army I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.
sio_bibble It's unthinkable.
sio_bibble There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic.
queen_jamillia Do you see any way through negotiations to bring the separatists back into the Republic?
padme Not if they feel threatened.
sio_bibble It's outrageous, but after four trials in the Supreme Court Nute Gunray is still the viceroy of the Trade Federation.
queen_jamillia We must keep our faith in the Republic.
queen_jamillia The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.
padme Let's pray that day never comes.
queen_jamillia In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.
sio_bibble What is your suggestion, MasterJedi?
obiwan_kenobi Excuse me.
padme I was thinking I would stay in the lake country.
padme There are some places up there that are very isolated.
obiwan_kenobi Excuse me.
anakin_skywalker I'm in charge of security here, milady.
padme I know it very well.
padme That is why we're here.
padme I think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
anakin_skywalker Sorry, milady.
queen_jamillia Perfect.
queen_jamillia It's settled, then.
mace_windu Our missing planet Kamino.
count_dooku MasterJedi.
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 The prime minister is expecting you.
obiwan_kenobi I'm expected?
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Of course.
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 He is anxious to meet you.
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 After all these years we were beginning to think you weren't coming.
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Now, please, this way.
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 May I present Lama Su prime minister of Kamino.
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 And this is MasterJedi-Obi-Wan Kenobi.
lama_su I trust you're going to enjoy your stay.
lama_su And now to business.
lama_su You will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule.
obiwan_kenobi That's good news.
lama_su Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas that his order will be met on time.
padme I'm sorry.
lama_su Master-Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still a leading member of theJedi Council is he not?
anakin_skywalker Yes.
obiwan_kenobi Tell me, Prime Minister when my master first contacted you about the army did-did he say who it was for?
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Of course he did.
obiwan_kenobi This army is for the Republic.
lama_su But you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.
padme That's why I'm here.
padme We used to come here for school retreat.
padme I love the water.
padme We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
anakin_skywalker I don't like sand.
anakin_skywalker It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
anakin_skywalker Not like here.
anakin_skywalker Here, everything is soft and smooth.
padme No.
padme I shouldn't have done that.
padme I'm sorry.
obiwan_kenobi Very impressive.
lama_su I'd hoped you would be pleased.
obiwan_kenobi You mentioned growth acceleration.
lama_su Oh,yes, it's essential.
lama_su Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow.
lama_su Now we can do it in half the time.
lama_su They are totally obedient taking any order without question.
lama_su We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host.
obiwan_kenobi And who was the original host?
lama_su A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
obiwan_kenobi And where is this bounty hunter now?
lama_su Oh, we keep him here.
lama_su Apart from his pay, which is considerable Fett demanded only one thing: an unaltered clone for himself.
lama_su Curious, isn't it?
obiwan_kenobi ''Unaltered''?
lama_su Pure genetic replication.
lama_su No tampering with the structure to make it more docile and no growth acceleration.
obiwan_kenobi I should very much like to meet this Jango Fett.
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 I would be very happy to arrange it for you.
lama_su Magnificent, aren't they?
anakin_skywalker I don't know.
anakin_skywalker Sure you do.
anakin_skywalker You just don't want to tell me.
padme You gonna use one of yourJedi mind tricks on me?
anakin_skywalker They only work on the weak-minded.
padme All right.
padme His name was Palo.
padme We were both in the Legislative Youth Program.
padme He was a few years older than I.
padme Very cute.
padme Dark, curly hair.
padme Dreamy eyes.
anakin_skywalker All right, I get the picture.
obiwan_kenobi Whatever happened to him?
anakin_skywalker Maybe he was the smart one.
padme You really don't like politicians, do you?
anakin_skywalker I like two or three but I'm not really sure about one of them.
anakin_skywalker I don't think the system works.
padme How would you have it work?
anakin_skywalker We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem agree what's in the best interest of all the people, and then do it.
padme That's exactly what we do.
padme The trouble is that people don't always agree.
anakin_skywalker Well, then they should be made to.
padme By whom?
padme Who's gonna make them?
padme You?
anakin_skywalker I don't know.
anakin_skywalker Someone.
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Of course not me.
padme But someone.
children#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Someone wise.
padme Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
anakin_skywalker Well, if it works.
padme You're making fun of me.
padme No.
anakin_skywalker I'd be much too frightened to tease a senator.
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Boba, is your father here?
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Boba, is your father here?
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 May we see him?
boba_fett Sure.
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Was your trip productive?
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Fairly.
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.
taun_we#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 He's come to check on our progress.
obiwan_kenobi Your clones are very impressive.
obiwan_kenobi You must be very proud.
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.
obiwan_kenobi Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Once or twice.
obiwan_kenobi Recently?
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Possibly.
obiwan_kenobi Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Master who?
obiwan_kenobi Sifo-Dyas.
obiwan_kenobi Is he not theJedi who hired you for this job?
anakin_skywalker Never heard of him.
obiwan_kenobi Really?
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 I was recruited by a man called Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.
obiwan_kenobi Curious.
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Do you like your army?
anakin_skywalker I look forward to seeing them in action.
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 They'll do their job well.
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 I'll guarantee that.
obiwan_kenobi Thank you for your time,Jango.
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
boba_fett What is it, Dad?
padme We're leaving.
anakin_skywalker Thank you.
lama_su Oh.
anakin_skywalker If Master Obi-Wan caught me doing this, he'd be very grumpy.
anakin_skywalker From the moment I met you all those years ago not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.
anakin_skywalker And now that I'm with you again I'm in agony.
anakin_skywalker The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.
anakin_skywalker The thought of not being with you-I can't breathe.
anakin_skywalker I'm haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me.
anakin_skywalker My heart is beating hoping that that kiss will not become a scar.
anakin_skywalker You are in my very soul tormenting me.
dexter_jettster What can I do?
anakin_skywalker I will do anything that you ask.
anakin_skywalker If you are suffering as much as I am, please, tell me.
padme I can't.
padme We can't.
padme It'sjust not possible.
anakin_skywalker Anything is possible, Padm.
padme No, you listen.
padme We live in a real world.
padme Come back to it.
padme You're studying to become a Jedi.
padme I'm-I'm a senator.
padme If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion it'll take us to a place we cannot go regardless of the way we feel about each other.
anakin_skywalker Then you do feel something.
padme I will not let you give up your future for me.
anakin_skywalker You are asking me to be rational.
c3po That is something I know I cannot do.
padme I will not give in to this.
anakin_skywalker Well, you know, it wouldn't have to be that way.
anakin_skywalker We could keep it a secret.
padme We'd be living a lie one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to.
padme I couldn't do that.
padme Could you, Anakin?
padme Could you live like that?
padme No.
anakin_skywalker You're right.
anakin_skywalker It would destroy us.
lama_su Tell your council that the first battalions are ready.
lama_su And remind them, if they need more troops it will take more time to grow them.
obiwan_kenobi I won't forget, and thank you.
anakin_skywalker Thank you.
obiwan_kenobi I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we are looking for.
anakin_skywalker No, Master.
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
padme No.
mace_windu Whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of theJedi Council.
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
padme No.
padme No.
anakin_skywalker Mom, no.
padme No.
padme No.
anakin_skywalker Don't go.
padme I don't want to disturb you.
anakin_skywalker Your presence is soothing.
padme You had another nightmare last night.
anakin_skywalker Jedi don't have nightmares.
padme I heard you.
padme I saw my mother.
anakin_skywalker She is suffering, Padm.
anakin_skywalker I saw her as clearly as I see you now.
anakin_skywalker She is in pain.
anakin_skywalker I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator but I have to go.
anakin_skywalker I have to help her.
padme I'll go with you.
padme I'm sorry.
anakin_skywalker I don't have a choice.
boba_fett Dad, look!
anakin_skywalker Let me help you with that.
padme What?
padme Wait!
padme You're a Jedi!
obiwan_kenobi I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
watto Little Ani?

anakin_skywalker It is you!
watto You sure sprouted, huh?
watto AJedi!
dexter_jettster Whattaya know!

anakin_skywalker My mother.
madame_jocasta_nu Oh, yeah.
watto Uh she's not mine-a no more-a.
watto I sold her.
watto You sold her?
watto Years ago.
watto Sorry, Ani, but you know, business is business, huh?
watto Yeah, I sold her to a moisture farmer named, uh, Lars.
watto At least I think it was Lars.
watto Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her!
watto Can ya beat that, eh?
obiwan_kenobi Do you know where they are now?
watto Someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think, mmm.
anakin_skywalker I'd like to know.
obiwan_kenobi Absolutely!
watto Let's go look at my records, huh?
boba_fett Dad!
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Hang on, son.
boba_fett Watch out!
boba_fett Get him, Dad!
boba_fett Get him!
yoda We got him!
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Well, we won't be seeing him again.
padme Stay with the ship, R2.
lama_su Oh!
c3po Oh, Master Ani!
anakin_skywalker I knew it!
c3po Oh, my.
anakin_skywalker Hello, 3PO.
padme I'm so pleased to see you both.
anakin_skywalker I've come to see my mother.
lama_su Oh.
c3po Um, I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.
anakin_skywalker I'm Anakin Skywalker.
owen_lars Owen Lars.
owen_lars Uh, this is my girlfriend, Beru.
anakin_skywalker Hello.
padme I'm Padm.
owen_lars I guess I'm your stepbrother.
owen_lars I had a feeling you might show up someday.
anakin_skywalker Is my mother here?
cliegg_lars No, she's not.
cliegg_lars Cliegg Lars.
cliegg_lars Shmi is my wife.
madame_jocasta_nu We have a lot to talk about.
cliegg_lars It was just before dawn.
cliegg_lars They came out of nowhere.
cliegg_lars A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.
cliegg_lars Your mother had gone out early, like she always did to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators.
cliegg_lars From the tracks, she was about halfway home when they took her.
cliegg_lars Those Tuskens walk like men but they're vicious, mindless monsters.
cliegg_lars Thirty of us went out after her.
cliegg_lars Four of us came back.
cliegg_lars I don't want to give up on her but she's been gone a month.
owen_lars Where are you going?
padme To find my mother.
cliegg_lars Accept it.
anakin_skywalker You're gonna have to stay here.
anakin_skywalker These are good people, Padm.
padme You'll be safe.
anakin_skywalker Anakin-I won't be long.
anakin_skywalker Mom.
anakin_skywalker Mom?
anakin_skywalker Mom?
anakin_skywalker Is it you?
anakin_skywalker I'm here, Mom.
padme You're safe.
shmi_skywalker Oh, you look so handsome.
shmi_skywalker My son.
anakin_skywalker Oh, my grown-up son.
shmi_skywalker I'm so proud of you, Ani.
shmi_skywalker I missed you.
shmi_skywalker Now I am complete.
anakin_skywalker I love y-Stay with me, Mom.
padme Anakin!
padme Anakin!
boba_fett What is it?
padme Anakin?
obiwan_kenobi This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
padme Anakin?
obiwan_kenobi He's not on Naboo, R4.
ruwee_naberrie I do hope nothing's happened to him.
padme Anakin?
obiwan_kenobi This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.
anakin_skywalker I brought you something.
padme Are you hungry?
anakin_skywalker I know I could have!
padme I promise you.
padme Anakin.
dexter_jettster They're dead.
anakin_skywalker And thank you.
shmi_skywalker I miss you so much.
owen_lars What are you doing here?
obiwan_kenobi The Commerce Guilds and the Corporate Alliance have both pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming a-Wait.
padme Wait.
anakin_skywalker I agree.
mace_windu Anakin, we will deal with Count Dooku.
mace_windu The most important thing for you is to stay where you are.
mace_windu Protect the senator at all costs.
mace_windu That is your first priority.
anakin_skywalker Understood, Master.
padme They'll never get there in time to save him.
padme They have to come halfway across the galaxy.
padme Look.
padme Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
anakin_skywalker If he's still alive.
padme Ani, are you just gonna sit here and let him die?
padme He's your friend, your mentor.
anakin_skywalker He gave me strict orders to stay here!
padme He gave you strict orders to protect me and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.
padme If you plan to protect me, you'll just have to come along.
anakin_skywalker I'm not worried, R2.
senator_bail_organa The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war.
senator_palpatine#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.
senator_bail_organa Unfortunately, the debate is not over.
senator_bail_organa The senate will never approve the use of clones before the separatists attack.
padme This is a crisis.
mas_amedda If only Senator Amidala were here.
dexter_jettster Oh, no, my friend.
padme This is madness.
lama_su I've been tracking a bounty hunter named Jango Fett.
anakin_skywalker I wish he were still alive.
padme No, that's not possible.
anakin_skywalker I don't believe you.
mace_windu I will never join you, Dooku.
jar_jar_binks Senators, ''dellow felagates''.: In response to this direct threat to the Republic mesa propose that the senate give immediately emergency powers to the supreme chancellor.
mas_amedda Order!
senator_palpatine#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling.
senator_palpatine#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 I love democracy.
obiwan_kenobi I love the Republic.
senator_palpatine#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated.
anakin_skywalker Don't worry.
lama_su '' Oh!
owen_lars Where are you going now?
lama_su Oh!
obiwan_kenobi Do you know where you're going?
padme Wait.
anakin_skywalker Padm!
watto Shut me down!
lama_su Oh!
padme I'm scrap.
anakin_skywalker Ahh!
lama_su Oh!
anakin_skywalker Don't be afraid.
anakin_skywalker I'm not afraid to die.
padme I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
padme What are you talking about?
anakin_skywalker I love you.
anakin_skywalker You love me?
padme I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway.
padme I truly deeply love you and before we die, I want you to know.
obiwan_kenobi I was beginning to wonder if you'd got my message.
anakin_skywalker I retransmitted it just as you had requested, Master.
anakin_skywalker Then we decided to come and rescue you.
watto Settle down.
watto Settle down.
poggle_the_lesser Let the executions begin.
anakin_skywalker I've got a bad feeling about this.
anakin_skywalker What about Padm?
anakin_skywalker She can't do that!
anakin_skywalker Jump!
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 This isn't how it's supposed to be!
nute_gunray#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Finish her off!
padme .
count_dooku Patience, Viceroy, patience.
count_dooku She will die.
count_dooku Master Windu, how pleasant of you to join us.
mace_windu This party's over.
count_dooku Brave but, uh, foolish, my old Jedi friend.
count_dooku You're impossibly outnumbered.
padme I don't think so.
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 We'll see.
senator_bail_organa What's all this noise?
lama_su Oh!
anakin_skywalker What did I say?
watto Oh, dear.
c3po I'm terribly sorry about all this.
obiwan_kenobi Excuse me.
padme I'm trapped.
anakin_skywalker I can't get up.
owen_lars R2, what are you doing here?
owen_lars What are you doing?
owen_lars Now where are you taking me?
jobal_naberrie You're singeing my circuits!
jobal_naberrie Now it is finished.
count_dooku Surrender, and your lives will be spared.
mace_windu We will not be hostages to be bartered, Dooku!
count_dooku Then, I'm sorry, old friend.
padme Look!
padme Look!
obiwan_kenobi Hold on!
owen_lars There are too many.
obiwan_kenobi Look over there!
c3po We're gonna need some help!
anakin_skywalker Padm!
anakin_skywalker Put the ship down!
padme Anakin!
obiwan_kenobi Don't let your personal feelings get in the way!
obiwan_kenobi Follow that speeder!
padme I need you!
cliegg_lars We have a job to do!
anakin_skywalker I don't care!
anakin_skywalker Put the ship down!
padme You will be expelled from theJedi order!
anakin_skywalker I can't leave her!
anakin_skywalker You're gonna pay for all theJedi that you killed today, Dooku.
anakin_skywalker I'm taking him now!
padme No!
padme No!
count_dooku As you see, myJedi powers are far beyond yours.
anakin_skywalker Now back down.
padme I don't think so.
count_dooku Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.
count_dooku Yoda holds you in such high esteem.
count_dooku Surely you can do better.
padme Are you all right?
padme No.
padme No.
obiwan_kenobi We've got to get to that hangar.
yoda Hurry!
anakin_skywalker Ahh!
count_dooku But I would have thought you had learned your lesson.
anakin_skywalker I am a slow learner.
padme Anakin!
jango_fett#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Master Yoda.
yoda Count Dooku.
padme Anakin!
anakin_skywalker The Force is with us, Master Sidious.
the_emperor Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.
the_emperor You have done well.
count_dooku The war has begun.
the_emperor Excellent.
anakin_skywalker Everything is going as planned.
anakin_skywalker I agree.
mace_windu Where is your apprentice?
obiwan_kenobi On his way to Naboo, escorting Senator Amidala home.
obiwan_kenobi I have to admit that without the clones, it would not have been a victory.
yoda Victory?
yoda Victory, you say?
children#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Master Obi-Wan, not victory.
yoda Begun the Clone War has.

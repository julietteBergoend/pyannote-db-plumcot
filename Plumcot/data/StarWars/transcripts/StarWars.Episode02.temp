lieutenant#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Senator, we’re making our final approach into Coruscant.
senator_palpatine Very good, lieutenant.
captain_typho We made it. I guess I was wrong. There was no danger at all.
padme cordé!
corde My lady… So sorry… I’ve failed you Senator…
padme No…
captain_typho My lady, we’re still in danger here.
padme I shouldn’t have come back.
captain_typho This vote is very important. You do your duty; cordé did hers, now come.
captain_typho Senator Amidala, Please.
chancellor#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 palpatine I don’t know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.
mace_windu If they do break away-
senator_palpatine I will not let this republic that has stood for a thousand years be split in two. My negotiations will not fail.
mace_windu If they do, you must realize that there aren’t enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We’re Keepers of the Peace, not soldiers.
senator_palpatine Master yoda- do you think it will really come to war?
yoda The Dark Side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is.
hologram_alien#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 The Loyalist Committee has arrived, your Honor.
senator_palpatine Good. Send them in.
senator_palpatine We will discuss this matter later.
yoda Senator Amidala… Your tragedy on the landing platform… terrible. Seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart.
padme Do you have any idea who’s behind this attack?
mace_windu Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of Naboo.
padme I think Count Dooku is behind it.
kiadimundi He’s a political idealist, not a murderer.
mace_windu You know, milady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He couldn’t assassinate anyone it’s not in his character.
yoda But, for certain Senator, in grave danger you are.
senator_palpatine Master Jedi… may I suggest the senator be placed under the protection of your graces.
senator_bail_organa Do you really think that’s a wise decision under these stressful times?
padme Chancellor, if I may comment I do not believe-
senator_palpatine …the situation is that serious. No, but I do, Senator. I realize all too well that additional security may be disruptive for you. But, perhaps, someone you’re familiar with. An old friend, like… Master Kenobi.
mace_windu That’s possible. He’s just returned from a border dispute on Ansion.
senator_palpatine Do it for me, milady, please. The thought of losing you… is unbearable.
mace_windu I’ll have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, milady.
padme Thank you, Master windu.
obiwan_kenobi You seem a little on edge.
anakin_skywalker Not at all.
obiwan_kenobi I haven’t felt you this tense since… since we fell into that nest of gundarks.
anakin_skywalker You fell into that nightmare, Master, and I rescued you. Remember?
obiwan_kenobi Oh… yes. You’re sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath.
anakin_skywalker I haven’t seen her in ten years, master.
jar_jar_binks Obi? Obi! Mesa so smilin’ to seein’ yousa.
obiwan_kenobi Good to see you again, Jar-Jar.
jar_jar_binks Senator padmé! Mesa palos here. Lookie, lookie, Senator. Desa Jedi arriven.
obiwan_kenobi It’s a great pleasure to see you again milady.
padme It has been far too long Master Kenobi. Ani? My goodness, you’ve grown.
anakin_skywalker So have you. Grown more beautiful, I mean. Well, for- for a senator, I mean.
padme Ani, you’ll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.
obiwan_kenobi Our presence here will be invisible, milady, I can assure you.
captain_typho I’m Captain typho of Her Majesty’s security service. Queen Jamilla has been informed of your assignment. I am grateful you’re here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit to.
padme I don’t need more security, I need answers. I want to know who’s trying to kill me.
obiwan_kenobi We’re here to protect you, Senator, not to start an investigation.
anakin_skywalker We will find out who’s trying to kill you, padmé. I promise you.
obiwan_kenobi We will not exceed our mandate, my young Padawan learner.
anakin_skywalker I meant that in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course.
obiwan_kenobi We will not go through this exercise again, anakin, and you will pay attention to my lead.
anakin_skywalker Why?
obiwan_kenobi What?
anakin_skywalker Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security, not Jedi. It’s overkill, Master; investigation is applies in our mandate.
obiwan_kenobi We will do exactly as the Council has instructed… and you will learn your place, young one.
padme Perhaps with merely your presence, the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I will retire.
captain_typho I know I’ll feel better with you here. I’ll have an officer stationed at every floor, and I’ll be in the control center downstairs.
jar_jar_binks Mesa bustin’ with happiness seein’ yousa again, Ani.
anakin_skywalker She hardly even recognized me, Jar-Jar. I’ve thought about her every day since we parted. She’s forgotten me completely.
jar_jar_binks Shesa happy. Happier than mesa seein’ her in a longo time.
obiwan_kenobi You’re focusing on the negative, anakin, be mindful of your thoughts. She was pleased to see us. Now, let’s check the security.
zam_wesell I hit the ship but they used a decoy. bounty hunter We’ll have to try something more subtle this time, zam. My client is getting impatient. Here- take these.
dexs_diner_bounty_hunter Be careful- they’re very poisonous. zam- there can be no mistakes this time.
obiwan_kenobi typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin would try that way. Any activity up here?
anakin_skywalker Quiet as a tomb. I don’t like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
obiwan_kenobi What’s going on?
anakin_skywalker She covered the cameras. I don’t think she liked me watching her.
obiwan_kenobi What is she thinking?
anakin_skywalker She programmed Artoo to warn us if there is an intruder.
obiwan_kenobi There are many other ways to kill a senator.
anakin_skywalker I know, but we also want to catch this assassin, don’t we, Master?
obiwan_kenobi You’re using her as bait.
anakin_skywalker It was her idea. Don’t worry no harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.
obiwan_kenobi It’s too risky. Besides, your senses aren’t that attuned my young apprentice.
anakin_skywalker And yours are?
obiwan_kenobi Possibly.
obiwan_kenobi You look tired.
anakin_skywalker I don’t sleep well anymore.
obiwan_kenobi Because of your mother?
anakin_skywalker I don’t know why I keep dreaming about her.
obiwan_kenobi Dreams pass, in time.
anakin_skywalker I’d much rather dream about padmé. Just being around her is… intoxicating.
obiwan_kenobi Your thoughts betray you, anakin. You have made a commitment to the Jedi Order, a commitment not easily broken. And don’t forget, she’s a politician, and they’re not to be trusted.
anakin_skywalker She’s not like the other senators, Master.
obiwan_kenobi It is my experience that senators focus only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns. And they’re in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy in order to get those funds.
anakin_skywalker Not another lecture… at least not on the economics of politics.
anakin_skywalker And besides, you’re generalizing. The Chancellor doesn’t appear to be corrupt.
obiwan_kenobi palpatine is a politician. I have observed that he is very clever in following the passions and the prejudices of senators.
anakin_skywalker I think he is a good man. But-
obiwan_kenobi I sense it, too!
anakin_skywalker Stay here!
dorme Are you all right, milady?
alien_in_speeder#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 What the-?
dug_in_speeder#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Argh! Jedi poo-doo!
obiwan_kenobi What took you so long?
anakin_skywalker Oh… ah… you know, Master. I couldn’t find a speeder that I really liked.
obiwan_kenobi There he is. anakin With the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities…
obiwan_kenobi If you spent as much time practicing your saber techniques as you did your wit you would rival Master yoda as a swordsman.
anakin_skywalker I thought I already did
obiwan_kenobi Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.
obiwan_kenobi Pull up anakin. Pull up!
anakin_skywalker Whoa-oa!
obiwan_kenobi You know I don’t like it when you do that!
anakin_skywalker Sorry, Master. I forgot you don’t like flying.
obiwan_kenobi I don’t mind flying, but what you’re doing is suicide!
anakin_skywalker Ow- ow- ow- ow- ow…
obiwan_kenobi anakin! How many times have I told you to stay- away- from- power- couplings…! That was good!
obiwan_kenobi Where are you going? He went that way!
anakin_skywalker Master, if we keep this chase going any longer that creep is gonna end up deep-fried. Personally, I’d like to know who he is and who he’s working for. This is a shortcut… I think.
obiwan_kenobi Well, you’ve lost him.
anakin_skywalker I’m deeply sorry master.
obiwan_kenobi That was some shortcut, anakin. He went completely the other way. Once again you’ve proved-
anakin_skywalker If you’ll excuse me…
obiwan_kenobi I hate it when he does that.
obiwan_kenobi anakin!
anakin_skywalker She went into the club, Master!
obiwan_kenobi Patience. Use the Force. Think.
anakin_skywalker Sorry, Master.
obiwan_kenobi He went in there to hide, not to run.
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
obiwan_kenobi Next time, try not to lose it.
anakin_skywalker I try, Master.
obiwan_kenobi Why do I get the feeling you’re going to be the death of me?
anakin_skywalker Don’t say that, Master. You’re the closest thing I have to a father.
obiwan_kenobi Then why don’t you listen to me?
anakin_skywalker I am trying.
obiwan_kenobi Do you see him?
anakin_skywalker I think that he is a she. And I think that she is a Changeling.
obiwan_kenobi In that case be extra careful. Go and find her.
anakin_skywalker Where are you going, Master?
obiwan_kenobi For a drink.
obiwan_kenobi Thank you.
stranger#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 You want to buy some death sticks?
obiwan_kenobi You don’t want to sell me death sticks.
stranger#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Oh… uh… I don’t want to sell you death sticks.
obiwan_kenobi You want to go home and rethink your life.
stranger#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 I want to go home and… rethink my life…
anakin_skywalker Jedi business. Go back to your drinks.
obiwan_kenobi Do you know who it was that you were tring to kill?
zam_wesell Mmph… It was a senator from Naboo.
obiwan_kenobi And who hired you?
zam_wesell It was just a job.
anakin_skywalker Tell us now!
zam_wesell It was a bounty hunter called-
obiwan_kenobi A toxic dart…
yoda Track down this bounty hunter, you must, Obi-Wan.
mace_windu Most importantly, find out who he’s working for.
obiwan_kenobi What about Senator Amidala? She will still need protecting.
yoda Handle that, your Padawan will.
mace_windu anakin- escort the Senator back to her home planet of Naboo. She’ll be safer there. And don’t use registered transport. Travel as refugees.
anakin_skywalker As the leader of the opposition, it will be very difficult to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital.
yoda Until caught, this killer is, our judgment she must respect.
mace_windu anakin- go to the senate and ask chancellor palpatine to speak with her about this matter.
senator_palpatine I will talk with her. Senator Amidala will not refuse an executive order. I know her well enough to assure you of that.
anakin_skywalker Thank you, Your Excellency.
senator_palpatine And so... they’ve finally given you an assignment! Your patience has paid off.
anakin_skywalker Your guidance rather my patience.
senator_palpatine You don’t need guidance, anakin. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then you will be invincible. I have said it many times you are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.
anakin_skywalker Thank you, Your Excellency.
senator_palpatine I see you becoming the greatest of all Jedi… even more powerful than Master yoda.
obiwan_kenobi I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be given this assignment.
yoda The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan.
mace_windu The boy has exceptional skills.
obiwan_kenobi But he still has much to learn, Master. His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.
yoda Yes, yes. A flaw more and more common among
jedi.#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 hmm… too sure of themselves, they are even the older, more experienced ones.
mace_windu Remember, Obi-Wan if the prophecy is true, your apprentice is the only one who can bring the force back into balance.
padme I’m taking an extended leave of absence. It will your responsibility to take my place in the senate. Representative Binks, I know I can count on you.
jar_jar_binks Mesa honored to be taking on disa heavy burden. Mesa accept dis wit moy moy humility and euh…
padme jar jar- I don’t wish to hold you up. I’m sure you have a great deal of work to do.
jar_jar_binks Of course… milady.
senator_palpatine Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, is returning to Coruscant to vote on the critical issue of creating an army to assist the overwhelmed Jedi.
captain_raymus_antilles We made it. I guess I was wrong, there was no danger at all.
padme cordé...
corde ... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I...
queen_amidala No!... No!... No!...
queen_amidala I should not have come back.
captain_raymus_antilles M'Lady, you are still in danger.
captain_raymus_antilles This vote is very important. You did your duty and cordé did hers. Now come. M'Lady, please!
mas_amedda Order! We shall have order! The motion for the Republic to commission an army takes precedent, and that is what we will vote on at this time.
senator_palpatine ...My esteemed colleagues, excuse me... I have just received some tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of the Naboo system... Has been assassinated!
senator_palpatine This grievous blow is especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice, not only in this honourable assembly, but also on her home planet. She was so loved she could have been elected queen for life. She believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom... and as a dear friend.
senator_ask_aak_ How many more Senators will die before this civil strife ends! We must confront these rebels now, and they need an army to do it.
ambassador_darsana#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Why weren't the Jedi able to stop this assassination? We are no longer safe, under their protection.
senator_orn_free_taa The Republic needs more security now! Before it comes to war.
senator_palpatine Must I remind the Senator from Malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists. Peace is our objective here... not war.
queen_amidala My noble colleagues, I concur with the Supreme Chancellor. At all costs, we do not want war!
senator_palpatine It is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the Senator from Naboo, padmé Amidala.
padme Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but, more importantly, I believe this security measure before you, was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army... but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it's passage...
padme I warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do not wish to do it again.
padme Wake up, Senators... you must wake up! If you offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannot believe they do.
senator_orn_free_taa My motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first. That is the rule of law.
senator_palpatine Due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion, we will take up these matters tomorrow. Until then, the Senate stands adjourned.
senator_palpatine I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote, my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.
mace_windu If they do break away -
senator_palpatine No! I will not let that happen!
mace_windu But if they do, you must realise there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers.
senator_palpatine Master yoda, do you think it will really come to war?
yoda Worse than war, I fear... Much worse.
senator_palpatine What?
mace_windu What do you sense, Master?
yoda Impossible to see ... The Dark Side clouds everything. But this I am sure of - Do their duty the Jedi will.
dar_wac#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 The loyalist committee has arrived, my Lord.
senator_palpatine Send them in.
yoda With you the force is strong... young Senator. To see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.
padme Thank you, Master yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind the attack?
mace_windu Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo.
padme I don't wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it.
mace_windu You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn't assassinate anyone, it is not in his character.
kiadimundi He is a political idealist, not a murderer.
yoda In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are.
senator_palpatine Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end?
padme I don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it...
senator_palpatine Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces.
senator_bail_organa Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times?
padme Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the...
senator_palpatine ..."situation is that serious." No, but I do, Senator.
padme Chancellor, please! I don't want any more guards!
senator_palpatine I realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi...
mace_windu That's possible. He has just returned from a Border dispute on Ansion.
senator_palpatine You must remember him, M'Lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict.
padme This is not necessary, Chancellor.
senator_palpatine Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable.
mace_windu I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M'Lady.
yoda Too little about yourself you worry, Senator, and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger, padmé. Accept our help.
senator_palpatine I will not like this Republiv, that has stood for over a thousand years, be split in two
jar_jar_binks Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!
obiwan_kenobi It's Good to see you, too, jar jar.
jar_jar_binks Oops! Wheresa mesa manners? Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I completely forgot myself for a moment there. I have had to learn Diplodiaclect... speak it like a native now. Don't really see the point, actually, but members of the Senate seem to prefer it...
jar_jar_binks ...and this, I take it, is your apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie? Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie? Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen! Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no believen.
anakin_skywalker Hi, jar jar.
jar_jar_binks Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!
jar_jar_binks Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh, dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten myself again.
obiwan_kenobi It's a great pleasure to see you again, M'Lady.
padme It has been far too long Master Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths have crossed again... but I must warn you that I think your presence here is unnecessary.
obiwan_kenobi I'm sure the Jedi Council have their reasons.
padme Annie?? My goodness you've grown.
anakin_skywalker So have you... grown more beautiful, I mean... and much shorter... for a Senator, I mean.
padme Oh Annie, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.
obiwan_kenobi Our presence will be invisible, M'Lady.
captain_raymus_antilles I am very grateful you are here, Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit.
padme I don't need more security, I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me.

jar_jar_binks Mesa busten wit happiness seein Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad times, bombad times.
anakin_skywalker She didn't even recognise me, jar jar. I thought about her every day since we parted... and she's forgotten me completely.
jar_jar_binks Shesa happy. Happier den mesa see-en her in longo time.
obiwan_kenobi anakin, you're focusing on the Negative again. Be mindful of your thoughts. She was glad to see us. Now lets check the security here.
anakin_skywalker Yes, my master.
mace_windu Why couldn't we see this attack on the Senator?
yoda Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force.
mace_windu The propecy is coming true, the Dark Side is growing.
yoda And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future. Only going through the Dark Side can we see.
mace_windu It's been ten years, and the Sith still have no shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this?
yoda ...Out there, they are. A certainty that is.
mace_windu Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice will be able to bring balance to the Force?
yoda Only if he chooses to follow his destiny.
obiwan_kenobi Captain typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here?
anakin_skywalker Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.
obiwan_kenobi What's going on?
anakin_skywalker She covered that camera. I don't think she liked me watching her.

obiwan_kenobi Dreams pass in time.
anakin_skywalker I'd rather dream of padmé. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating.

anakin_skywalker She's not like the others in the Senate, Master.

anakin_skywalker Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics.... It's too early in the morning... and besides, you're generalising. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.
anakin_skywalker I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive about...
obiwan_kenobi I sense it, too.
anakin_skywalker Stay here!
obiwan_kenobi I have a bad feeling about this.
anakin_skywalker That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic.
obiwan_kenobi What took you so long?
anakin_skywalker Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color...
obiwan_kenobi If you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master yoda as a swordsman.
anakin_skywalker I thought I already did.
obiwan_kenobi Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!
anakin_skywalker Sorry, I forgot you don't like flying, Master.
obiwan_kenobi I don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide!
anakin_skywalker Master, you know I've been flying since before I could walk. I'm very good at this.
obiwan_kenobi Just slow down!
zam_wesell WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.
obiwan_kenobi Wait! Don't go in there!
obiwan_kenobi You know I don't like it when you do that!
anakin_skywalker Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this guy's gonna kill himself any minute now!
zam_wesell WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.
obiwan_kenobi What are you doing? He's gonna blast me!
anakin_skywalker Right - this isn't working.
obiwan_kenobi That was too close!
anakin_skywalker Clear that!
obiwan_kenobi What??
anakin_skywalker Clear the flag! We're losing power! Hurry!
obiwan_kenobi Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I don't like it when you do that!
anakin_skywalker So sorry, Master.
obiwan_kenobi It's dangerous near those power couplings! Slow down! Don't go through there!
huge#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.
obiwan_kenobi Yiiii, what are you doing?
anakin_skywalker Sorry, Master!
obiwan_kenobi Oh, that was good...
anakin_skywalker That was crazy!!!
anakin_skywalker Ahh, damn.
obiwan_kenobi Stop!!
anakin_skywalker No, we can make it.
obiwan_kenobi I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm crazy.
anakin_skywalker But it worked... we made it.
obiwan_kenobi It didn't work... we've stalled! And you almost got us killed!
anakin_skywalker I think we're still alive.
obiwan_kenobi It was stupid!
anakin_skywalker I could have made it...
obiwan_kenobi But you didn't!!! And now we've lost him.
anakin_skywalker No we didn’t...
obiwan_kenobi Where are you going?! He went down there, the other way.
anakin_skywalker This is a shortcut... I think.
obiwan_kenobi What do you mean, ‘You think?’ What kind of shortcut?! He went completely the other way! You’ve lost him!
anakin_skywalker Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep’s gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I’d very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who he’s working for...
obiwan_kenobi Oh, so that’s why we’re going in the wrong direction.
obiwan_kenobi Well, you lost him.
anakin_skywalker I’m deeply sorry, Master.
anakin_skywalker Excuse me for a moment.
obiwan_kenobi anakin!
anakin_skywalker She went into that club, Master.
obiwan_kenobi Patience.
obiwan_kenobi Here. Next time try not to lose it.
anakin_skywalker Sorry, Master.
obiwan_kenobi A Jedi's saber is his most precious possession.
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
obiwan_kenobi He must keep it with him at all times.
anakin_skywalker I know, Master.
obiwan_kenobi This weapon is your life!
anakin_skywalker I've heard this lesson before...
obiwan_kenobi finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.
obiwan_kenobi But, you haven't learned anything, anakin.
anakin_skywalker I try, Master.
obiwan_kenobi Why do I think you are going to be the death of me?!
anakin_skywalker Don't say that Master... You're the closest thing I have to a father... I love you. I don't want to cause you pain.
obiwan_kenobi Then why don't you listen to me?!
anakin_skywalker I will. I'll do better, I promise.
obiwan_kenobi Do you see him him?
anakin_skywalker I think he's a she...
obiwan_kenobi Then be extra careful... Check it out.
anakin_skywalker Where are you going, Master?
obiwan_kenobi To get a drink.
close#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.
elan_sleazebaggano Wanna buy some death sticks?
obiwan_kenobi You don't want to sell me death- sticks.
elan_sleazebaggano I don't want to sell you death- sticks.
obiwan_kenobi You want to go home and rethink your life.
elan_sleazebaggano I want to go home and rethink my life.
anakin_skywalker Easy... Official business. Go back to your drinks.
obiwan_kenobi Do you know who it was you were trying to kill?
zam_wesell WESSEL The Senator from Naboo.
obiwan_kenobi Who hired you?
zam_wesell WESSEL It was just a job.
anakin_skywalker Tell us!
zam_wesell WESSEL That Senator's gonna die soon anyway, and the next one won't make the same mistake I did...
obiwan_kenobi This wound's going to need treatment.
anakin_skywalker Who hired you? Tell us... tell us now!
zam_wesell It was a bounty hunter called...
obiwan_kenobi Toxic Dart...
padme Representative Binks. I know I can count on you.
jar_jar_binks Yousa betchen mesa bottums.
padme What?!
jar_jar_binks Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean, I am honoured to accept this heavy burden. I take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride. It is not every day that I am called upon to...
padme You're a good friend, jar jar. I don't wish to hold you up. I'm sure you have a great deal to do.
jar_jar_binks Of course, M'lady.
jar_jar_binks bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling smile... PADME is in a very bad mood.
padme I do not like this idea of hiding.
anakin_skywalker Don't worry. Now that the Council has ordered an investigation, it won't take Master Obi-Wan long to find that bounty hunter.
padme I haven't worked for a year to defeat the "Military Creation Act" not to be here when its fate is decided.
anakin_skywalker Sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.
padme Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. I suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time.
anakin_skywalker Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying to...
padme Annie! No!
anakin_skywalker Please don't call me that.
padme What?
anakin_skywalker Annie...
padme I've always called you that... it is your name, isn't it?
anakin_skywalker It's anakin. When you say Annie it's like I'm still a little boy... and I'm not.
padme I'm sorry, anakin. It's impossible to deny you've... ...that you've grown up.
anakin_skywalker Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it...
padme Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.
anakin_skywalker Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master yoda and as powerful as Master windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only... although I'm a Padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable... Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... I know I started my training late... but he won't let me move on.
padme That must be frustrating.
anakin_skywalker It's worse... he's overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn't understand! It's not fair!
padme I'm sorry... You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew, when he didn't get his way.
anakin_skywalker I'm not whining! I'm not.
padme just smiles at him. DORME laughs in the background.
padme I didn't say it to hurt you.
anakin_skywalker I know...
padme anakin...
padme Don't try to grow up too fast.
anakin_skywalker I am grown up. You said it yourself.
padme Please don't look at me like that.
anakin_skywalker Why not?
padme Because I can see what you're thinking.
anakin_skywalker Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers too?
padme It makes me feel uncomfortable.
anakin_skywalker Sorry, M'lady.
captain_raymus_antilles Be safe, m'lady.
padme Thank you, Captain. Take good care of Dorme... the threat's on you two now.
dorme#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 He'll be safe with me.
padme You'll be fine.
dorme#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 It's not me, M'Lady. I worry about you. What if they realise I'm not you?
padme Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.
obiwan_kenobi anakin, you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council.
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
obiwan_kenobi I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be back here in no time.
padme I will be most grateful for your speed, Master Jedi.
anakin_skywalker Time to go.
padme I know.
obiwan_kenobi May the Force be with you.
anakin_skywalker May the Force be with you, Master.
padme Suddenly, I'm afraid...
anakin_skywalker I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own.
padme There's nothing to worry about... we have Artoo with us.
obiwan_kenobi I hope he doesn't try anything foolish.
captain_raymus_antilles I'd be more concerned about her doing something, than him.
pk4 Place the subject for analysis on the sensot tray, please.
obiwan_kenobi It's a toxic dart. I need to know where it came from and who made it.
pk4 One moment, please.
pk4 As you can see on your screen, subject weapon does not exist in any known culture. Markings cannot be identified. Probablt self-made by a warrior not associated with any known society.
obiwan_kenobi Excuse me? Could you try again please?
pk4 Master Jedi, our records are very thorough. they cover eight percent of the galaxy. If I can't tell you where it came from, nobody can.
obiwan_kenobi Thanks for your assistance! You may not be able to figure this out, but I think I know someone who might.
server#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Keep moving! Keep moving!
food_server#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Hey! No Droids!
anakin_skywalker No, no, Mom, no...
anakin_skywalker What?
padme You seemed to be having a nightmare.
padme Are you hungry?
anakin_skywalker Thank you.
padme We went into lightspeed a while ago.
anakin_skywalker I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen...
padme You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.
anakin_skywalker I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.
padme It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like...
anakin_skywalker Or be with the people I love.
padme Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.
anakin_skywalker Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi's life, so you might say we're encouraged to love.
padme You have changed so much
anakin_skywalker You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.
padme It hasn't...
anakin_skywalker I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force, those hills are what I see.
anakin_skywalker I love Naboo.
padme Were you dreaming about you mother earlier, weren't you?
anakin_skywalker Yes... I left Tatooine so long ago, my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it. Recently I've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. I worry about her.
hermione_bagwa_ Can I help ya?
obiwan_kenobi I'm looking for Dexter.
hermione_bagwa_ Waddya want him for?
obiwan_kenobi He's not in trouble. It's personal.
hermione_bagwa_ Someone to see ya, honey A Jedi, by the looks of him.
dexter_jettster Obi-Wan!
obiwan_kenobi Hey, Dex.
dexter_jettster Take a seat! Be right with ya!
hermione_bagwa_ You want a cup of ardees?
obiwan_kenobi Thank you.
dexter_jettster Hey, ol' buddy!
obiwan_kenobi Hey, Dex.
dexter_jettster So, my friend. What can I do for ya?
obiwan_kenobi You can tell me what this is.
dexter_jettster Well, whattaya know...
dexter_jettster I ain't seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim!
obiwan_kenobi Do you know where it came from?
dexter_jettster grins. He puts the dart down between them.
dexter_jettster This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino Kyberdart.
obiwan_kenobi Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why it didn't show up in any analysis archive.
dexter_jettster It's these funny little cuts on the side give it away... Those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.
obiwan_kenobi Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn't be here, would we? Kamino... doesn't sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?
dexter_jettster No, it's beyond the Outer Rim. I'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damned good ones, too.
obiwan_kenobi then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.
obiwan_kenobi Cloners? Are they friendly?
dexter_jettster It depends.
obiwan_kenobi On what, Dex?
dexter_jettster On how good your manners are... and how big your pocketbook is...
anakin_skywalker If I grew up here, I don't think I'd ever leave.
padme I doubt that.
anakin_skywalker No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers...
padme ...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital, I was very young... I'd never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace.
anakin_skywalker Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?
padme No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the "Refugee Relief Movement." I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I joined the "Apprentice Legislators", then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.
anakin_skywalker The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.
padme Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn't refuse her.
anakin_skywalker I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.
padme I think so too.
queen_jamillia We've been worried about you. I'm so glad you're safe, padmé.
padme Thank you, Your Highness. I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote.
sio_bibble Given the circumstances, Senator, you know it was the only decision Her Highness could have made.
queen_jamillia How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?
padme About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.
sio_bibble It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic!
queen_jamillia Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic?
padme Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.
queen_jamillia The armies of commerce! Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?
padme I'm afraid that, despite the Chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds.
sio_bibble It's outrageous! After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?
queen_jamillia Remember, Counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. That's a move in the right direction.
padme There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.
anakin_skywalker The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told.
queen_jamillia We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.
padme Let's pray that day never comes.
queen_jamillia In the meantime, we must consider your own safety.
sio_bibble signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.
sio_bibble What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?
anakin_skywalker Hey, hold on a minute!
padme Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.
anakin_skywalker Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M'Lady.
padme Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.
anakin_skywalker Sorry, M'Lady.
sio_bibble She is right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain.
queen_jamillia Perfect. It's settled then.
queen_jamillia padmé, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave... your family's very worried about you.
madame_jocasta_nu NU Did you call for assistance?
obiwan_kenobi Yes... yes, I did...
madame_jocasta_nu NU He has a powerful face, doesn't he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing.
obiwan_kenobi I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order.
madame_jocasta_nu NU The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the Order.
obiwan_kenobi What happened?
madame_jocasta_nu NU Well, one might say, he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council... much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
obiwan_kenobi Really?
madame_jocasta_nu NU Oh, yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers... idealists...
madame_jocasta_nu NU stares at the bust
madame_jocasta_nu NU (continuing He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was... unique. In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.
obiwan_kenobi Interesting... I'm still not sure I understand.
madame_jocasta_nu NU Well, I'm sure you didn't call me over here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?
obiwan_kenobi Yes, I'm trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts.
madame_jocasta_nu NU Kamino? It's not a system I'M familiar with... Let me see...
madame_jocasta_nu NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.
madame_jocasta_nu NU Are you sure you have the right co-ordinates?
obiwan_kenobi According to my information, it should be in this quadrant somewhere... just south of the Rishi Maze.
madame_jocasta_nu NU taps the keyboard and frowns.
madame_jocasta_nu NU No co-ordinates? It sounds like the kind of directions you'd get from a street tout... some old miner or Furbog trader.
obiwan_kenobi All three actually.
madame_jocasta_nu NU Are you sure it exists?
obiwan_kenobi Absolutely.
madame_jocasta_nu NU Let me do a gravitational scan.
madame_jocasta_nu NU There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet you're looking for was destroyed.
obiwan_kenobi Wouldn't that be on record?
madame_jocasta_nu NU It ought to be. Unless it was very recent. I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist.
obiwan_kenobi That's impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete.
madame_jocasta_nu NU The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!
padme There's my house!
padme What? Don't say you're shy!
anakin_skywalker No, but I...
ryoo_naberrie &amp; POOJA Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!
padme Ryoo!! Pooja!!
padme I'm so happy to see you! This is anakin. anakin, this is Ryoo, and this is Pooja.
ryoo_naberrie &amp; POOJA Artoo!!!
sola_naberrie They're eating over at Jev Narran's later, Mom. They just had a snack. They'll be fine.
padme anakin, this is my sister, Sola.
sola_naberrie Hello, anakin.
anakin_skywalker Hello.
jobal_naberrie You're just in time for dinner. I hope you're hungry, anakin.
anakin_skywalker A little.
padme He's being polite, Mom. We're starving.
ruwee_naberrie You came to the right place at the right time. Sit down, son.
jobal_naberrie Honey, it's so good to see you safe. We were so worried.
ruwee_naberrie Dear...
jobal_naberrie I know, I know... but I had to say it. Now it's done.
sola_naberrie Well, this is exciting! Do you know, anakin, you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home?
padme Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.
joval#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They didn't tell us it was that serious!
padme It's not, Mom, I promise. Anyway, anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis?
padme He grew up.
jobal_naberrie Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven't you had enough of that life? I certainly have!
padme Mom, I'm not in any danger.
ruwee_naberrie Is she?
anakin_skywalker ...Yes... I'm afraid she is.
padme But not much.
ruwee_naberrie Sometimes I wish I'd traveled more... but I must say, I'm happy here.
anakin_skywalker Padme tells me you teach at the university?
ruwee_naberrie Yes, and before that, I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement, when I was very young.
sola_naberrie Why haven't you told us about him?
padme What's there to talk about? He's just a boy.
sola_naberrie A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you?
padme Sola - stop it!
sola_naberrie It's obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven't noticed?
padme I'm not your baby sister, Sola. anakin and I are friends... our relationship is strictly professional. Mom, would you tell her to stop it?
sola_naberrie Well, maybe you haven't noticed the way he looks at you. I think you're afraid to.
padme Cut it out.
jobal_naberrie Sola's just concerned... we all are.
padme Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What I'm doing is important.
jobal_naberrie You've done your service, padmé. It's time you had a life of your own. You're missing so much!
ruwee_naberrie Now tell me, son. How serious is this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in?
anakin_skywalker There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there'll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I'm sure he'll find out who they are. This situation, won't last long.
ruwee_naberrie I don't want anything to happen to her.
anakin_skywalker I don't either.
padme Don't worry, this won't take long.
anakin_skywalker I just want to get there before dark.
anakin_skywalker You still live at home.
padme I move around so much, I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.
anakin_skywalker I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was.
anakin_skywalker Is this you?
padme That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula, which means sweethear. He was so full of life,. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt... to live off their native planet.
padme My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?
yoda Don't think... feel... be as one with the Force. Help you, it will. Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.
yoda Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan.
children#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!
obiwan_kenobi I am sorry to disturb you, Master.
yoda What help to you, can I be?
obiwan_kenobi I’m looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesn’t show up on the archive maps.
yoda An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try...
obiwan_kenobi This is where it ought to be... but it isn’t. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isn’t.
yoda Most interesting. Gravity’s silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be?
jedi_child_jack#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Because someone erased it from the archive memory.
children#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 That’s right! Yes! That’s what happened! Someone erased it!
jedi_child_may#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away.
obiwan_kenobi stares; YODA chuckles.
yoda Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will.
obiwan_kenobi But Master yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That’s impossible, isn’t it?
yoda Much harder to answer, that question is.
padme When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water.
anakin_skywalker I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.
padme ...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
anakin_skywalker I don’t like sand. It’s coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything’s soft... and smooth...
padme There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.
anakin_skywalker Everything here is magical.
padme You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasn’t.
anakin_skywalker Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway...
padme I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself.
anakin_skywalker I think it's true...
padme I shouldn't have done that.
anakin_skywalker I'm sorry. When I'm around you, my mind is no longer my own.
padme It's the situation... the stress...
anakin_skywalker ...the view.
mace_windu Be wary, this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger.
obiwan_kenobi I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own.
yoda The Council is confident in this decision, Obi-Wan.
mace_windu He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, he weill be the one to bring balance to the Force.
obiwan_kenobi But he still has much to learn. And his abilities have made him... well... arrogant. I realise now what you and Master yoda knew from the beginning... the boy was too old to start the training and...
obiwan_kenobi hesitates.
mace_windu There's something else?
obiwan_kenobi Master, he should not have been given this assignment. I'm afraid anakin won't be able to protect the Senator.
mace_windu Why?
obiwan_kenobi He has a... an emotional connection with her. It's been there since he was boy. Now he's confused... distracted.
mace_windu Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path.
obiwan_kenobi Has Master yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about?
mace_windu Probing the Dark Side is a dangerous process. He could be in seclusion for days... May the force be with you.
padme You did that?
anakin_skywalker What?
padme That! Now stop it!
padme anakin!!
anakin_skywalker I'm not really supposed to do that... for fun, I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be very grumpy.
anakin_skywalker May I tell you something?
padme I don't know.
anakin_skywalker Then how can I tell you?
padme Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.
anakin_skywalker It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.
padme anakin, don't...
anakin_skywalker From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again, I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask...
anakin_skywalker If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me.
padme ...I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.
anakin_skywalker Anything's possible. Padme, please listen...
padme You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.
anakin_skywalker Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.
padme Annie, it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me.
anakin_skywalker I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't.
padme I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love.
anakin_skywalker It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.
padme Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you, anakin? Could you live like that?
anakin_skywalker ...No, you're right. It would destroy us.
taun_we Welcome to Tipoca City, Master Jedi.
taun_we Everything is ready. The Prime Minister expects you.
obiwan_kenobi I'm expected?
taun_we Of course! He is anxious to see you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now please, this way!
taun_we May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino... and this is Master Jedi...
obiwan_kenobi Obi-Wan Kenobi.
lama_su Please...
lama_su indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech.
lama_su I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season.
obiwan_kenobi You make me feel most welcome.
lama_su And now to business. You will be delighted to hear we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million well on the way.
obiwan_kenobi That is... good news.
lama_su Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas that we have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full. He is well, I hope?
obiwan_kenobi I'm sorry Master -&#160;?
lama_su Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?
obiwan_kenobi Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.
lama_su You must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.
obiwan_kenobi That's why I'm here.
padme I don't know...
anakin_skywalker Sure you do... you just don't want to tell me.
padme Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?
anakin_skywalker They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.
padme All right... his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes.
anakin_skywalker All right, I get the picture... whatever happened to him?
padme I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist.
anakin_skywalker Maybe he was the smart one.
padme You really don't like politicians, do you?
anakin_skywalker I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. I don't think the system works.
padme How would you have it work?
anakin_skywalker We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.
padme That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.
anakin_skywalker Then they should be made to.
padme By whom? Who's going to make them?
anakin_skywalker I don't know. Someone.
padme You?
anakin_skywalker Of course not me.
padme But someone.
anakin_skywalker Someone wise.
padme That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
anakin_skywalker Well, if it works...
padme You're making fun of me.
anakin_skywalker On no, I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.
padme You're so bad!
anakin_skywalker You're always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders.
anakin_skywalker then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.
lama_su Magnificent, aren't they?
lama_su We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question.
obiwan_kenobi Who was the original host?
lama_su A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand- picked Jango Fett himself.
obiwan_kenobi Where is this bounty hunter now?
lama_su Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases.
lama_su Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious isn't it?
obiwan_kenobi Unaltered?
lama_su Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration...
obiwan_kenobi I would like to meet this Jango Fett.
taun_we I would be most happy to arrange it, for you.
taun_we bows, and leaves.
obiwan_kenobi You mentioned growth acceleration...
lama_su Oh yes, it's essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time. Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sido-dyas first placed the order, and they're already mature...
obiwan_kenobi And these?
lama_su About five years ago.
lama_su They're immensely superior to droids, capable of independent thought and action.
obiwan_kenobi Very impressive.
lama_su I'd hoped you would be pleased.
obiwan_kenobi Tell me, prime minister, when my Master Sido-dyas first contacted you, did he say the order was for... himself... or?
lama_su Himself? Of course not. This army is for the Republic?
obiwan_kenobi The Repubic?
lama_su We are also very much agasint this Count Dooku and his seccessionist movement. We are proud to be of help to the Republic.
taun_we I have arranged for you to meet Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep well.
obiwan_kenobi Arfour, Arfour...
obiwan_kenobi arfour, relay this, "scramble code five," to courscant care of "the old folks home."
obiwan_kenobi ...I've never heard of a Jedi called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?
mace_windu No. Whoever placed that order was not a Jedi, I can assure you.
obiwan_kenobi I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for.
yoda Who he is working for... discover that, you must.
obiwan_kenobi I will, Master, and I will also find out more about this clone army... May The Force...
mace_windu A clone army! Ordered by someone in the Senate perhaps... Someone's out to start a war.
yoda Inform the chancellor of this, we must.
mace_windu Who do you think this impostor Sido-Dyas, could be?
anakin_skywalker No...No...No...Mom!...Don't, no, don't!
anakin_skywalker Don't go.
padme I don't want to disturb you.
anakin_skywalker Your presence is soothing.
padme You had a nightmare again last night.
anakin_skywalker Jedi don't have nightmares.
padme I heard you.
anakin_skywalker I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering, Padme. She is in pain...They're killing her! I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a choice.
padme Annie, I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won't be disobeying your mandate.
anakin_skywalker What about Master Obi-wan?
padme I guess we won't tell him, will we?
paddy#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as anakin's Starship takes off.
taun_we Boba, is your father here?
taun_we May we see him?
boba_fett Sure.
boba_fett Dad! Taun We's here!
taun_we Welcome back, Jango. Was your trip productive?
jango_fett Fairly.
taun_we This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's come to check on our progress.
jango_fett That right?
obiwan_kenobi Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud.
jango_fett I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi.
obiwan_kenobi Aren't we all?
obiwan_kenobi Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant?
jango_fett Once or twice.
obiwan_kenobi Recently?
jango_fett Possibly...
obiwan_kenobi Then you must know Master Sido- Dyas?
jango_fett Boba, close the door.
boba_fett moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN.
jango_fett Master who?
obiwan_kenobi Sido-Dyas. Isn’t he the Jedi who hired you for this job?
jango_fett Never heard of him. I was recuited by a man called Darth Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden.
obiwan_kenobi No? I thought...
taun_we Sido-Dyas told us to expect him. And he showed up just when your Jedi Master said he would. We have kept the Jedi’s involvement a secret until your arrival, just as your Master requested.
obiwan_kenobi Curious...
jango_fett Do you like your army?
obiwan_kenobi It seems to me it's your army - being that they are all clones of you.
jango_fett They'll do their job well, I'll guarantee that.
obiwan_kenobi I look forward to seeing them in action. Thank you for your time, Jango.
jango_fett Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
boba_fett What is it, Dad?
anakin_skywalker Wait, please.
watto No, not that one - that one!
anakin_skywalker Excuse me, Watto.
watto What?
anakin_skywalker I said excuse me.
watto Shut down.
watto What? I don't know you... What can I do for you? You look like a Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't do it.
anakin_skywalker Let me help you with that.
anakin_skywalker I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
watto Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!
watto You are Annie! It is you! You little womp rat.
watto You sure sprouted Weehoo! A Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe you couldda help wit some daedbeats who owe...
anakin_skywalker My mother...
watto Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine no more. I sold her.
anakin_skywalker Sold her...
watto Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you know, business is business. Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. Least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her. Can ya beat that?
anakin_skywalker Do you know where they are?
watto Long way from here... someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think...
anakin_skywalker I'd like to know.
watto Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's go look in my records.
lama_su Tell your Council the first battalions are ready. And remind them that if they need more troops, we will need time to grow them.
obiwan_kenobi I won't forget.
boba_fett Dad!!
padme Stay with the ship, Artoo.
c3po Good evening. May I help you?
anakin_skywalker Threepio?
c3po Oh, my... oh, my! Master anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padme.
padme Hello, Threepio.
anakin_skywalker I've come to see my mother.
c3po Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry, Master Annie.
padme Threepio, what's happened?
c3po I think we'd better go inside.
c3po Master Lars - Master Owen! Somebody to see you!
owen_lars LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard.
anakin_skywalker I'm anakin Skywalker. I'm here looking for my mother.
owen_lars Owen Lars... I guess I'm your step-brother. This is my girlfriend, Beru.
beru Hello.
padme I'm Padme.
owen_lars I had a feeling you might show up some day.
anakin_skywalker Is my mother here?
cliegg_lars No, she's not.
cliegg_lars LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand.
cliegg_lars Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife... Come on inside. We have a lot to talk about.
cliegg_lars It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusekn Raiders.
cliegg_lars Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos. From the tracks, she was about halfway when they took her. Those Tuskens walk like men, but they're vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. Three more are still out there looking. I'd be with them, only... I just couldn't ride any more... until I heal.
cliegg_lars grimaces, easing his throbbing leg.
cliegg_lars This isn't the way I wanted to meet you, son. This isn't how your mother and I planned it. I don't want to give up on her, but she's been gone a month. There's little hope she's lasted this long.
owen_lars Where are you going?
anakin_skywalker To find my mother.
padme No, Annie!
cliegg_lars She's daed, son. Accept it.
anakin_skywalker I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she's alive.
anakin_skywalker You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padme. You'll be safe.
owen_lars Take my speeder bike.
padme anakin...
anakin_skywalker I trust you'll watch over her, Owen.
owen_lars Don't worry.
anakin_skywalker I won't be long.
jango_fett Nearly there, son.
boba_fett Dad, look!!
jango_fett Hang on!
boba_fett Dad! Watch out!
jango_fett Stay calm, son. We'll be fine. That Jedi won't be able to follow us through this.
boba_fett Got him! Yeahhhhh!
jango_fett We won't see him again.
boba_fett laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.
c3po Please don't leave us, Miss Padme. These people need your help.
padme I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just can't sleep.
c3po That's something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm either active or inactive. There's no in-between.
padme I guess you're lucky.
c3po Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn't expect...
padme You're not happy here?
c3po Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn't wish to trouuble them, it's just... being like this... well, it's embarrassing.
padme Being like what?
c3po Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It's so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing?
padme I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
c3po Of course you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's simply not protocol.
padme Maybe we can do something about it.
c3po I don't think so. Only Master Annie...
padme Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.
c3po Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme. Of course, I'm just not mechanically minded... if you see what I mean.
padme Let's see, if we put this... here...
c3po Ooooh! That's tickles.
padme You'll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold still, please.
anakin_skywalker Mom... Mom... Mom...
shmi_skywalker Annie...? Is it you?
anakin_skywalker I’m here, Mom. You’re safe. Hang on. I’m going to get you out of here...
shmi_skywalker I’m so glad... to see you, Annie... Now... I am complete...
anakin_skywalker Just stay with me, Mom. I’m going to make you well again. Everything’s going to be fine.
shmi_skywalker You look so handsome. My son... my grown-up son. I’m so proud of you, Annie... so proud... I missed you so much... I love...
slow#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.
obiwan_kenobi "Guiding light" to "old folks home."
obiwan_kenobi ...Starships from the Trade Federation and the Commerce Guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on Geonosis.
senator_bail_organa That's outrageous! The treaty forbids the Trade Federation from building up an army. What are they doing?!
obiwan_kenobi The droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity. I am going to go down and investigate. I will bring Jango Fett back home for interrogation.
senator_palpatine Those Geonosian foundries are part of the Techno Union. We will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions.
obiwan_kenobi One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be?
yoda With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be.
mace_windu Our missing apprentice. They are playing their hand at last.
obiwan_kenobi Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army?
yoda Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are.
mace_windu Be careful, Obi-Wan. This investigation is becoming less than routine. Do you need help?
obiwan_kenobi Let me see if I can figure out what's going on first.
senator_bail_organa The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war... there can be no doubt of that.
senator_palpatine Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.
mace_windu We must stop them soon before they're fully ready.
senator_ask_aak_ The debate is over, we need that clone army now!
senator_bail_organa Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The Senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack.
mas_amedda This is a crisis! If the Senate votes the Chancellor emergency powers, he could approve the use of the army in a minute.
senator_palpatine Please, please, I don't wish to have emergency powers. That's too extreme a solution. It's akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi. Master yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis?
mace_windu and YODA look at one another.
yoda Two Hundred,... less or more.
senator_bail_organa With all due respect for the Jedi Order, two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids.
mace_windu Patience. We should wait for Obi- Wan to report back. We don't know that Count Dooku has made a treaty with the Corporate Alliance, it's speculation.
senator_ask_aak_ But we must prepare for the worst. I'm going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session. We must not wait!
senator_palpatine Out of the question, Senator! You and I are too closely aligned. The issue will become partisan and debates will begin. The proposal must come from a neutral source.
mas_amedda If only Senator Amidala were here.
jar_jar_binks steps forward from the back of the group.
jar_jar_binks Supreme Chancellor... my august colleagues, I would be proud to propose the motion in question. This is a grave situation, and I'm sure Senator Amidala, and the Queen of Naboo would agree.
senator_ask_aak_ Thank you, Representative Binks.
senator_palpatine If called upon, I will serve. But it will be the saddest day of my life.
padme There!
c3po Um. How do I look?
owen_lars Great! You look perfect.
c3po Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so happy! Oh, pardon me.
c3po Thank you.
c3po Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
owen_lars Well, Padme, I think he should be yours from now on... I know that is what my Mom would want.
c3po Oh, my!
beru Come topside, everybody! He's back! He's back!
obiwan_kenobi ...Alliance have pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming an... Wait!... ah... attack... I don't... make it... aaaggghhh!
anakin_skywalker I'm going after him!
padme I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant.
anakin_skywalker Yeah, you're right, you're right.
mace_windu We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you, anakin, is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your priority.
anakin_skywalker Understood, Master.
padme They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
anakin_skywalker If he's still alive.
padme Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor...
anakin_skywalker ...He's like my father, but you heard Master windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.
padme He gave you strict orders to protect me...
padme ...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me, you will have to come along.
mace_windu The longer we wait, the stronger Dooku's armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers, in order to be able to use that clone army... We have the authority to go now. We must go now.
yoda Agreed, Master windu. Two hundred Jedi send. Enough, let's hope they are.
mas_amedda Order! Order!!
senator_palpatine In the regrettable absence of Senator Amidala, the chair recognises Senior Representative of Naboo, jar jar Binks.
jar_jar_binks Senators, dellow felagates...
mas_amedda Order! The Senate will accord the Representative the courtesy of a hearing!
jar_jar_binks In response to the direct threat to the Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, I propose that the Senate gives immediate emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor.
jar_jar_binks Who can deny these are exceptional times? Exceptional times demand exceptional measures! Exceptional measures demand exceptional men!
senator_orn_free_taa We won't support a dictator.
jar_jar_binks That is the sentiment every one of us agrees with! And when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again, the power we now give to the Supreme Chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned. Out ancient liberties will be restored to us, burnished even more brightly than before!
senator_palpatine It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracy... I love the Republic. The fact that this crisis is demanding I be given absolute power to tule over you is evident. But I am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process. The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated, I promise you. And all I ask in return is when my current term of office is over, you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace.
mas_amedda We shall proceed to the vote. All those in favor of granting emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor, signal ate at this time... those opposed?
anakin_skywalker Hey, where are you going?
padme To find Obi-Wan.
anakin_skywalker No! You're not!
padme Let go of me!
anakin_skywalker I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous.
padme What?!?
anakin_skywalker It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going, and that's final!
padme Don't you give me orders, Annie! I'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me, restrain me, or direct me! You remember your place, young man. Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It's up to you.
r2d2 BEEPS
c3po Yes, it is, Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility. Even though I'm programmed to understand them, I doubt if I ever shall.
padme It's empty!
padme Wait!
count_dooku Senator Amidala, I've heard so much about you.
padme Count Dooku, I assume.
count_dooku I'm delighted to meet you at last. We have a great deal to discuss, Senator. I hope you can keep your young Jedi under control.
padme Don't worry he's housebroken.
padme You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi- Wan Kenobi. I am formally requesting you turn him over to me, now.
count_dooku He has been convicted of espionage, Senator, and will be executed. In just a few hours, I believe.
padme He is an officer of the Republic. You can't do that.
count_dooku We don't recognise the Republic here, Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance, I could easily hear your plea for clemency.
padme And if I don't join your rebellion, I assume this Jedi with me will also die?
count_dooku I don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will, Senator, but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and I assume you want to do what's in their best interest. Aren't you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't you? Be honest, Senator.
padme The ideals are still alive, Count, even if the institution is failing.
count_dooku You believe in the same ideals we believe in! The same ideals we are striving to make prominent.
padme If what you say is true, you should stay in the Republic and help chancellor palpatine put things right.
count_dooku The Chancellor means well, M'Lady but he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? Senator, the Republic cannot be fixed. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham, a shell game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of greed, called the Republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom.
padme I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guilds, and the others, Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government!
count_dooku Are you willing to betray your Jedi friends? Without your co-operation I can do nothing to stop their execution.
padme What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?
count_dooku I wouldn't think of such an offence. But, there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, M'lady. It has nothing to do with politics, I'm afraid. It's purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I'm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. I'm sorry but if you are not going to co-operate, I must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice. I've done all I can for you.
jango_fett moves over to ANAKIN.
jango_fett I'll take that weapon.
count_dooku You may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young Jedi, but you will not escape.
padme anakin...
sun#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 RIT You have been charged and found guilty of Espionage.
poggle_the_lesser Do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out?
padme You are committing an act of war, Archduke. I hope you are prepared for the consequences.
poggle_the_lesser We build weapons, Senator... that is our business! Of course we're prepared!
nute_gunray Get on with it. Carry out the sentence. I want to see her suffer.
poggle_the_lesser Your other Jedi friend is waiting for you, Senator. Take them to the arena!
anakin_skywalker Don't be afraid.
padme I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
anakin_skywalker What are you talking about?
padme I love you.
anakin_skywalker You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives...
padme I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. My love for you is a puzzle, Annie, for which I have no answers. I can't control it... and now I don't care. I truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know.
anakin_skywalker I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short, I vow to spend the rest of my life with you.
obiwan_kenobi I was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message.
anakin_skywalker I retransmitted it as you requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you.
obiwan_kenobi It looks like you're going a good job so far.
sun#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 RIT The felons before you have been convicted of espionage against the Sovereign System of Geonosis. Their sentence of death is to be carried out in this public arena henceforth.
poggle_the_lesser Let the executions begin!
anakin_skywalker I have a bad feeling about this.
obiwan_kenobi Take the one the left. I'll take the one on the right.
anakin_skywalker What about Padme?
obiwan_kenobi It looks like she's already on top of things.
nute_gunray Foul!! She can't do that... shoot her or something!
anakin_skywalker You okay?
padme Sure! Well, sort of.
anakin_skywalker Jump!!!
nute_gunray This isn't how it's supposed to be! Jango, finish her off.
count_dooku motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.
count_dooku Patiece, Viceroy... she will die. Maybe this is the way it's supposed to end.
c3po Yes, it has been rather a long time. Do you suppose something's happened to them?
r2d2 BEEPS
c3po Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think so. It looks a very dull planet to me. They should be back shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.
count_dooku Master windu, how pleasant of you to join us. You're just in time for the moment of truth. I would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training.
mace_windu Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku. This party's over.
mace_windu signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.
count_dooku Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi friend. You're impossibly outnumbered.
mace_windu I don't think so. One Jedi has to be worth a hundred Geonosians.
count_dooku looks around the great theater. His smile grows.
count_dooku It wasn't the Geonosians I was thinking about. How well do you think one Jedi will hold up against a thousand battle droids?
count_dooku signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.
mace_windu draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.
c3po I don't hear anything. You're scaring me! Stop imagining things!
mace_windu runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.
obiwan_kenobi Someone's got to - shut down - these droids.
mace_windu Don't worry! It's being - taken care of!
plo_koon We've done it! Now we have a chance!
kiadimundi The system's off but they're still active. That's a new feature. They are independent of the control system.
count_dooku Master windu!
count_dooku You have fought gallantly. Worthy of recognition in the history archives of the Jedi Order. Now it is finished. Surrender - and your lives will be spared.
mace_windu We will not be hostages for you to barter with Dooku.
count_dooku Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You will have to be destroyed.
padme Look!
yoda Come on - hurry! Hurry!
yoda More battalions to the left. Encircle them we must, then divide.
c3po I'm sure I heard something, this time. Didn't you? It's probably just a celebration
obiwan_kenobi Hold on! Look over there...
anakin_skywalker It's Dooku, go after him!
anakin_skywalker Padme!!!
anakin_skywalker Put the ship down! Down!
obiwan_kenobi No! Forget her. We have to go after Dooku.
anakin_skywalker No we're not!! Land this ship!
obiwan_kenobi Don't let your personal feelings get in the way. We've got a job to do.
anakin_skywalker I don't care!.. Go back.
obiwan_kenobi anakin! She's all right! Look.
obiwan_kenobi Follow that speeder!
battle_droid CAPTAIN Your Excellency!
count_dooku That won't be necessary, Captain. Stand down. And leave them to me.
obiwan_kenobi We move in together - you slowly on the...
anakin_skywalker I'm taking him now!
obiwan_kenobi anakin, no!
anakin_skywalker You'll pay for all the Jedi you've killed today, Dooku.
count_dooku Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down.
obiwan_kenobi I don't think so.
count_dooku Ah, but if I must.
count_dooku I have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the Dark Side. It gives me infinitely greater power.
obiwan_kenobi You will have to prove it.
count_dooku Grand Master Kenobi, you disappoint me. yoda holds you in such high esteem.
count_dooku parried another cut.
count_dooku Surely you can do better...? No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly, or are you trying to make fun of me? Which is it?
count_dooku come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me out of my misery.
count_dooku increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.
count_dooku That's brave of you, boy - but foolish. I would have thought you'd have learnt your lesson.
anakin_skywalker I'm a slow learner.
count_dooku You have unusual powers, young Padawan. But not enought to save you this time.
anakin_skywalker Don't bet on it!
obiwan_kenobi anakin!
count_dooku Master yoda. At last we shall know who is the most powerful.
yoda Count Dooku. No interest in contests, do I have.
yoda The end for you, Count, this is.
count_dooku ...Not yet...
padme anakin!
clone_captain#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Resistance is at an end, General. What are your orders&#160;?
count_dooku The Force is with us, my Master.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have done well.
count_dooku I bring you good news, my Lord. The war has begun.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode02 Excellent. Everything is going as planned.
mace_windu Where is your apprentice?
obiwan_kenobi On his way back to Naboo. He is escorting Senator Amidala home.
obiwan_kenobi I must admit without the clones, it would not have been a victory.
yoda Victory? Victory, you say?
yoda Not victory, a defeat, it was... Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone War has!

shuttle_captain#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Command station, this is ST-321.
shuttle_captain#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Code clearance blue.
shuttle_captain#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 We're starting our approach.
shuttle_captain#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Deactivate the security shield.
imperial_gunner The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission.
imperial_gunner Stand by.
imperial_gunner You are clear to proceed.
shuttle_captain#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 We're starting our approach.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.
moff_jerjerrod Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.
moff_jerjerrod We're honored by your presence.
darth_vader You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander.
darth_vader I'm here to put you back on schedule.
moff_jerjerrod I assure you, Lord Vader my men are working as fast as they can.
darth_vader Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
moff_jerjerrod I tell you this station will be operational, as planned.
darth_vader The emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
moff_jerjerrod But he asks the impossible.
moff_jerjerrod I need more men.
darth_vader Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
moff_jerjerrod The emperor's coming here?
darth_vader That is correct, Commander and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
moff_jerjerrod We shall double our efforts.
darth_vader I hope so, Commander, for your sake.
darth_vader The emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
c3po Of course I'm worried.
c3po And you should be, too.
c3po Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.
c3po Don't be so sure.
c3po If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt you'd probably short-circuit.
c3po R2, are you sure this is the right place?
c3po I'd better knock, I suppose.
c3po There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
c3po Let's go back and tell Master Luke.
c3po Goodness gracious me!
c3po Ay tuta mishka Jabba du Hutt?
c3po I don't think they're going to let us in, R2.
c3po We'd better go.
lando_calrissian R2, wait!
c3po Oh, dear!
c3po R2, I really don't think we should rush into all this.
c3po Oh!
c3po R2, wait for me!
c3po Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here.
c3po Oh, my!
c3po Oh!
c3po Oh, no.
bib_fortuna Day wonna wonga?
c3po Oh, my!
c3po We bring a message to your master Jabba the Hutt.
c3po And a gift.
c3po Gift?
c3po What gift?
bib_fortuna Ne charda so dehdi.
c3po He says that our instructions are to give it only toJabba himself.
c3po I'm terribly sorry.
c3po I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.
c3po R2, I have a bad feeling about this.
c3po Good morning.
c3po The message, R2, the message.
luke_skywalker Greetings, Exalted One.
luke_skywalker Allow me to introduce myself.
luke_skywalker I am Luke Skywalker Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.
luke_skywalker I know that you are powerful, mightyJabba and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful.
luke_skywalker I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life.
luke_skywalker With your wisdom I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation.
luke_skywalker As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift these two droids.
c3po What did he say?
luke_skywalker Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
c3po This can't be!
c3po R2, you're playing the wrong message.
jabba_the_hutt There will be no bargain.
c3po We're doomed.
jabba_the_hutt I will not give up my favorite decoration.
jabba_the_hutt I like Captain Solo where he is.
c3po R2, look Captain Solo.
c3po And he's still frozen in carbonite.
c3po What could possibly have come over Master Luke?
c3po Was it something I did?
c3po He never expressed any unhappiness with my work.
c3po Ohh!
c3po Ohh!
ninedenine#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Ah, good.
ninedenine#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 New acquisitions.
ninedenine#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 You are a protocol droid are you not?
ninedenine#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 I am C-3PO Yes or no will do.
c3po Oh.
c3po Well, yes.
ninedenine#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 How many languages do you speak?
c3po I am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can Splendid.
ninedenine#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
c3po Disintegrated?
c3po Oh!
ninedenine#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Guard!
ninedenine#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 This protocol droid might be useful.
ninedenine#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back up to His Excellency's main audience chamber.
c3po R2, don't leave me!
c3po Oh!
ninedenine#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 You're a feisty little one but you'll soon learn some respect.
ninedenine#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 I have need for you on the master's sail barge and I think you'll fill in nicely.
luke_skywalker No!
luke_skywalker No!
luke_skywalker No!
han_solo Ah!
boushh I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.
c3po Oh, no.
c3po Chewbacca!
jabba_the_hutt At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.
c3po Yes, I am here, Your Worshipfulness.
c3po Yes?
c3po The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of 25,000.
boushh No less.
boushh No less.
c3po Ohh!
c3po What What did I say?
c3po The mightyJabba asks why he must pay 50,000.
c3po Because he's holding a thermal detonator!
c3po Oh!
jabba_the_hutt This bounty hunter is my kind of scum fearless and inventive.
c3po Jabba offers the sum of 35 and I do suggest you take it.
c3po He agrees!
han_solo Ahh!
boushh Just relax for a moment.
boushh You're free of the carbonite.
boushh You have hibernation sickness.
han_solo I can't see.
boushh Your eyesight will return in time.
han_solo Where am I?
boushh Jabba's palace.
han_solo Who are you?
princess_leia Someone who loves you.
han_solo Leia.
princess_leia I got to get you out of here.
han_solo What's that?
han_solo I know that laugh.
han_solo Hey, Jabba Look, Jabba I was just on my way to pay you back and I got a little sidetracked.
han_solo It's not my fault.
jabba_the_hutt It's too late for that, Solo.
jabba_the_hutt You may have been a good smuggler but now you're Bantha fodder.
jabba_the_hutt Look Take him away.
han_solo Jabba, I'll pay you triple.
han_solo You're throwing away a fortune!
c3po Don't be a fool!
jabba_the_hutt Bring her to me.
princess_leia We have powerful friends.
princess_leia You're going to regret this.
jabba_the_hutt I'm sure.
princess_leia Ugh!
c3po Oh, I can't bear to watch.
c3po Oh!
han_solo Chewie?
han_solo Chewie, is that you?
han_solo Ch-Chewie!
han_solo I can't see, pal.
han_solo What's going on?
han_solo Luke?
han_solo Luke's crazy.
han_solo He can't even take care of himself much less rescue anybody.
han_solo AJedi knight?
han_solo I'm out of it for a little while everybody gets delusions of grandeur.
han_solo I'm all right, pal.
han_solo I'm all right.
luke_skywalker I must speak with Jabba.
luke_skywalker You will take me toJabba now.
luke_skywalker You serve your master well.
luke_skywalker And you will be rewarded.
c3po At last!
c3po Master Luke's come to rescue me.
bib_fortuna Master.
bib_fortuna Gabba nopez Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight.
jabba_the_hutt I told you not to admit him.
luke_skywalker I must be allowed to speak.
luke_skywalker He must be allowed to speak.
jabba_the_hutt You weak-minded fool!
han_solo Ah!
jabba_the_hutt He's using an old Jedi mind trick.
luke_skywalker You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.
jabba_the_hutt Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.
luke_skywalker Nevertheless I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends.
luke_skywalker You can either profit by this or be destroyed.
luke_skywalker It's your choice but I warn you not to underestimate my powers.
jabba_the_hutt I shall enjoy watching you die.
c3po Oh, no!
c3po The rancor!
c3po Oh!
luke_skywalker Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.
jabba_the_hutt They will all suffer for this outrage.
luke_skywalker Han!
han_solo Luke!
han_solo Are you all right?
han_solo Fine.
han_solo Together again, huh?
luke_skywalker Wouldn't miss it.
han_solo How are we doing?
luke_skywalker Same as always.
han_solo That bad, huh?
han_solo Where's Leia?
jabba_the_hutt I'm here.
c3po Oh, dear.
c3po His High Exaltedness, the greatJabba the Hutt has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
han_solo Good.
han_solo I hate long waits.
c3po You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the Pit of Carkoon the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
han_solo Doesn't sound so bad.
c3po In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over 1,000 years.
han_solo On second thought, let's pass on that.
luke_skywalker You should have bargained.
luke_skywalker That's the last mistake you'll ever make.
han_solo I think my eyes are getting better.
han_solo Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
luke_skywalker There's nothing to see.
luke_skywalker I used to live here, you know.
luke_skywalker You're going to die here, you know.
han_solo Convenient.
luke_skywalker Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.
luke_skywalker I've taken care of everything.
c3po Oh.
luke_skywalker Great.
jabba_the_hutt Soon you will learn to appreciate me.
c3po I'm terribly sorry.
c3po R2, what are you doing here?
c3po Well, I can see you're serving drinks but this place is dangerous.
c3po They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us, too.
c3po I wish I had your confidence.
c3po Victims of the almighty Sarlacc His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably.
c3po But should any of you wish to beg for mercy the greatJabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.
han_solo 3PO, you tell that slimy piece of worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us!
han_solo Right?
luke_skywalker Jabba this is your last chance.
luke_skywalker Free us or die.
jabba_the_hutt Move him into position.
jabba_the_hutt Put him in.
luke_skywalker Easy, Chewie.
lando_calrissian Help!
han_solo Where is it?
luke_skywalker Han!
han_solo Chewie!
han_solo Lando!
han_solo Boba Fett?
han_solo Boba Fett?
han_solo Where?
han_solo Lando, grab it!
lando_calrissian Lower it!
han_solo I'm trying!
han_solo - Grab me, Chewie.
han_solo - I'm slipping!
han_solo Grab it!
han_solo Almost You almost got it.
han_solo Gently, now.
han_solo All right.
han_solo Easy, easy.
luke_skywalker Hold me, Chewie.
han_solo Chewie!
han_solo Chewie, give me the gun.
han_solo Don't move, Lando.
han_solo Wait!
lando_calrissian I thought you were blind!
han_solo It's all right!
han_solo Don't move!
lando_calrissian A little higher!
lando_calrissian Just a little higher!
han_solo Chewie, pull us up.
luke_skywalker Up, Chewie.
han_solo Up.
han_solo Come on.
princess_leia We gotta get out of here.
c3po Not my eyes!
c3po Quickly, R2!
luke_skywalker Get the gun!
luke_skywalker Point it at the deck!
luke_skywalker Point it at the deck!
han_solo R2, where are we going?
c3po I couldn't possibly go Aah!
han_solo Come on!
luke_skywalker Let's go.
luke_skywalker And don't forget the droids.
lando_calrissian We're on our way.
luke_skywalker I'll meet you back at the fleet.
princess_leia Hurry.
princess_leia The Alliance should be assembled by now.
luke_skywalker I will.
han_solo Hey, Luke, thanks.
han_solo Thanks for coming after me.
han_solo Now I owe you one.
luke_skywalker That's right, R2.
luke_skywalker We're going to the Dagobah system.
luke_skywalker I have a promise to keep to an old friend.
the_emperor Rise, my friend.
darth_vader The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
the_emperor You've done well, Lord Vader.
the_emperor And now I sense you wish to continue..
the_emperor your search for young Skywalker.
darth_vader Yes, my master.
the_emperor Patience, my friend.
the_emperor In time, he will seek you out.
the_emperor And when he does you must bring him before me.
the_emperor He has grown strong.
the_emperor Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
darth_vader As you wish.
the_emperor Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
yoda That face you make Look I so old to young eyes?
luke_skywalker No, of course not.
the_emperor Yes, I do.
yoda Sick have I become.
yoda Old and weak.
yoda When 900 years old you reach Iook as good you will not, hmm?
yoda Soon will I rest.
c3po Yes.
yoda Forever sleep.
yoda Earned it I have.
luke_skywalker Master Yoda, you can't die.
yoda Strong am I with the Force but not that strong.
yoda Twilight is upon me, and soon night must fall.
yoda That is the way of things the way of the Force.
luke_skywalker But I need your help.
luke_skywalker I've come back to complete the training.
yoda No more training do you require.
yoda Already know you that which you need.
luke_skywalker Then I am a Jedi.
c3po Oh!
yoda Not yet.
yoda One thing remains Vader.
yoda You must confront Vader.
yoda Then, only then, a Jedi will you be.
yoda And confront him you will.
luke_skywalker Master Yoda is Darth Vader my father?
yoda Rest I need.
c3po Yes.
luke_skywalker Yoda, I must know.
yoda Your father he is.
yoda Told you, did he?
c3po Yes.
luke_skywalker Unfortunate that I know the truth?
luke_skywalker No.
jabba_the_hutt I'm sorry.
yoda Remember a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.
yoda Once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny.
yoda Luke Luke do not do not underestimate the powers of the emperor or suffer your father's fate you will.
yoda Luke when gone am I the last of theJedi will you be.
yoda Luke the Force runs strong in your family.
yoda Pass on what you have learned.
han_solo I can't do it, R2.
han_solo I can't go on alone.
obiwan_kenobi Yoda will always be with you.
luke_skywalker Obi-Wan.
luke_skywalker Why didn't you tell me?
luke_skywalker You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
the_emperor Your father was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
obiwan_kenobi He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader.
obiwan_kenobi When that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed.
obiwan_kenobi So what I told you was true from a certain point of view.
luke_skywalker A certain point of view?
obiwan_kenobi Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin was a good friend.
obiwan_kenobi When I first knew him your father was already a great pilot but I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him.
obiwan_kenobi I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi.
obiwan_kenobi I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda.
obiwan_kenobi I was wrong.
luke_skywalker There is still good in him.
obiwan_kenobi He's more machine now than man twisted and evil.
luke_skywalker I can't do it, Ben.
obiwan_kenobi You cannot escape your destiny.
yoda You must face Darth Vader again.
luke_skywalker I can't kill my own father.
obiwan_kenobi Then the emperor has already won.
obiwan_kenobi You were our only hope.
luke_skywalker Yoda spoke of another.
obiwan_kenobi The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
luke_skywalker But I have no sister.
obiwan_kenobi To protect you both from the emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born.
obiwan_kenobi The emperor knew, as I did if Anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him.
obiwan_kenobi That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
han_solo Leia!
luke_skywalker Leia's my sister.
obiwan_kenobi Your insight serves you well.
obiwan_kenobi Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.
obiwan_kenobi They do you credit but they could be made to serve the emperor.
han_solo Well, look at you a general, huh?
lando_calrissian Someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the Battle ofTanaab.
han_solo Well, don't look at me, pal.
han_solo I just said you were a fair pilot.
han_solo I didn't know they were looking for somebody to lead this crazy attack.
lando_calrissian I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.
han_solo Who says they didn't?
han_solo But I ain't crazy.
han_solo You're the respectable one, remember?
mon_mothma The emperor's made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.
mon_mothma The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoint the exact location of the emperor's new battle station.
mon_mothma We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational.
mon_mothma With the imperial fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us it is relatively unprotected.
mon_mothma But most important of all we've learned that the emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.
mon_mothma Many Bothans died to bring us this information.
mon_mothma Admiral Ackbar, please.
admiral_ackbar You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest moon of Endor.
admiral_ackbar Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism.
admiral_ackbar It is protected by an energy shield which is generated from the nearby forest moon of Endor.
admiral_ackbar The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted.
admiral_ackbar Once the shield is down our cruisers will create a perimeter while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.
admiral_ackbar General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.
han_solo Good luck.
han_solo You're going to need it.
admiral_ackbar General Madine.
general_madine We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.
general_madine Disguised as a cargo ship and using a secret imperial code a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.
c3po Sounds dangerous.
princess_leia I wonder who they found to pull that off.
general_madine General Solo, is your strike team assembled?
han_solo Uh, my team's ready.
han_solo I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.
han_solo It's going to be rough, pal.
han_solo I didn't wanna speak for you.
han_solo That's one.
princess_leia General count me in.
voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 I'm with you, too.
princess_leia What is it?
luke_skywalker Ask me again sometime.
han_solo Luke.
han_solo Hi, Han, Chewie.
c3po "Exciting" is hardly the word I would choose.
han_solo Look, I want you to take her.
han_solo I mean it.
han_solo Take her.
han_solo You need all the help you can get.
han_solo She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
lando_calrissian All right, old buddy.
lando_calrissian I know what she means to you.
lando_calrissian I'll take good care of her.
lando_calrissian She won't get a scratch.
han_solo All right?
han_solo Right.
han_solo I got your promise.
han_solo Not a scratch.
lando_calrissian Would you get going, you pirate?
han_solo Good luck.
han_solo You, too.
han_solo Got her warmed?
luke_skywalker She's coming up.
han_solo Yeah, well, I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.
princess_leia Hey, you awake?
han_solo I just got a funny feeling like I'm not gonna see her again.
princess_leia Come on, General, let's move.
han_solo Right.
han_solo Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do.
han_solo Ready, everybody?
luke_skywalker All set.
jabba_the_hutt Here we go again.
han_solo All right, hang on.
darth_vader What is thy bidding, my master?
the_emperor Send the fleet to the far side of Endor.
the_emperor There it will stay until called for.
darth_vader What of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
the_emperor It is of no concern.
the_emperor Soon the rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us.
the_emperor Your work here is finished, my friend.
the_emperor Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
darth_vader Yes, my master.
han_solo If they don't go for this we're gonna have to get out of here pretty quick, Chewie.
controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 We have you on our screen now.
controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Please identify.
han_solo Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.
controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Shuttle Tydirium transmit the clearance code for shield passage.
han_solo Transmission commencing.
princess_leia Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
han_solo It'll work.
han_solo It'll work.
luke_skywalker Vader's on that ship.
han_solo Now, don't get jittery, Luke.
han_solo There are a lot of command ships.
han_solo Keep your distance, though, Chewie but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
han_solo I don't know.
han_solo Fly casual.
darth_vader Where is that shuttle going?
admiral_piett Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?
pilot_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.
darth_vader Do they have a code clearance?
admiral_piett It's an older code, sir, but it checks out.
admiral_piett I was about to clear them.
luke_skywalker I'm endangering the mission.
obiwan_kenobi I shouldn't have come.
han_solo It's your imagination, kid.
han_solo Let's keep a little optimism here.
admiral_piett Shall I hold them?
luke_skywalker No.
darth_vader Leave them to me.
darth_vader I will deal with them myself.
darth_vader As you wish, my lord.
admiral_piett Carry on.
han_solo They're not going for it, Chewie.
controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Shuttle Tydirium deactivation of the shield will commence immediately.
controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Follow your present course.
han_solo I told you it was going to work.
han_solo No problem.
han_solo Oh, I told you it was dangerous here!
princess_leia Should we try and go around?
han_solo It'll take time.
han_solo This whole party will be for nothing if they see us.
han_solo Chewie and I will take care of this.
han_solo You stay here.
princess_leia Quietly.
luke_skywalker There might be more of them out there.
han_solo Hey, it's me.
biker_scout_pushed_off_bike Go for help!
biker_scout_pushed_off_bike Go!
luke_skywalker Great.
han_solo Come on!
princess_leia Over there!
princess_leia Two more of them.
luke_skywalker I see them.
luke_skywalker Wait, Leia!
lando_calrissian Hey, wait!
luke_skywalker Quick.
luke_skywalker Jam their comlink!
luke_skywalker Center switch!
luke_skywalker Move closer!
luke_skywalker Get alongside that one!
c3po Oh!
luke_skywalker Keep on that one!
han_solo I'll take these two!
c3po General Solo, somebody's coming.
c3po Oh!
han_solo Luke!
han_solo Where's Leia?
luke_skywalker She didn't come back?
han_solo I thought she was with you.
luke_skywalker We got separated.
luke_skywalker We better go look for her.
han_solo Take the squad ahead.
han_solo We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
luke_skywalker Come on, R2, we'll need your scanners.
c3po Don't worry, Master Luke.
c3po We know what to do.
c3po And you said it was pretty here.
princess_leia Cut it out!
princess_leia I'm not going to hurt you.
c3po Oh.
princess_leia Well, looks like I'm stuck here.
princess_leia Trouble is, I don't know where here is.
princess_leia Maybe you can help me.
han_solo Come on.
princess_leia I promise I won't hurt you.
princess_leia Now come here.
han_solo All right.
c3po You want something to eat?
luke_skywalker That's right.
han_solo - Come on.
luke_skywalker -
c3po Hmm?
han_solo Look.
admiral_ackbar It's a hat.
princess_leia It's not going to hurt you.
han_solo Look.
princess_leia You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?
princess_leia What is it?
c3po Oh!
biker_scout_pushed_off_bike Freeze!
han_solo Come on, get up!
operator#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Yes, sir.
c3po What the Ya!
han_solo Come on.
princess_leia Let's get out of here.
the_emperor I told you to remain on the command ship.
darth_vader A small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
the_emperor Yes, I know.
darth_vader My son is with them.
the_emperor Are you sure?
darth_vader I have felt him, my master.
the_emperor Strange that I have not.
the_emperor I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear Lord Vader.
darth_vader They are clear, my master.
the_emperor Then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for him.
darth_vader He will come to me?
the_emperor I have foreseen it.
the_emperor His compassion for you will be his undoing.
the_emperor He will come to you and then you will bring him before me.
darth_vader As you wish.
han_solo Luke!
han_solo Luke!
c3po Oh, Master Luke.
luke_skywalker There's two more wrecked speeders back there.
luke_skywalker And I found this.
c3po I'm afraid that R2's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
han_solo I hope she's all right.
luke_skywalker What, Chewie?
luke_skywalker What, Chewie?
han_solo I don't get it.
han_solo It's just a dead animal, Chewie.
han_solo Chewie, wait!
luke_skywalker Don't!
han_solo Nice work.
luke_skywalker Great, Chewie.
luke_skywalker Great.
han_solo Always thinking with your stomach.
jabba_the_hutt Take it easy.
luke_skywalker Let's just figure a way to get out of this thing.
luke_skywalker Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
c3po R2, I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
c3po It's a very long drop!
han_solo Ah.
han_solo Point that thing someplace else.
han_solo Hey!
luke_skywalker Han, don't.
han_solo It'll be all right.
luke_skywalker Chewie, give them your crossbow.
c3po Oh, my head!
c3po Oh, my goodness.
luke_skywalker Do you understand anything they're saying?
c3po Oh, yes, Master Luke.
c3po Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms What are you telling them?
c3po Hello, I think.
c3po I could be mistaken.
c3po They're using a very primitive dialect.
c3po I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
han_solo Why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
c3po I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
han_solo Proper?
c3po It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
han_solo Why, you
han_solo My mistake.
han_solo He's an old friend of mine.
han_solo Hey!
c3po I have a really bad feeling about this.
c3po What did he say?
c3po I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
han_solo Leia!
han_solo Leia!
c3po Your Royal Highness.
the_emperor But these are my friends.
princess_leia 3PO, tell them they must be set free.
han_solo Somehow I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
luke_skywalker 3PO, tell them if they don't do as you wish you'll become angry and use your magic.
c3po But, Master Luke, what magic?
luke_skywalker I couldn't possibly.
luke_skywalker Just tell them.
c3po You see, Master Luke?
luke_skywalker Wait, wait.
c3po Put me down!
lando_calrissian Help!
bib_fortuna Master Luke!
c3po R2, R2, quickly!
c3po Oh!
c3po Oh!
c3po Oh!
c3po Thank goodness.
c3po I never knew I had it in me.
c3po Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.
han_solo What's going on?
han_solo I don't know.
c3po Wonderful.
c3po We are now a part of the tribe.
han_solo Just what I always wanted.
han_solo Short help's better than no help at all.
c3po He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
han_solo How far is it?
han_solo Ask him.
han_solo We need some fresh supplies, too.
han_solo Try and get our weapons back.
han_solo Hurry up, will you?
han_solo I haven't got all day.
princess_leia Luke, what's wrong?
luke_skywalker Leia, do you remember your mother your real mother?
lando_calrissian Just a little bit.
princess_leia She died when I was very young.
luke_skywalker What do you remember?
princess_leia Just images, really.
princess_leia Feelings.
luke_skywalker Tell me.
princess_leia She was very beautiful.
princess_leia Kind but sad.
c3po Why are you asking me this?
luke_skywalker I have no memory of my mother.
c3po I never knew her.
princess_leia Luke, tell me what's troubling you?
luke_skywalker Vader is here.
yoda Now.
luke_skywalker On this moon.
princess_leia How do you know?
luke_skywalker I felt his presence.
darth_vader He's come for me.
luke_skywalker He can feel when I'm near.
luke_skywalker That's why I have to go.
luke_skywalker As long as I stay I'm endangering the group and our mission here.
luke_skywalker I have to face him.
princess_leia Why?
luke_skywalker He's my father.
yoda Your father?
luke_skywalker There's more.
luke_skywalker It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must.
luke_skywalker If I don't make it back you're the only hope for the Alliance.
princess_leia Don't talk that way.
princess_leia You have a power I don't understand and could never have.
luke_skywalker You're wrong, Leia.
princess_leia You have that power, too.
luke_skywalker In time, you'll learn to use it as I have.
yoda The Force is strong in my family.
yoda My father has it.
luke_skywalker I have it.
luke_skywalker And my sister has it.
c3po Yes.
luke_skywalker It's you, Leia.
princess_leia I know.
princess_leia Somehow I've always known.
luke_skywalker Then you know why I have to face him.
luke_skywalker No!
princess_leia If he can feel your presence then leave this place.
princess_leia I wish I could go with you.
luke_skywalker No, you don't.
luke_skywalker You've always been strong.
princess_leia But why must you confront him?
luke_skywalker Because there is good in him.
luke_skywalker I've felt it.
luke_skywalker He won't turn me over to the emperor.
luke_skywalker I can save him.
obiwan_kenobi I can turn him back to the good side.
luke_skywalker I have to try.
han_solo Hey, what's going on?
princess_leia Nothing.
princess_leia I just want to be alone for a little while.
princess_leia Nothing?
biker_scout_pushed_off_bike Come on, tell me.
han_solo What's going on?
han_solo I I can't tell you.
han_solo Could you tell Luke?
han_solo Is that who you could tell?
jabba_the_hutt I'm sorry.
c3po Hold me.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 This is the rebel that surrendered to us.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 He was armed only with this.
darth_vader Good work, Commander.
darth_vader Leave us.
darth_vader Conduct your search and bring his companions to me.
darth_vader Yes, my lord.
darth_vader The emperor has been expecting you.
luke_skywalker I know, Father.
darth_vader So, you have accepted the truth.
luke_skywalker I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.
darth_vader That name no longer has any meaning for me.
luke_skywalker It is the name of your true self.
luke_skywalker You've only forgotten.
luke_skywalker I know there is good in you.
luke_skywalker The emperor hasn't driven it from you fully.
luke_skywalker That was why you couldn't destroy me.
luke_skywalker That's why you won't bring me to your emperor now.
darth_vader I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.
darth_vader Your skills are complete.
darth_vader Indeed you are powerful as the emperor has foreseen.
luke_skywalker Come with me.
darth_vader Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
darth_vader You don't know the power of the dark side.
darth_vader I must obey my master.
luke_skywalker I will not turn and you'll be forced to kill me.
obiwan_kenobi If that is your destiny.
luke_skywalker Search your feelings, Father.
luke_skywalker You can't do this.
luke_skywalker I feel the conflict within you.
luke_skywalker Let go of your hate.
jabba_the_hutt It is too late for me, son.
darth_vader The emperor will show you the true nature of the Force.
darth_vader He is your master now.
luke_skywalker Then my father is truly dead.
princess_leia The main entrance to the control bunker is on the far side of that landing platform.
princess_leia This isn't going to be easy.
han_solo Hey, don't worry.
han_solo Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
c3po What's he saying?
c3po He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
lando_calrissian Admiral, we're in position.
lando_calrissian All fighters accounted for.
admiral_ackbar Proceed with the countdown.
admiral_ackbar All groups assume attack coordinates.
han_solo Don't worry.
lando_calrissian He'll have that shield down on time.
lando_calrissian Or this will be the shortest offensive of all time.
admiral_ackbar All craft, prepare to jump into hyperspace on my mark.
han_solo All right.
imperial_gunner Stand by.
han_solo Back door, huh?
han_solo Good idea.
han_solo It's only a few guards.
han_solo This shouldn't be too much trouble.
princess_leia It only takes one to sound the alarm.
han_solo Then we'll do it real quiet like.
c3po Oh, my!
c3po Princess Leia!
c3po I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
c3po Oh, no.
han_solo There goes our surprise attack.
c3po Look, over there!
biker_scout_pushed_off_bike Stop him!
han_solo Not bad for a little furball.
luke_skywalker There's only one left.
han_solo You stay here.
luke_skywalker We'll take care of this.
luke_skywalker I have decided.
c3po that we shall stay here.
han_solo Hey!
the_emperor Welcome, young Skywalker.
darth_vader I have been expecting you.
the_emperor You'll no longer need those.
the_emperor Guards, leave us.
luke_skywalker I'm looking forward to completing your training.
the_emperor In time, you will call me master.
luke_skywalker You're gravely mistaken.
luke_skywalker You won't convert me as you did my father.
the_emperor Oh, no, my young Jedi.
the_emperor You will find that it is you who are mistaken about a great many things.
darth_vader His lightsaber.
the_emperor Much like your father's.
the_emperor By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side.
obiwan_kenobi So will it be with you.
luke_skywalker You're wrong.
luke_skywalker Soon I'll be dead, and you with me.
the_emperor Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.
c3po Yes.
the_emperor I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.
luke_skywalker Your overconfidence is your weakness.
the_emperor Your faith in your friends is yours.
darth_vader It is pointless to resist, my son.
the_emperor Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.
the_emperor Your friends up there on the sanctuary moon are walking into a trap, as is your rebel fleet.
the_emperor It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator.
the_emperor It is quite safe from your pitiful little band.
the_emperor An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.
the_emperor Oh I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.
lando_calrissian All right, up!
han_solo Move!
han_solo Come on.
luke_skywalker Quickly.
luke_skywalker Quickly.
han_solo Chewie.
princess_leia The fleet will be here any moment.
han_solo Charges!
princess_leia Come on, come on!
c3po Oh, my!
c3po They'll be captured!
han_solo Wait!
han_solo Wait!
han_solo Come back!
c3po R2, stay with me.
biker_scout_pushed_off_bike Freeze!

admiral_ackbar May the Force be with us.
lando_calrissian We've got to get a reading.
lando_calrissian How could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.
lando_calrissian Break off the attack!
lando_calrissian The shield is still up.
red_leader I get no reading.
lando_calrissian Pull up!
lando_calrissian All craft pull up!
admiral_ackbar Take evasive action.
admiral_ackbar Green Group, stick to Holding Sector MV-7.
controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Admiral, we have enemy ships in Sector 47.
admiral_ackbar It's a trap!
lando_calrissian Fighters coming in!
rebel_pilot There's too many of them!
lando_calrissian Accelerate to attack speed.
lando_calrissian Draw their fire away from the cruisers.
wedge Copy, Gold Leader.
han_solo Come, boy.
the_emperor See for yourself.
the_emperor From here, you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance and the end of your insignificant rebellion.
the_emperor You want this don't you?
the_emperor The hate is swelling in you now.
the_emperor Take yourJedi weapon.
the_emperor Use it.
the_emperor I am unarmed.
the_emperor Strike me down with it.
the_emperor Give in to your anger.
the_emperor With each passing moment you make yourself more my servant.
luke_skywalker No.
the_emperor It is unavoidable.
luke_skywalker It is your destiny.
the_emperor You, like your father are now mine.
lando_calrissian All right, move it!
han_solo Come on.
lando_calrissian Hello!
c3po I say, over there!
c3po Were you looking for me?
bunker#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Bring those two down here.
c3po Well, they're on their way.
c3po R2, are you sure this was a good idea?
biker_scout_pushed_off_bike Freeze!
han_solo Don't move!
c3po We surrender.
princess_leia The code's changed.
princess_leia We need R2.
han_solo Here's the terminal.
princess_leia R2, where are you?
princess_leia We need you at the bunker right away.
c3po What do you mean, you're going?
lando_calrissian No, wait!
c3po This is no time for heroics!
han_solo Come back!
lando_calrissian Watch yourself, Wedge.
lando_calrissian Three from above.
red_two Got it.
red_three_ Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.
wedge Cut to the left.
han_solo I'll take the leader.
wedge They're heading for the medical frigate.
navigator#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Pressure steady.
lando_calrissian Only the fighters are attacking.
lando_calrissian I wonder what those Stardestroyers are waiting for.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 We're in attack position, sir.
princess_leia Hold here.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 We're not going to attack?
admiral_piett I have my orders from the emperor himself.
admiral_piett He has something special planned for them.
admiral_piett We only need to keep them from escaping.
the_emperor As you can see, my young apprentice your friends have failed.
the_emperor Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station.
the_emperor Fire at will, Commander.
moff_jerjerrod Fire.
c3po Oh!
lando_calrissian That blast came from the Death Star.
lando_calrissian That thing's operational!
wedge Home 1, this is Gold Leader.
admiral_ackbar All craft prepare to retreat.
lando_calrissian You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
admiral_ackbar We have no choice, General Calrissian.
admiral_ackbar Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
lando_calrissian Han will have that shield down.
lando_calrissian We've got to give him more time.
c3po We're coming!
princess_leia Come on, come on!
c3po Oh, R2, hurry!
c3po Oh, my goodness!
c3po Why did you have to be so brave?
han_solo Eeooow Well, I suppose I could hot-wire this thing.
princess_leia I'll cover you.
lando_calrissian Yes, I said closer.
lando_calrissian Move as close as you can and engage those Stardestroyers at point-blank range!
admiral_ackbar At that close range, we won't last long against those Stardestroyers.
lando_calrissian We'll last longer than we will against that Death Star!
lando_calrissian And we might just take a few of them with us.
rebel_pilot She's going to blow!
ywing_pilot I'm hit!
the_emperor Your fleet is lost and your friends on the Endor moon will not survive.
the_emperor There is no escape my young apprentice.
the_emperor The Alliance will die as will your friends.
han_solo Good.
princess_leia I can feel your anger.
the_emperor I am defenseless.
the_emperor Take your weapon.
the_emperor Strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey towards the dark side will be complete!
han_solo Look!

han_solo I think I got it.
han_solo I got it!
c3po Princess Leia, are you all right?
luke_skywalker Let's see.
han_solo It's not bad.

han_solo She's wounded!
lando_calrissian No, wait!
han_solo I got an idea.
han_solo Good.
the_emperor Use your aggressive feelings, boy.
the_emperor Let the hate flow through you.
darth_vader Obi-Wan has taught you well.
luke_skywalker I will not fight you, Father.
darth_vader You are unwise to lower your defenses.
luke_skywalker Your thoughts betray you, Father.
luke_skywalker I feel the good in you, the conflict.
darth_vader There is no conflict.
darth_vader You underestimate the power of the dark side.
darth_vader If you will not fight then you will meet your destiny.
han_solo Good.
han_solo Good.
lando_calrissian Watch out!
lando_calrissian Squad at.06.
wedge I'm on it, Gold Leader.

control_room_commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Open the back door.
han_solo Throw me another charge.
darth_vader You cannot hide forever, Luke.
luke_skywalker I will not fight you.
darth_vader Give yourself to the dark side.
darth_vader It is the only way you can save your friends.
c3po Yes.
luke_skywalker Your thoughts betray you.
darth_vader Your feelings for them are strong especially for sister.
darth_vader So you have a twin sister.
darth_vader Your feelings have now betrayed her, too.
darth_vader Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me.
darth_vader Now his failure is complete.
darth_vader If you will not turn to the dark side then perhaps she will.
luke_skywalker Never!
han_solo Good!
the_emperor Your hate has made you powerful.
the_emperor Now fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side.
luke_skywalker Never.
darth_vader I'll never turn to the dark side.
luke_skywalker You've failed, Your Highness.
luke_skywalker I am a Jedi like my father before me.
the_emperor So be it Jedi.

lando_calrissian We're on our way.
lando_calrissian Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.
jabba_the_hutt I told you they'd do it!
darth_vader If you will not be turned you will be destroyed.
han_solo Young fool.
the_emperor Only now, at the end do you understand.
darth_vader Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side.
the_emperor You have paid the price for your lack of vision.
luke_skywalker Father, please!
lando_calrissian Help me!
the_emperor Now, young Skywalker you will die.
han_solo I'm going in.
lando_calrissian Here goes nothing.
lando_calrissian Now lock onto the strongest power source.
lando_calrissian It should be the power generator.
wedge Form up.
wedge Stay alert.
wedge We could run out of space real fast.
lando_calrissian Split up and head back to the surface.
lando_calrissian See if you can get a few of those TI E fighters to follow you.
wedge Copy, Gold Leader.
lando_calrissian That was too close.
lando_calrissian We've got to give those fighters more time.
nien_nunb Concentrate all fire on that Super Stardestroyer.
controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode06 Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shields.
admiral_piett Intensify the forward batteries.
admiral_piett I don't want anything to get through!
admiral_piett Intensify forward firepower!
han_solo Luke.
darth_vader Help me take this mask off.
luke_skywalker But you'll die.
darth_vader Nothing can stop that now.
darth_vader Just for once let me look on you with my own eyes.
anakin_skywalker Now go, my son.
darth_vader Leave me.

lando_calrissian All right, Wedge, go for the power regulator on the north tower.
wedge Copy, Gold Leader.
wedge I'm already on my way out.
lando_calrissian Move the fleet away from the Death Star.
c3po They did it!
han_solo I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
princess_leia He wasn't.
han_solo I can feel it.
han_solo Don't you?
c3po Yes.
han_solo All right.
han_solo I understand.
han_solo Fine.
han_solo When he comes back I won't get in the way.
han_solo It's not like that at all.
luke_skywalker He's my brother.

c3po Did you hear that?
not_available They shut down the main reactor.
c3po We'll be destroyed for sure.
c3po This is madness.
c3po We're doomed.
c3po There'll be no escape for the princess this time.
not_available What's that?
not_available R2-D2, where are you?
not_available At last!
c3po Where have you been?
c3po They're heading in this direction.
c3po What are we going to do?
not_available We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel, smashed into who knows what!
not_available Wait a minute.
not_available Where are you going?
imperial_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
darth_vader Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
darth_vader What have you done with those plans?
rebel#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We intercepted no transmissions.
not_available This is a consular ship.
rebel#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We're on a diplomatic mission.
not_available If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador?
not_available Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans, and bring me the passengers!
not_available I want them alive!
han_solo There's one.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Set for stun.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 She'll be all right.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
not_available Hey!
c3po You're not permitted in there.
c3po It's restricted.
c3po You'll be deactivated for sure.
not_available Don't you call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease!
c3po Now come out before somebody sees you.
c3po Secret mission?
c3po What plans?
not_available What are you talking about?
c3po I'm not getting in there.
c3po I'm going to regret this.
chief_pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 There goes another one.
captain_raymus_antilles Hold your fire.
not_available There's no life-forms.
not_available It must have short-circuited.
c3po That's funny.
c3po The damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
not_available Are you sure this thing is safe?
not_available Oh.
obiwan_kenobi Darth Vader.
princess_leia Only you could be so bold.
not_available The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
not_available When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.
darth_vader You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
darth_vader Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.
darth_vader I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
princess_leia I don't know what you're talking about.
princess_leia I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
not_available You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.
darth_vader Take her away!
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Holding her is dangerous.
commander#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.
not_available I've traced the rebel spies to her.
not_available Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.
not_available She'll die before she'll tell you anything.
not_available Leave that to me.
darth_vader Send a distress signal, and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed.
not_available Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship, and no transmissions were made.
the_emperor An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life-forms were aboard.
darth_vader She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.
not_available Send a detachment down to retrieve them- See to it personally, Commander.
darth_vader There'll be no one to stop us this time.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available How did we get into this mess?
c3po I really don't know how.
c3po We seem to be made to suffer.
c3po It's our lot in life.
c3po I've got to rest before I fall apart.
c3po My joints are almost frozen.
c3po What a desolate place this is!
luke_skywalker Where do you think you're going?
c3po Well, I'm not going that way.
c3po It's much too rocky.
c3po This way is much easier.
c3po What makes you think there are settlements over there?
c3po Don't get technical with me.
c3po What mission?
not_available What are you talking about?
not_available I've just about had enough of you.
c3po Go that way.
c3po You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile.
c3po And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it.
c3po No more adventures.
c3po I'm not going that way.
c3po That malfunctioning little twerp.
c3po This is all his fault.
c3po He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.
not_available Wait!
not_available What's that?
not_available A transport.
c3po I'm saved!
c3po Over here!
not_available Hey!
not_available Help!
c3po Please help!
not_available R2?
not_available R2-D2, it is you!
not_available It is you!
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Someone was in the pod.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 The tracks go off in this direction.
SECOND_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Look, sir, droids.
not_available We stopped.
c3po Wake up!
c3po Wake up!
c3po We're doomed.
c3po Do you think they'll melt us down?
c3po Don't shoot!
c3po Don't shoot!
c3po Will this never end?
not_available All right, fine.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Luke!
not_available Luke!
not_available Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.
not_available Doesn't look like we have much of a choice, but I'll remind him.
not_available Yeah, we'll take that red one.
not_available No, not that one.
not_available I suppose you're programmed for etiquette and protocol.
uncle_owen Protocol?
not_available Why, it's my primary function, sir.
not_available I am well-versed in all the customs- I have no need for a protocol droid.
not_available Of course you haven't, sir.
c3po Not in an environment such as this.
not_available That is why I have been programmed- What I really need is a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
not_available Vaporators?
not_available Sir, my firstjob was programming binary load lifters, very similar to your vaporators in most respects.
not_available Can you speak Bocce?
c3po Of course I can, sir.
not_available It's like a second language to me- Yeah, all right.
not_available Shut up.
uncle_owen I'll take this one.
not_available Luke!
uncle_owen Take these two over to the garage, will you?
not_available I want them cleaned up before dinner.
not_available But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters.
uncle_owen You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.
uncle_owen Now come on.
not_available Get to it.
not_available All right.
not_available Come on.
luke_skywalker And the red one.
not_available Come on.
luke_skywalker Well, come on, red.
not_available Let's go.
luke_skywalker Uncle Owen!
not_available Yeah?
luke_skywalker This R2 unit has a bad motivator.
not_available Look.
not_available Hey, what are you trying to push on us?
not_available Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition, a real bargain.
not_available Uncle Owen, what about that one?
uncle_owen What about that blue one?
uncle_owen We'll take that one.
not_available Take this away.
c3po You'll be very pleased with that one, sir.
c3po He really is in first-class condition.
c3po I've worked with him before.
c3po Here he comes.
not_available O.K.
not_available Let's go.
c3po Now, don't you forget this.
c3po Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity.
c3po Thank the maker!
c3po This oil bath is going to feel so good.
c3po I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move.
luke_skywalker Itjust isn't fair.
luke_skywalker Oh, Biggs is right.
luke_skywalker I'm never gonna get out of here.
c3po Is there anything I might do to help?
not_available No.
luke_skywalker Not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock.
c3po I don't think so, sir.
not_available I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things, not on this planet, anyway.
c3po As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
luke_skywalker Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
c3po I see, sir.
luke_skywalker You can call me Luke.
c3po I see, Sir Luke.
not_available Ha ha.
luke_skywalker Just Luke.
not_available Oh And I am C-3 PO, human-cyborg relations.
not_available This is my counterpart R2-D2.
not_available Hello.
luke_skywalker You got a lot of carbon scoring.
luke_skywalker Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
c3po With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the rebellion and all.
luke_skywalker You know of the rebellion against the Empire?
not_available
not_available !
c3po That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
luke_skywalker Have you been in many battles?
c3po Several, I think.
c3po Actually, there's not much to tell.
c3po I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories.
c3po Well, not at making them interesting, anyway.
not_available Well, my little friend, you got something jammed in here real good.
not_available Were you on a Starcruiser or- Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
princess_leia You're my only hope.
luke_skywalker What's this?
c3po "What is what"?
c3po He asked you a question.
c3po What is that?
princess_leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
princess_leia You're my only hope.
princess_leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
princess_leia You're my only hope.
not_available He says it's nothing, sir, merely a malfunction.
c3po Old data.
c3po Pay it no mind.
luke_skywalker Who is she?
luke_skywalker She's beautiful.
c3po I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
c3po I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.
not_available A person of some importance, I believe.
not_available Our captain was attached- Is there any more to this recording?
not_available Behave yourself, R2.
not_available You're going to get us into trouble.
c3po It's all right.
c3po You can trust him.
c3po He's our new master.
not_available He says that he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts, and it's a private message for him.
c3po Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.
c3po Our last master was Captain Antilles.
not_available But with all we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
not_available Obi-Wan Kenobi.
luke_skywalker I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.
c3po I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
not_available I don't know any Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.
luke_skywalker He's kind of a strange old hermit.
princess_leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
luke_skywalker I wonder who she is.
luke_skywalker Sounds like she's in trouble.
not_available I better play back the whole thing.
c3po He says the restraining bolt has short-circuited his recording system.
c3po He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.
luke_skywalker Oh, yeah.
luke_skywalker Well I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off.
luke_skywalker There you go.
not_available Wait a minute.
luke_skywalker Where'd she go?
luke_skywalker Bring her back.
luke_skywalker Play back the entire message.
c3po "What message"?
not_available The one you've just been playing!
c3po The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards.
not_available Luke!
not_available Luke!
luke_skywalker All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
c3po I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
not_available Here.
luke_skywalker See what you can do with him.
luke_skywalker I'll be right back.
c3po Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
c3po No, I don't think he likes you at all.
c3po No, I don't like you, either.
luke_skywalker You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.
uncle_owen What makes you think that?
luke_skywalker Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.
luke_skywalker He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
luke_skywalker I thought he might have meant old Ben.
not_available Do you know what he's talking about?
not_available Mm-mm.
luke_skywalker I wonder if he's related to Ben.
not_available That wizard's just a crazy old man.
not_available Tomorrow, I want you to take that R2 unit to Anchorhead and have its memory erased.
uncle_owen That'll be the end of it.
uncle_owen It belongs to us now.
luke_skywalker But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
uncle_owen He won't.
uncle_owen I don't think he exists anymore.
uncle_owen He died about the same time as your father.
luke_skywalker He knew my father?
uncle_owen I told you to forget it.
not_available Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow.
not_available In the morning, I want them up there on the south ridge working on those condensers.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I think those new droids are gonna work out fine.
not_available In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about me staying on another season?
luke_skywalker And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the academy this year.
not_available You mean the next semester before the harvest?
not_available Sure.
not_available There's more than enough droids.
uncle_owen Harvest is when I need you the most.
not_available It's only one season more.
not_available This year we'll make enough on the harvest that I'll be able to hire more hands and then you can go to the academy next year.
uncle_owen You must understand I need you here, Luke.
luke_skywalker But it's a whole 'nother year!
uncle_owen Look, it's only one more season.
not_available Yeah, that's what you said when Biggs and Tank left.
not_available Where are you going?
luke_skywalker Looks like I'm going nowhere.
not_available I have to go finish cleaning those droids.
aunt_beru Owen, he can't stay here forever.
aunt_beru Most of his friends have gone.
aunt_beru It means so much to him.
uncle_owen I'll make it up to him next year.
uncle_owen I promise.
aunt_beru Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
aunt_beru He has too much of his father in him.
uncle_owen That's what I'm afraid of.
not_available Ooh!
not_available What are you doing hiding back there?
c3po It wasn't my fault, sir.
c3po Please don't deactivate me.
c3po I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning.
c3po Kept babbling on about his mission.
not_available Oh, no.
c3po That R2 unit has always been a problem.
c3po These astro droids are getting quite out of hand.
c3po Even I can't understand their logic at times.
luke_skywalker How could I be so stupid?
luke_skywalker He's nowhere in sight.
luke_skywalker Blast it!
c3po Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
luke_skywalker It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around.
luke_skywalker We'll have to wait until morning.
uncle_owen Luke!
uncle_owen I'm shutting the power down.
not_available All right!
luke_skywalker I'll be there in a few minutes.
luke_skywalker Boy, am I gonna get it.
not_available That little droid's going to cause me a lotta trouble.
c3po Oh, he excels at that, sir.
not_available Come on.
not_available Luke?
not_available Luke!
uncle_owen Have you seen Luke this morning?
aunt_beru He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.
uncle_owen Did he take those two new droids with him?
aunt_beru I think so.
not_available Well, he better have those units in the south range repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay.
not_available Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.
luke_skywalker Dead ahead.
not_available It might be our little R2 unit.
luke_skywalker Hit the accelerator!
luke_skywalker Hey, whoa!
luke_skywalker Where do you think you're going?
not_available Master Luke is your rightful owner now.
not_available We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.
not_available And don't talk to me of your mission, either.
c3po You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here!
not_available No.
not_available It's all right, but I think we'd better go.
luke_skywalker What's wrong with him now?
c3po There are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
not_available Sandpeople, or worse.
not_available Come on.
not_available Let's go have a look.
not_available Come on!
not_available Well, there are two banthas down there, but I don't see any Wait a second.
luke_skywalker They're Sandpeople, all right.
luke_skywalker I can see one of them now.
obiwan_kenobi Hello, there.
obiwan_kenobi Come here, my little friend.
obiwan_kenobi Don't be afraid.
not_available Oh, don't worry.
not_available He'll be all right.
obiwan_kenobi Rest easy, son.
obiwan_kenobi You've had a busy day.
not_available You're fortunate to be all in one piece.
not_available Ben?
not_available Ben Kenobi?
luke_skywalker Boy, am I glad to see you.
obiwan_kenobi The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.
obiwan_kenobi Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?
luke_skywalker This little droid.
not_available I think he's searching for his former master, but I've never seen such devotion in a droid before.
luke_skywalker He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
luke_skywalker Is he a relative of yours?
luke_skywalker Do you know who he's talking about?
not_available Obi-Wan Kenobi?
not_available Obi-Wan.
not_available Now, that's a name I've not heard in a long time.
not_available A long time.
not_available I think my uncle knows him.
luke_skywalker He said he was dead.
obiwan_kenobi Oh, he's not dead.
obiwan_kenobi Not yet.
luke_skywalker You know him?
not_available Well, of course I know him.
obiwan_kenobi He's me.
not_available I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan since, oh, before you were born.
not_available Well, then the droid does belong to you.
not_available I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.
obiwan_kenobi Very interesting.
obiwan_kenobi I think we better get indoors.
not_available The Sandpeople are easily startled, but they'll soon be back, and in greater numbers.
not_available 3 PO.
c3po Where am I?
c3po I must have taken a bad step.
luke_skywalker Can you stand?
luke_skywalker We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.
c3po I don't think I can make it.
c3po You go on, Master Luke.
c3po There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account.
c3po I'm done for.
luke_skywalker No, you're not.
luke_skywalker What kind of talk is that?
obiwan_kenobi Quickly.
obiwan_kenobi They're on the move.
luke_skywalker No, my father didn't fight in the wars.
luke_skywalker He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
obiwan_kenobi That's what your uncle told you.
obiwan_kenobi He didn't hold with your father's ideals.
obiwan_kenobi Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
luke_skywalker You fought in the Clone Wars?
not_available Yes.
obiwan_kenobi I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father.
luke_skywalker I wish I'd known him.
obiwan_kenobi He was the best starpilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior.
obiwan_kenobi I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.
obiwan_kenobi And he was a good friend.
not_available Which reminds me, I have something here for you.
obiwan_kenobi Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
not_available He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.
c3po Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for a while.
not_available Sure.
luke_skywalker Go ahead.
not_available What is it?
not_available It's your father's lightsaber.
obiwan_kenobi This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.
not_available Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.
not_available An elegant weapon for a more civilized age.
not_available For over a thousand generations, the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic, before the dark times, before the Empire.
luke_skywalker How did my father die?
obiwan_kenobi A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights.
obiwan_kenobi He betrayed and murdered your father.
obiwan_kenobi Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
obiwan_kenobi Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
not_available The Force?
obiwan_kenobi The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
obiwan_kenobi It's an energy field created by all living things.
not_available It surrounds us, penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.
not_available Now let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend, and where you come from.
not_available I saw part of a message he was I seem to have found it.
princess_leia General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.
princess_leia Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.
princess_leia I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person.
not_available But my ship has fallen under attack, and I am afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.
princess_leia I have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.
princess_leia My father will know how to retrieve it.
princess_leia You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
princess_leia This is our most desperate hour.
princess_leia Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
princess_leia You're my only hope.
obiwan_kenobi You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
not_available Alderaan?
luke_skywalker I'm not going to Alderaan.
not_available I've got to get home.
luke_skywalker It's late.
luke_skywalker I'm in for it as it is.
obiwan_kenobi I need your help, Luke.
obiwan_kenobi She needs your help.
obiwan_kenobi I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
luke_skywalker I can't get involved.
luke_skywalker I've got work to do.
luke_skywalker It's not that I like the Empire.
not_available I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now.
not_available It's all such a long way from here.
obiwan_kenobi That's your uncle talking.
luke_skywalker My uncle.
not_available How am I ever gonna explain this?
obiwan_kenobi Learn about the Force, Luke.
luke_skywalker Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
luke_skywalker You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
obiwan_kenobi You must do what you feel is right, of course.
general_taggi Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable.
general_taggi The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
general_taggi They're more dangerous than you realize.
general_motti Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station.
not_available The rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate- The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
not_available I have just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
grand_moff_tarkin The last remnants of the old Republic have been swept away.
not_available That's impossible.
general_taggi How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
not_available The regional governors now have direct control over their territories.
not_available Fear will keep the local systems in line- fear of this battle station.
general_taggi And what of the rebellion?
general_taggi If the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
darth_vader The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
general_motti Any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.
general_motti This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
general_motti I suggest we use it.
darth_vader Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
darth_vader The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
general_motti Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
not_available Your sad devotion to that ancient religion hasn't helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels' hidden fortre- I find your lack of faith disturbing.
grand_moff_tarkin Enough of this.
grand_moff_tarkin Vader, release him.
darth_vader As you wish.
grand_moff_tarkin This bickering is pointless.
grand_moff_tarkin Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.
grand_moff_tarkin We will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke.
not_available It looks like the Sandpeople did this, all right.
not_available Look.
not_available There's gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.
not_available It's just, I've never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
not_available They didn't, but we are meant to think they did.
obiwan_kenobi These tracks are side-by-side.
not_available Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers.
not_available These are the same Jawas that sold us R2 and 3PO.
obiwan_kenobi And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople.
obiwan_kenobi Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
not_available But why would imperial troops want to slaughterJawas?
not_available If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to, and that would lead them back home!
obiwan_kenobi Wait, Luke!
not_available It's too dangerous!
luke_skywalker Uncle Owen!
luke_skywalker Aunt Beru!
luke_skywalker Uncle Owen!
darth_vader And now, Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base.
obiwan_kenobi There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.
not_available You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.
luke_skywalker I want to come with you to Alderaan.
not_available There's nothing for me here now.
luke_skywalker I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
obiwan_kenobi Mos Eisley spaceport.
obiwan_kenobi You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
obiwan_kenobi We must be cautious.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 How long have you had these droids?
luke_skywalker Three or four seasons.
not_available They're up for sale if you want them.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Let me see your identification.
obiwan_kenobi You don't need to see his identification.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We don't need to see his identification.
not_available These aren't the droids you're looking for.
not_available These aren't the droids we're looking for.
obiwan_kenobi He can go about his business.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 You can go about your business.
not_available Move along.
not_available I can't abide those Jawas.
c3po Disgusting creatures!
luke_skywalker Go on, go on.
not_available I can't understand how we got by those troops.
luke_skywalker I thought we were dead.
obiwan_kenobi The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.
not_available Do you really think we're gonna find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
not_available Most of the best freighter pilots are to be found here, only watch your step.
obiwan_kenobi This place can be a little rough.
luke_skywalker I'm ready for anything.
not_available Come along, R2.
not_available Hey!
wuher We don't serve their kind here.
not_available What?
not_available Your droids, they'll have to wait outside.
wuher We don't want them here.
luke_skywalker Why don't you wait out by the speeder?
luke_skywalker We don't want any trouble.
c3po I heartily agree with you, sir.
not_available Uh I'll have one of those.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 He doesn't like you.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I don't like you, either.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 You just watch yourself.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We're wanted men.
not_available I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
luke_skywalker I'll be careful.
human#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 You'll be dead!
not_available This little one's not worth the effort.
not_available Come, let me get you something.
rebel#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Aah!
luke_skywalker I'm all right.
not_available Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us.
c3po I don't like the look of this.
han_solo Han Solo.
han_solo I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.
han_solo Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
not_available Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.
not_available Fast ship?
han_solo You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
not_available Should I have?
not_available It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs.
han_solo I've outrun imperial starships.
han_solo Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.
han_solo I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.
han_solo She's fast enough for you, old man.
han_solo What's the cargo?
not_available Only passengers myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked.
not_available What is it, some kind of local trouble?
obiwan_kenobi Let's just say we'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements.
not_available Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?
not_available And it's gonna cost you something extra.
not_available 10,000, all in advance.
not_available 10,000?
luke_skywalker We could almost buy our own ship for that!
not_available But who's gonna fly it, kid, you?
luke_skywalker You bet I could.
luke_skywalker I'm not such a bad pilot myself.
not_available We don't have to sit here and listen- We can pay you 2,000 now plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.
han_solo Seventeen, huh?
not_available O.K.
not_available You guys got yourselves a ship.
han_solo We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
not_available Docking Bay 94.
not_available Ninety-four.
han_solo Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
not_available All right.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We'll check it out.
not_available 17,000!
han_solo Those guys must really be desperate.
han_solo This could really save my neck.
not_available Get back to the ship, get it ready.
obiwan_kenobi You'll have to sell your speeder.
luke_skywalker That's O.K.
luke_skywalker I'm never coming back to this planet again.
greedo Going somewhere, Solo?
han_solo Yes, Greedo.
han_solo As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.
han_solo Tell Jabba that I've got his money.
not_available It's too late.
greedo You should have paid him when you had the chance.
not_available Jabba's put a price on your head so large every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.
greedo I'm lucky I found you first.
not_available Yeah, but this time I've got the money.
greedo If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.
han_solo I don't have it with me.
not_available Tell Jabba- Jabba's through with you.
greedo He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.
han_solo Even I get boarded sometimes.
han_solo Do you think I had a choice?
greedo You can tell that to Jabba.
greedo He may only take your ship.
han_solo Over my dead body.
greedo That's the idea.
not_available I've been looking forward to this for a long time.
han_solo I'll bet you have.
han_solo Sorry about the mess.
darth_vader Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.
not_available It'll be some time before we can extract any information from her.
not_available The final checkout is completed.
imperial_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 All systems are operational.
imperial_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 What course shall we set?
grand_moff_tarkin Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
not_available What do you mean?
not_available I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station.
not_available Set your course for Alderaan.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 With pleasure.
not_available Lock the door, R2.
not_available Check this side of the street.
not_available The door's locked.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Move on to the next.
c3po I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you.
not_available I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.
c3po You watch your language.
not_available All right.
greedo Give it to me.
not_available I'll take it.
not_available Look at this.
not_available Ever since the XP-38 came out, they just aren't in demand.
not_available It'll be enough.
not_available Solo!
not_available Come out of there, Solo!
not_available Right here, Jabba.
not_available I've been waitin' for you.
darth_vader Have you now.
not_available You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?
not_available Han, my boy, you disappoint me.
not_available Why haven't you paid me and why did you fry poor Greedo?
not_available Look, Jabba, next time you want to talk to me, come see me yourself.
not_available Don't send one of these twerps.
not_available Han, I can't make exceptions.
not_available What if everyone who smuggled for me dropped their cargo at the first sign of an imperial starship?
jabba_the_hutt It's not good business.
not_available Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.
han_solo You think I had a choice?
not_available But I got a nice, easy charter.
not_available I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
not_available I just need a little more time.
not_available Han, my boy, you're the best.
not_available So, for an extra 20- Fifteen, Jabba.
not_available Don't push it.
not_available Okay, 15%.
not_available But if you fail me again I'll put a price on your head so big you won't be able to go near a civilized system.
not_available Jabba you're a wonderful human being.
not_available Come on!
obiwan_kenobi If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.
luke_skywalker What a piece of junk!
not_available She'll make.5 past light speed.
han_solo She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
not_available I've made a lot of special modifications myself.
not_available But we're a little rushed, so if you'll just get on board, we'll get outta here.
c3po Hello, sir.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Which way?
not_available All right, men, load your weapons.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Stop that ship!
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Blast them!
not_available Chewie, get us out of here!
c3po Oh, my.
c3po I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
han_solo Looks like an imperial cruiser.
han_solo Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.
not_available Try and hold 'em off.
not_available Angle the deflector shields while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
han_solo Stay sharp.
not_available There's two more comin' in.
not_available They're gonna try and cut us off.
not_available Why don't you outrun 'em?
luke_skywalker I thought you said this thing was fast!
not_available Watch your mouth, kid, or you're gonna find yourself floating home.
han_solo We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.
han_solo Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
not_available We'll lose 'em.
han_solo Here's where the fun begins.
obiwan_kenobi How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
han_solo It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer.
luke_skywalker Are you kidding?
luke_skywalker At the rate they're gaining?
not_available Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dustin' crops, boy!
not_available Without precise calculations, we'd fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova, and that would end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
luke_skywalker What's that flashing?
not_available We're losing a deflector shield.
not_available Go strap yourselves in.
not_available I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.
general_motti We've entered the Alderaan system.
not_available Governor Tarkin.
princess_leia I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.
princess_leia I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
grand_moff_tarkin Charming to the last.
grand_moff_tarkin You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life.
not_available I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
grand_moff_tarkin Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.
grand_moff_tarkin No star system will dare oppose the emperor now.
princess_leia The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
grand_moff_tarkin Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.
not_available In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that will be destroyed first.
grand_moff_tarkin Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet ofAlderaan.
not_available No!
princess_leia Alderaan is peaceful.
princess_leia We have no weapons.
not_available You can't possibly You would prefer another target?
grand_moff_tarkin A military target?
grand_moff_tarkin Then name the system.
not_available I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time.
grand_moff_tarkin Where is the rebel base?
not_available Dantooine.
princess_leia They're on Dantooine.
not_available There.
grand_moff_tarkin You see, Lord Vader?
grand_moff_tarkin She can be reasonable.
grand_moff_tarkin Continue with the operation.
grand_moff_tarkin You may fire when ready.
not_available What?
grand_moff_tarkin You're far too trusting.
not_available Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration, but don't worry.
grand_moff_tarkin We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.
not_available No!
not_available Commence primary ignition.
luke_skywalker Are you all right?
not_available What's wrong?
obiwan_kenobi I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
obiwan_kenobi I fear something terrible has happened.
obiwan_kenobi You'd better get on with your exercises.
han_solo Well, you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs.
not_available I told you I'd outrun them.
not_available Don't everybody thank me at once.
not_available Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about 0200 hours.
not_available Now be careful, R2.
not_available Argh!
c3po He made a fair move.
not_available Screaming about it can't help you.
han_solo Let him have it.
han_solo It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
c3po But, sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
not_available That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose.
han_solo Wookiees are known to do that.
not_available Grrr I see your point, sir.
not_available I suggest a new strategy, R2.
c3po Let the Wookiee win.
not_available Argh!
obiwan_kenobi Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
luke_skywalker You mean it controls your actions?
not_available Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
han_solo Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
luke_skywalker You don't believe in the Force, do you?
han_solo Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.
han_solo I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
not_available There's no mystical energy field controls my destiny.
han_solo It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
obiwan_kenobi I suggest you try it again, Luke.
obiwan_kenobi This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.
luke_skywalker With the blast shield down, I can't even see.
luke_skywalker How am I supposed to fight?
obiwan_kenobi Your eyes can deceive you.
obiwan_kenobi Don't trust them.
obiwan_kenobi Stretch out with your feelings.
not_available You see?
obiwan_kenobi You can do it.
han_solo I call it luck.
obiwan_kenobi In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
not_available Look, good against remotes is one thing.
not_available Good against the living, that's something else.
han_solo Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
luke_skywalker You know, I did feel something.
luke_skywalker I could almost see the remote.
obiwan_kenobi That's good.
not_available You've taken your first step into a larger world.
not_available Yes?
officer_cass#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.
officer_cass#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 They found the remains of a rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.
officer_cass#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
grand_moff_tarkin She lied.
grand_moff_tarkin She lied to us!
darth_vader I told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion.
grand_moff_tarkin Terminate her immediately.
han_solo Stand by, Chewie.
han_solo Here we go.
han_solo Cut in the sublight engines.
not_available What the Arrghh arrgh!
han_solo We've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower.
han_solo Some kind of asteroid collision.
han_solo It's not on any of the charts.
not_available What's going on?
not_available Our position's correct, except no Alderaan.
not_available What do you mean?
luke_skywalker Where is it?
han_solo That's what I'm trying to tell you, kid.
han_solo It ain't there.
han_solo It's been totally blown away.
not_available What?
not_available How?
obiwan_kenobi Destroyed by the Empire.
han_solo The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.
not_available It would take 1,000 ships with more firepower than- There's another ship coming in.
luke_skywalker Maybe they know what happened.
obiwan_kenobi It's an imperial fighter.
luke_skywalker It followed us!
not_available No.
obiwan_kenobi It's a short-range fighter.
han_solo There aren't any bases around here.
han_solo Where did it come from?
luke_skywalker It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
luke_skywalker If they identify us, we're in big trouble.
han_solo Not if I can help it.
han_solo Chewie, jam its transmissions.
not_available It would be as well to let it go.
obiwan_kenobi It's too far out of range.
han_solo Not for long.
obiwan_kenobi A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
not_available He must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.
not_available Well, he ain't gonna be around long enough to tell anybody about us.
luke_skywalker Look at him.
not_available He's heading for that small moon.
han_solo I think I can get him before he gets there.
han_solo He's almost in range.
obiwan_kenobi That's no moon.
obiwan_kenobi It's a space station.
han_solo It's too big to be a space station.
luke_skywalker I have a very bad feeling about this.
not_available Turn the ship around.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I think you're right.
han_solo Full reverse!
han_solo Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
han_solo Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power!
luke_skywalker Why are we still moving towards it?
not_available
not_available !
han_solo We're caught in a tractor beam.
han_solo It's pulling us in!
not_available There's got to be something you can do!
not_available There's nothing I can do about it, kid.
not_available I'm at full power.
not_available I'm gonna have to shut down.
not_available They're not gonna get me without a fight.
not_available You can't win, but there are alternatives to fighting.
not_available Clear Bay 327.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We are opening the magnetic field.
not_available To your stations!
not_available Come with me.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Close all outboard shields.
not_available Yes?
voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.
voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Its markings match those ofa ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
darth_vader They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.
darth_vader She may yet be of some use to us.
not_available Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.
voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Release charge.
not_available 316, report to control.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 There's no one on board, sir.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 It must be a decoy, sir.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.
darth_vader Did you find any droids?
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 No, sir.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.
not_available Send a scanning crew aboard.
not_available I want every part of this ship checked.
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available I sense something, a presence I've not felt since- Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.
not_available I want every part of this ship checked.
not_available There's no one here.
luke_skywalker Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
han_solo I use them for smuggling.
not_available I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.
han_solo This is ridiculous.
han_solo Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam.
not_available Leave that to me.
not_available Damn fool, I knew that you were gonna say that.
not_available Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?
not_available Argh!
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 The ship's all yours.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 All right, let's go.
han_solo Hey, down there!
han_solo Could you give us a hand with this?
not_available TK-421, why aren't you at your post?
not_available TK-421, do you copy?
not_available Take over.
lt_pol_treidum We've got a bad transmitter.
lt_pol_treidum I'll see what I can do.
not_available Grrr!
not_available Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
han_solo Bring them on!
not_available I'd prefer a straight fight to all this sneakin' around.
not_available We've found the computer outlet, sir.
obiwan_kenobi Plug in.
not_available He should be able to interpret the entire imperial network.
not_available He says he's found the main controls to the power beam that's holding the ship here.
c3po He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
c3po The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.
c3po A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
obiwan_kenobi I don't think you boys can help.
obiwan_kenobi I must go alone.
han_solo Whatever you say.
not_available I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
luke_skywalker I want to go with you.
obiwan_kenobi Be patient, Luke.
obiwan_kenobi Stay and watch over the droids.
obiwan_kenobi They must be delivered safely, or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.
not_available Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.
obiwan_kenobi The Force will be with you always.
not_available Argh argh argh!
han_solo You said it, Chewie.
han_solo Where did you dig up that old fossil?
luke_skywalker Ben is a great man.
han_solo Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
luke_skywalker I didn't hear you give any ideas.
not_available Well, anything's better than just hangin' around waiting for 'em to pick us up.
not_available Who do you think What is it?
c3po I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
not_available He says "I've found her" and keeps repeating "She's here." Well, who who has he found?
not_available Princess Leia.
not_available The princess?
not_available She's here?
not_available
not_available !
not_available Princess?
not_available Where?
not_available Where is she?
not_available Princess?
not_available What's going on?
not_available Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.
c3po I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
not_available Oh, no!
luke_skywalker We've got to do something!
not_available What are you talking about?
not_available The droids belong to her.
luke_skywalker She's the one in the message.
not_available We got to help her.
han_solo Now look, don't get any funny ideas.
han_solo The old man wants us to wait right here.
luke_skywalker But he didn't know she was here.
not_available Just find a way back into that detention block.
han_solo I'm not going anywhere.
luke_skywalker They're going to execute her.
luke_skywalker Look, a few minutes ago, you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.
luke_skywalker Now all you want to do is stay?
han_solo Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
not_available But they're gonna kill her!
han_solo Better her than me.
luke_skywalker She's rich.
not_available Argh!
not_available Rich?
not_available Mm-hmm.
luke_skywalker Rich, powerful.
not_available Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be What?
not_available Well, more well than you can imagine.
not_available I don't know.
han_solo I can imagine quite a bit.
luke_skywalker You'll get it.
han_solo I better.
not_available You will.
han_solo All right, kid.
not_available You better be right about this.
not_available All right.
han_solo What's your plan?
not_available Um 3 PO, hand me those binders there, will you?
not_available O.K.
not_available Now I'm gonna put these on you.
not_available Grrr!
not_available O.K.
not_available Han, you you put those on.
han_solo Don't worry, Chewie.
han_solo I think I know what he has in mind.
not_available Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking, but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?
not_available Lock the door.
han_solo And hope they don't have blasters.
c3po That isn't very reassuring.
not_available Grrr!
not_available 517 to scanner control.
not_available 316, report to control.
not_available 53 to upper bay door.
luke_skywalker I can't see a thing in this helmet.
han_solo This is not gonna work.
luke_skywalker Why didn't you say so before?
han_solo I did say so before.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Where are you taking this thing?
luke_skywalker Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I wasn't notified.
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 I'll have to clear it.
not_available Argh!
han_solo Look out!
han_solo He's loose!
luke_skywalker He'll tear us all apart!
not_available I'll get him!
not_available Look out!
not_available Arrgh!
han_solo We gotta find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
not_available Here it is2187.
not_available You go and get her.
han_solo I'll hold them here.
not_available Uh Uh, everything's under control.
han_solo Situation normal.
not_available What happened?
not_available Had a slight weapons malfunction, but, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.
not_available We're fineWe're all fine here now.
not_available Thank you.
han_solo How are you?
INTERCOM_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We're sending a squad up.
not_available Uh, negative, negative!
not_available We have aa reactor leak here, uh, now.
han_solo Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
not_available Uh, large leak, very dangerous.
INTERCOM_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Who is this?
INTERCOM_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 What's your operating number?
not_available Uh Boring conversation anyway.
not_available Luke!
not_available We're gonna have company!
not_available Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
han_solo Huh?
luke_skywalker Oh, the uniform.
luke_skywalker I'm Luke Skywalker.
luke_skywalker I'm here to rescue you.
princess_leia You're who?
luke_skywalker I'm here to rescue you.
luke_skywalker I've got your R2 unit.
luke_skywalker I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
not_available Ben Kenobi?
not_available
not_available !
not_available Where is he?
not_available Come on!
darth_vader He is here.
not_available Obi-Wan Kenobi?
grand_moff_tarkin What makes you think so?
darth_vader A tremor in the Force.
darth_vader The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
grand_moff_tarkin Surely he must be dead by now.
not_available Don't underestimate the Force.
grand_moff_tarkin The Jedi are extinct.
grand_moff_tarkin Their fire has gone out of the universe.
grand_moff_tarkin You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
not_available Yes.
not_available We have an emergency alert in Detention Block AA-23.
not_available The princess?
grand_moff_tarkin Put all sections on alert.
darth_vader Obi-Wan is here.
darth_vader The Force is with him.
grand_moff_tarkin If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
darth_vader Escape is not his plan.
darth_vader I must face him alone.
not_available Argh!
han_solo Get behind me!
han_solo Get behind me!
not_available Watch your left.
not_available They went down the cell bay.
han_solo Can't get out that way.
princess_leia Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
han_solo Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.
not_available C-3PO, C-3PO!
not_available Yes, sir?
luke_skywalker Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?
luke_skywalker We've been cut off!
not_available What was that?
luke_skywalker I didn't copy.

not_available No, wait!
luke_skywalker Will you forget it?

han_solo Absolutely, Your Worship.
not_available Look, I had everything under control till you led us down here!
not_available Ya know, it's not gonna take 'em long to figure out what happened to us!
princess_leia It could be worse.
not_available Woorr!
han_solo It's worse.
luke_skywalker There's something alive in here.
han_solo That's your imagination.
not_available Something just moved past my leg.

princess_leia Luke, Luke!
princess_leia Help him!
not_available What happened?
not_available I don't know.
luke_skywalker Itjust let go of me and disappeared.
not_available I got a bad feeling about this.
not_available Grrr!
luke_skywalker The walls are moving!
princess_leia Don't just stand there!
not_available Try and brace it with something.
not_available Grrr!
princess_leia Help me!
not_available Wait a minute!

c3po They're madmen.
c3po They're heading for the prison level.
c3po If you hurry, you might catch them.
FIRST_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Follow me.
FIRST_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 You stand guard.
not_available Come on.
not_available Oh!
not_available All this excitement has overrun the circuits in my counterpart here.

not_available I'm trying.
c3po Thank goodness they haven't found them.
c3po Where could they be?
c3po "Use the comlink"?
c3po Oh, my.
c3po I forgot.

not_available Ha ha!
c3po Listen to them.
not_available They're dying, R2!
c3po Curse my metal body!
c3po I wasn't fast enough.
c3po It's all my fault!
c3po My poor master.
luke_skywalker We're all right!
luke_skywalker You did great!
not_available Hey!
luke_skywalker Open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number Where are we?
not_available 3263827!
not_available If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get outta here.
luke_skywalker Well, let's get moving.
not_available Grrr!

not_available Aw No, wait!
princess_leia They'll hear!
han_solo Come here, you big coward.

not_available Listen I don't know who you are or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you, O.
not_available K?
han_solo Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight.
not_available I take orders from just one personme.
princess_leia It's a wonder you're still alive.
princess_leia Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
han_solo No reward is worth this.
not_available Give me regular reports, please.
not_available Right.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Do you know what's going on?
SECOND_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Maybe it's another drill.
not_available You seen that new VT-16?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Some of the other guys were telling me about it.
not_available They say it's it's quite a thing to see- What was that?
not_available Ah, it's nothing.
not_available Outgassing.
not_available Don't worry about it.
not_available There she is.
not_available C-3PO?
not_available Do you copy?
not_available Yes, sir.
not_available Are you safe?
c3po For the moment.
c3po We're in the main hangar across from the ship.
not_available We're right above you.
not_available Stand by.
princess_leia You came in that thing?
not_available You're braver than I thought.
han_solo Nice!
not_available Come on.
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 It's them!
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Blast them!
han_solo Get back to the ship!
not_available Where are you going?
not_available Come back!
princess_leia He certainly has courage.
luke_skywalker What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?
not_available Come on.
rebel#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Aah!
not_available Whoop!
luke_skywalker I think we took a wrong turn.
princess_leia There's no lock.
not_available That oughta hold them for a while.
not_available Quick!
princess_leia We've got to get across.
not_available Find the controls that extend the bridge.
luke_skywalker I think I just blasted it.
princess_leia They're coming through!
luke_skywalker Here, hold this.
princess_leia Here they come.
princess_leia For luck.
not_available We think they may be splitting up.
not_available They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Close the blast doors!
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Open the blast doors!
clone_trooper#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Open the blast doors!
darth_vader I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
darth_vader We meet again at last.
darth_vader The circle is now complete.
darth_vader When I left you, I was but the learner.
not_available Now / am the master.
obiwan_kenobi Only a master of evil, Darth.
darth_vader Your powers are weak, old man.
obiwan_kenobi You can't win, Darth.
obiwan_kenobi If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
not_available You should not have come back.
han_solo Didn't we just leave this party?
han_solo What kept you?
not_available We, uh, ran into some old friends.
luke_skywalker The ship all right?
not_available It seems O.K., if we can get to it.
not_available I just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.
not_available Look!
not_available Come on, R2, we're going.
han_solo Now's our chance!
not_available Go!
not_available Ben?
not_available No!
not_available Come on!
princess_leia Luke, it's too late!
not_available Blast the door, kid!
not_available Obi-Wan Run, Luke, run!
not_available I hope that old man got that tractor beam out of commission, or this is gonna be a real short trip.
not_available O.K.
not_available Hit it!
not_available Aargh!
not_available We're coming up on their sentry ships.
not_available Hold them off.
han_solo Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns.
luke_skywalker I can't believe he's gone.
princess_leia There wasn't anything you could have done.
han_solo Come on, buddy.
han_solo We're not out of this yet.
han_solo You in, kid?
not_available O.K., stay sharp.
princess_leia Here they come.
luke_skywalker They're coming in too fast!
not_available We've lost the lateral controls!
not_available Don't worry.
han_solo She'll hold together.
han_solo Hear me, baby?
han_solo Hold together.
not_available Ha ha!
luke_skywalker Got him!
luke_skywalker I got him!
han_solo Great, kid!
han_solo Don't get cocky.
not_available There's still two more of them out there!
luke_skywalker That's it!
not_available We did it!
not_available We did it!
not_available Help!
c3po I think I'm melting!
not_available This is all your fault!
grand_moff_tarkin Are they away?
not_available They've just made the jump into hyperspace.
grand_moff_tarkin You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?
grand_moff_tarkin I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.
grand_moff_tarkin This had better work.
han_solo Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
not_available You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.
princess_leia That doesn't sound too hard.
princess_leia They let us go.
princess_leia It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
not_available Easy?
han_solo You call that easy?
not_available They're tracking us.
han_solo Not this ship, sister.
not_available At least the information in R2 is still intact.
han_solo What's so important?
han_solo What's he carrying?
princess_leia The technical readouts of that battle station.
not_available I only hope that when the data's analyzed, a weakness can be found.
princess_leia It's not over yet.
han_solo It is for me, sister.
han_solo Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.
han_solo I expect to be well paid.
han_solo I'm in it for the money.
princess_leia You needn't worry about your reward.
princess_leia If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive.
princess_leia Your friend is quite a mercenary.
not_available I wonder if he really cares about anything or anybody.
luke_skywalker I care.
luke_skywalker So what do you think of her, Han?
han_solo I'm trying not to, kid.
not_available Good.
han_solo Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
not_available I don't know.
not_available What do you think?
not_available You think a princess and a guy like me- No!
general_willard You're safe.
not_available When we heard about Alderaan, we feared the worst.
not_available We have no time for sorrows, Commander.
not_available You must use the information in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.
not_available It's our only hope.
not_available Yes.
not_available We're approaching the planet Yavin.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 The rebel base is on a moon on the far side.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 We are preparing to orbit the planet.
general_dodonna The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the starfleet.
general_dodonna Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.
general_dodonna A small, one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?
general_dodonna The Empire doesn't consider a small, one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.
general_dodonna An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
general_dodonna The approach will not be easy.
not_available You're required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.
not_available The target area is only 2 meters wide.
general_dodonna It's a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port.
general_dodonna The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.
general_dodonna A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.
general_dodonna Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.
general_dodonna The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
red_two That's impossible, even for a computer.
luke_skywalker It's not impossible.
not_available I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-16 back home.
not_available They're not much bigger than 2 meters.
not_available Then man your ships, and may the Force be with you.
voice_over_death_star_intercom#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.
not_available The moon with the rebel base will be in range in 30 minutes.
darth_vader This will be a day long remembered.
not_available It has seen the end of Kenobi and will soon see the end of the rebellion.
not_available All flight crews, man your stations.
luke_skywalker So you got your reward and you're just leaving, then?
han_solo That's right.
not_available Yeah.
not_available I got some old debts I got to pay off with this stuff.
not_available And even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do ya?
han_solo Why don't you come with us?
han_solo You're pretty good in a fight.
not_available We could use ya.
not_available Come on.
luke_skywalker Why don't you take a look around?
luke_skywalker You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.
luke_skywalker They could use a good pilot like you.
luke_skywalker You're turning your back on them.
han_solo What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
han_solo Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.
han_solo It's more like suicide.
not_available All right.
luke_skywalker Take care of yourself, Han.
luke_skywalker I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
han_solo Hey, Luke.
not_available May the Force be with you.
not_available Argh!
not_available What are you looking at?
han_solo I know what I'm doing.
not_available All pilots to your stations.
not_available What's wrong?
luke_skywalker Oh, it's Han.
not_available I don't know.
luke_skywalker I really thought he'd change his mind.
princess_leia He's got to follow his own path.
princess_leia No one can choose it for him.
luke_skywalker I only wish Ben were here.
not_available Open main launch tubes.
not_available Main launch tubes opening, sir.
han_solo Hey, Luke!
not_available Biggs!
red_three_ I don't believe it.
han_solo How are you?
not_available Great.
not_available Hey, coming up?
not_available I'll be right up there with you, and have I got stories to tell you.
not_available Are you sure you can handle this ship?
red_three_ Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot in the outer-rim territories.
red_leader You'll do all right.
luke_skywalker Thank you, sir.
luke_skywalker I'll try.
not_available I gotta get aboard.
not_available We'll hear all your stories when we get back, all right?
not_available All right.
not_available Hey, Biggs.
luke_skywalker I told you I'd make it someday.
not_available It'll be like old times, Luke.
not_available They'll never stop us.
not_available Hey, this R2 unit of yours seems a bit beat up.
chief#unknown#StarWars.Episode04 You want a new one?
luke_skywalker Not on your life.
luke_skywalker That little droid and I have been through a lot together.
not_available You O.K., R2?
not_available Good.
not_available Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.
not_available Hang on tight, R2.
c3po You've got to come back.

luke_skywalker Are you all right?
luke_skywalker I got a little cooked, but I'm O.K.
not_available We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader, but they're so small, they're evading our turbolasers.
darth_vader We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.
darth_vader Get the crews to their fighters.
not_available Watch yourself.
red_leader There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.
luke_skywalker I'm on it.
luke_skywalker I'm going in.

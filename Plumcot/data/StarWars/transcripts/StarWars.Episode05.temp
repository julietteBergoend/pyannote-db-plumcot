luke_skywalker Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me?
han_solo Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
luke_skywalker Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.
han_solo There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed, I'm going back.
luke_skywalker Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.
luke_skywalker Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?
luke_skywalker Aaargh!
han_solo Chewie!
han_solo All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand.
rebel_force_general_rieekan Solo?
han_solo No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place. You'll know if anything comes around.
rebel_force_general_rieekan Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
han_solo No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. rieekan With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships. Taking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind. han General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore. Princess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short white combat jacket and pants. Her hair is braided across her head in a Nordic fashion. She overhears their conversation and seems somewhat distressed. rieekan I'm sorry to hear that. han Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man. rieekan A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you. han Thank you, General. He turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away.
han_solo Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.
princess_leia That's right.
han_solo Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.
princess_leia Han!
han_solo Yes, Your Highnessness?
princess_leia I thought you decided to stay.
han_solo Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
princess_leia Han, we need you!
han_solo We?
princess_leia Yes.
han_solo Oh, what about you need?
princess_leia I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
han_solo You probably don't.
princess_leia And what precisely am I supposed to know?
han_solo Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
princess_leia Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
han_solo No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on.
princess_leia You're imagining things.
han_solo Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
princess_leia I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
han_solo I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!
c3po Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess' chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.
r2d2 beeps
c3po Oh, switch off.
han_solo Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these.
chewbacca grumbles
c3po Excuse me, sir.
han_solo Put them back together right now.
c3po Might I have a word with you, please?
han_solo What do you want?
c3po Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator.
han_solo I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
c3po Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.
han_solo I don't know where he is.
c3po Nobody knows where he is.
han_solo What do you mean, "nobody knows"?
c3po Well, uh, you see...
han_solo Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
c3po Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu...
han_solo abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer approaches.
rebel_force_deck_lieutenant officer Yes, sir?
han_solo Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
rebel_force_deck_lieutenant officer I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance.
han_solo It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there.
rebel_force_deck_lieutenant officer Yes, sir.
c3po Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?
han_solo Why not?
c3po Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.
rebel_force_deck_lieutenant officer Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in.
han_solo Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
rebel_force_deck_lieutenant officer Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold.
han_solo Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
rebel_force_deck_lieutenant officer Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly.
han_solo That's right. And my friends out in it.
assistant#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 officer I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha.
rebel_force_deck_lieutenant officer Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker.
han_solo Then I'll see you in hell!
c3po You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up.
r2d2 beeps
c3po Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right.
lieutenant#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.
c3po Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.
rebel_force_major_derlin Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed.
rebel_force_major_derlin Close the doors.
lieutenant#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Yes, sir.
c3po Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five... to one.
c3po Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know... for a human being.
ben_kenobi Luke... Luke.
luke_skywalker Ben?
ben_kenobi You will go to the Dagobah system.
luke_skywalker Dagobah system?
ben_kenobi There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.
luke_skywalker Ben... Ben.
han_solo Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here.
han_solo Not much time.
luke_skywalker Ben... Ben...
han_solo Hang on, kid.
luke_skywalker Dagobah system...
han_solo Whew...
luke_skywalker Dagobah...
han_solo This may smell bad, kid...
luke_skywalker Yoda...
han_solo ...but it will keep you warm... til I get the shelter built. Ooh... I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
Four#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape.
rebel_force_zev_ Echo Base... I've got something! Not much, but it could be a life form.
rebel_force_zev_ This is Rogue Two. this is Rogue Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue Two.
han_solo Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.
rebel_force_zev_ Echo Base... this is Rogue Two. I found them. Repeat, I found them.
c3po Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again.
r2d2 beeps
c3po Artoo expresses his relief, also.
han_solo How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.
luke_skywalker Thanks to you.
han_solo That's two you owe me, junior.
han_solo Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.
princess_leia I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
han_solo That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
princess_leia I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain.
han_solo Laugh it up, fuzzball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage.
han_solo She expressed her true feelings for me.
princess_leia My...! Why, you stuck up,... half-witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-herder!
han_solo Who's scruffy-looking? I must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
princess_leia Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?
announcer#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Headquarters personnel, report to command center.
han_solo Take it easy.
c3po Excuse us, please.
rebel_force_general_rieekan Princess... we have a visitor.
rebel_force_general_rieekan We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east.
senior_controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 It's metal.
princess_leia Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
han_solo It could be a speeder, one of ours.
senior_controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 No. Wait - there's something very weak coming through.
c3po Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.
han_solo It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.
rebel_force_general_rieekan Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.
han_solo Afraid there's not much left.
princess_leia What was it?
han_solo Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.
princess_leia An Imperial probe droid.
han_solo It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
rebel_force_general_rieekan We'd better start the evacuation.
darth_vader Vader's Star Destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of space. The six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller spacecraft. TIE fighters dart to and fro.
Controllers#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 working the vast complex of electronic controls hear ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls. The squat, evil-looking Admiral Ozzel and the young, powerfully built General Veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the approaching presence and turn toward it. Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith, enters like a chill wind. As Vader moves across the wide bridge, Captain Piett hurries up to Ozzel.
admiral_piett Admiral.
admiral_ozzel Yes, Captain
admiral_piett I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had.
admiral_ozzel We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads!
admiral_piett The visuals indicate life readings.
admiral_ozzel It could mean anything. If we followed every lead...
admiral_piett But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms.
darth_vader You found something?
admiral_piett Yes, my lord.
darth_vader That's it. The Rebels are there.
admiral_ozzel My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be...
darth_vader That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men.
rebel#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 captain Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch.
rebel#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 fighter Right, sir.
han_solo Okay, that's it. Try it... Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off!
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.
luke_skywalker Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports.
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Take care, sir.
luke_skywalker Thanks.
luke_skywalker Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?
han_solo Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right?
luke_skywalker Yeah.
han_solo Be careful.
luke_skywalker You, too.
controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four.
rebel_force_general_rieekan Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.
darth_vader What is it, General?
general_veers My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.
darth_vader The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system.
general_veers He felt surprise was wiser...
darth_vader He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.
general_veers Yes, my lord.
admiral_ozzel Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to... Aaagh!
darth_vader You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett.
admiral_piett Yes, my lord.
darth_vader Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett.
admiral_piett Thank you, Lord Vader.
princess_leia All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports.
rebel_force_hobbie_ Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?
princess_leia The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?
pilots#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Right. Okay.
princess_leia Good luck.
rebel_force_major_derlin Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!
rebel_force_general_rieekan Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield.
controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector.
captain_raymus_antilles Good. Our first catch of the day.
woman_controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Stand by, ion control... Fire!
announcer#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 The first transport is away.
rebel_force_deck_lieutenant Feeling all right, sir?
luke_skywalker Just like new, Dack. How about you?
rebel_force_deck_lieutenant Right now I feel like I could take on the whole Empire myself.
luke_skywalker I know what you mean.
trench_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Echo Station Three-T-Eight.
trench_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 We have spotted Imperial walkers!
controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Imperial walkers on the north ridge.
luke_skywalker Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.
luke_skywalker All right, boys, keep tight now.
rebel_force_deck_lieutenant Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.
luke_skywalker Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!
luke_skywalker All right, I'm coming in.
luke_skywalker Hobbie, you still with me?
luke_skywalker That armor's too strong for blasters.
luke_skywalker Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack.
rebel_force_deck_lieutenant Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.
luke_skywalker Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable.
After#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 sustaining a heavy volley of fire, Luke turns around to see if Dack is all right.
luke_skywalker Dack? Dack!
general_veers Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing.
luke_skywalker Rogue Three.
red_two_ Copy, Rogue Leader
luke_skywalker Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.
red_two_ Coming around, Rogue Leader.
luke_skywalker Steady, Rogue Two
red_two_ Activate harpoon.
red_two_ Good shot, Janson.
red_two_ One more pass.
rebel_force_janson_ Coming around. Once more.
rebel_force_janson_ Once more.
rebel_force_janson_ Cable out! Let her go!
red_two_ Detach cable.
rebel_force_janson_ Cable detached.
trench_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Come on!
red_two_ Whooha! That got him!
luke_skywalker I see it, Wedge. Good work.
rebel_force_general_rieekan I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.
princess_leia It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice.
rebel_force_general_rieekan Launch patrols.
princess_leia Evacuate remaining ground staff.
han_solo No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. Right?
c3po Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And ... do take good care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.
general_veers All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator.
luke_skywalker Rogue Two, are you all right?
rebel_force_zev_ Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.
luke_skywalker We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you.
rebel_force_zev_ Coming around.
luke_skywalker Watch that cross fire, boys.
rebel_force_zev_ Set for position three. Steady.
luke_skywalker Stay tight and low.
luke_skywalker Hobbie, I've been hit!
han_solo You all right?
princess_leia nods. She is surprised to see him.
princess_leia Why are you still here?
han_solo I heard the command center had been hit.
princess_leia You got your clearance to leave.
han_solo Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
c3po Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope.
princess_leia Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters.
announcer#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Imperial troops have entered the base.
han_solo Come on... that's it.
princess_leia Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports!
HEAD#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 controller K-one-zero... all troops disengage.
c3po Oh! Wait for me!
officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Begin retreat!
second_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Fall back!
general_veers Distance to power generators?
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 One-seven, decimal two-eight.
general_veers Target. Maximum fire power.
han_solo Transport, this is Solo. Better take off - I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon.
c3po But... but... but... where are you going? Uh... come back!!
c3po Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!
c3po How typical.
han_solo Come on.
han_solo Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!
c3po Wait! Wait!
han_solo How's this?
princess_leia Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
han_solo It might.
c3po Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir, might I suggest that you...
c3po It can wait.
princess_leia This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
han_solo This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.
The#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon, are hit by the Falcon's fire and are thrown about in all directions.
han_solo Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout.
han_solo See?
princess_leia Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it.
han_solo Punch it!
luke_skywalker Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.
red_two_ Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.
luke_skywalker Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going.
The#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 canopy over the X-wing lowers and snaps shut.
luke_skywalker There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course.
r2d2 beeps
luke_skywalker We're not going to regroup with the others.
luke_skywalker We're going to the Dagobah system.
luke_skywalker Yes, Artoo?
luke_skywalker That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.
han_solo I saw them! I saw them!
princess_leia Saw what?
han_solo Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.
c3po Sir, sir! Might I suggest...
han_solo Shut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield!
han_solo Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.
imperial_officer Take evasive action!
han_solo Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.
c3po But, sir!
princess_leia They're getting closer!
han_solo Oh yeah? Watch this.
princess_leia Watch what?
han_solo I think we're in trouble.
c3po If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!
han_solo We're in trouble!
han_solo Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners!
han_solo I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.
han_solo Oww! Chewie!
han_solo That was no laser blast! Something hit us.
princess_leia Han, get up here!
han_solo Come on, Chewie!
princess_leia Asteroids!
han_solo Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.
princess_leia What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?
han_solo They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?
princess_leia You don't have to do this to impress me.
c3po Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.
han_solo Never tell me the odds!
han_solo You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart.
princess_leia I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
han_solo I'm not going to argue with that.
c3po Pulverized?
han_solo I'm going in closer to one of those big ones.
princess_leia Closer?
c3po Closer?!
c3po Oh, this is suicide!
han_solo There. That looks pretty good.
princess_leia What looks pretty good?
han_solo Yeah. That'll do nicely.
c3po Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?
princess_leia I hope you know what you're doing.
han_solo Yeah, me too.
luke_skywalker Yes, that's it. Dagobah.
r2d2 beeps
luke_skywalker No, I'm not going to change my mind about this. I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there...
r2d2 beeps
luke_skywalker Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.
luke_skywalker I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle...
luke_skywalker No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around.
luke_skywalker Artoo?
luke_skywalker Artoo! Where are you?
luke_skywalker Artoo! You be more careful.
luke_skywalker Artoo - that way!
luke_skywalker Artoo!
luke_skywalker Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken?
luke_skywalker If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy.
darth_vader Yes, Admiral?
admiral_piett Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But... it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk...
darth_vader Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses.
admiral_piett Yes, lord.
han_solo I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.
c3po Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but... does that include shutting me down, too?
han_solo No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
c3po Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
han_solo Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.
c3po Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...
princess_leia Let go.
han_solo Sshh!
princess_leia Let go, please.
han_solo Don't get excited.
princess_leia Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.
han_solo Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.
The#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking swamp.
luke_skywalker Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go.
luke_skywalker Now all I have to do is find this Yoda... if he even exists.
luke_skywalker Still... there's something familiar about this place. I feel like... I don't know...
strange#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 voice Feel like what?
luke_skywalker Like we're being watched!
snow_creature Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm.
snow_creature I am wondering, why are you here?
luke_skywalker I'm looking for someone.
snow_creature Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?
luke_skywalker Right.
snow_creature Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.
luke_skywalker I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
snow_creature Ahhh! A great warrior. Wars not make one great.
luke_skywalker Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner!
snow_creature How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
luke_skywalker Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...
snow_creature Aww, cannot get your ship out?
luke_skywalker Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh... you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!
snow_creature Mine! Or I will help you not.
luke_skywalker I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
snow_creature Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.
r2d2 beeps
snow_creature Ah, ah, ah!
luke_skywalker Oh, Artoo, let him have it!
snow_creature Mine! Mine!
luke_skywalker Artoo!
snow_creature Mine!
snow_creature Mine!
luke_skywalker Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do.
snow_creature No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm?
luke_skywalker I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
snow_creature Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.
luke_skywalker You know him?
snow_creature Mmm. Take you to him, I will. Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come.
snow_creature Come, come.
luke_skywalker Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.
r2d2 beeps
c3po Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?
c3po Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
han_solo Well, of course I'll have to replace it.
han_solo Here! And Chewie...
han_solo ... I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.
han_solo Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.
princess_leia Would you please stop calling me that?
han_solo Sure, Leia.
princess_leia Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.
han_solo I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.
princess_leia Occasionally... ... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
han_solo Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
princess_leia Stop that.
han_solo Stop what?
princess_leia Stop that! My hands are dirty.
han_solo My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?
princess_leia Afraid?
han_solo You're trembling.
princess_leia I'm not trembling.
han_solo You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
princess_leia I happen to like nice men.
han_solo I'm a nice man.
princess_leia No, you're not. You're...
c3po Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
han_solo Thank you. Thank you very much.
c3po Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.
captain_needa ... and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed.
darth_vader No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.
admiral_piett Lord Vader.
darth_vader Yes, Admiral, what is it?
admiral_piett The Emperor commands you make contact with him.
darth_vader Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission.
admiral_piett Yes, my lord.
darth_vader What is thy bidding, my master?
emperor There is a great disturbance in the Force.
darth_vader I have felt it.
emperor We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker.
darth_vader Yes, my master.
emperor He could destroy us.
darth_vader He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
emperor The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.
darth_vader If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.
emperor Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?
darth_vader He will join us or die, my master.
darth_vader kneels. The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Lord of the Sith and fades away.
luke_skywalker Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.
snow_creature Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?
luke_skywalker How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
snow_creature Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?
luke_skywalker Mostly because of my father, I guess.
snow_creature Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.
luke_skywalker Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. Oh, I don't know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time.
snow_creature I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
ben_kenobi VOICE He will learn patience.
yoda Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.
ben_kenobi VOICE Was I any different when you taught me?
yoda Hah. He is not ready.
luke_skywalker Yoda! I am ready. I... Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.
yoda Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!
ben_kenobi VOICE So was I, if you'll remember.
yoda He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.
luke_skywalker But I've learned so much.
yoda Will he finished what he begins?
luke_skywalker I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.
yoda Oh, you will be. You will be.
c3po Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
han_solo I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.
princess_leia There's something out there.
han_solo Where?
princess_leia Outside, in the cave.
c3po There it is. Listen! Listen!
han_solo I'm going out there.
princess_leia Are you crazy?!
han_solo I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart.
princess_leia Then I'm going with you.
c3po I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no.
princess_leia This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all.
han_solo There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
princess_leia I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
han_solo Yeah.
han_solo Watch out!
han_solo Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.
princess_leia Mynocks?
han_solo Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
c3po Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly little thing. Shoo! Shoo!
han_solo Wait a minute...
chewbacca barks
han_solo All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!
princess_leia The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
han_solo No time to discuss this in committee.
princess_leia I am not a committee!
princess_leia You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...
han_solo Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!
c3po Look!
han_solo I see it, I see it.
c3po We're doomed!
princess_leia The cave is collapsing.
han_solo This is no cave.
princess_leia What?
yoda Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger... fear... aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
luke_skywalker Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
yoda No... no... no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
luke_skywalker But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
yoda You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
luke_skywalker But tell me why I can't...
yoda No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmmmm.
luke_skywalker There's something not right here.
luke_skywalker I feel cold, death.
yoda That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
luke_skywalker What's in there?
yoda Only what you take with you.
yoda Your weapons... you will not need them.
admiral_piett Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum.
first_controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Yes, sir.
admiral_piett Those Rebels won't escape us.
second_controller#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger.
admiral_piett Right.
darth_vader ... there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations.
boba_fett As you wish.
admiral_piett Lord Vader! My lord, we have them.
c3po Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field.
han_solo Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One... two... three!
han_solo It's not fair!
han_solo The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
princess_leia No light-speed?
han_solo It's not my fault.
c3po Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
han_solo Turn her around.
han_solo I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield.
princess_leia You're going to attack them?!
c3po Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer...
princess_leia Shut up!
captain_needa They're moving to attack position! Shields up!
captain_needa Track them. They may come around for another pass.
tracking_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes.
captain_needa They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device.
tracking_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Well, there's no trace of them, sir.
communications_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit.
captain_needa Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
communications_officer#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Yes, Captain Needa.
yoda Use the Force. Yes...
yoda Now... the stone. Feel it.
yoda Concentrate!
luke_skywalker Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.
yoda So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
luke_skywalker Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different.
yoda No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
luke_skywalker All right, I'll give it a try.
yoda No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
luke_skywalker I can't. It's too big.
yoda Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm.
yoda And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ... not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!
luke_skywalker You want the impossible.
luke_skywalker I don't... I don't believe it.
yoda That is why you fail.
darth_vader Apology accepted, Captain Needa.
admiral_piett Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.
darth_vader Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory.
admiral_piett Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
darth_vader Don't fail me again, Admiral.
admiral_piett Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.
c3po Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
han_solo The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.
c3po I really don't see how that is going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
han_solo Thank you.
princess_leia What did you have in mind for your next move?
han_solo Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.
princess_leia With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
han_solo Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?
princess_leia No. Where are we?
han_solo The Anoat system.
princess_leia Anoat system. There's not much there.
han_solo No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.
princess_leia Lando system?
han_solo Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.
princess_leia Thanks.
han_solo Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.
princess_leia A mining colony?
han_solo Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me.
princess_leia Can you trust him?
han_solo No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that.
han_solo Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!
princess_leia You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.
yoda Concentrate... feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future... the past. Old friends long gone.
luke_skywalker Han! Leia!
yoda Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.
luke_skywalker I saw... I saw a city in the clouds.
yoda Mmm. Friends you have there.
luke_skywalker They were in pain.
yoda It is the future you see.
luke_skywalker Future? Will they die?
yoda Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
luke_skywalker I've got to go to them.
yoda Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
han_solo No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.
han_solo Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.
intercom_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 You will not deviate from your present course.
c3po Rather touchy, aren't they?
princess_leia I thought you knew this person.
han_solo Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
intercom_voice#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven.
han_solo Thank you.
han_solo There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.
princess_leia doesn't look convinced.
princess_leia Who's worried?
c3po Oh. No one to meet us.
princess_leia I don't like this.
han_solo Well, what would you like?
c3po Well, they did let us land.
han_solo Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.
han_solo See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay?
lando_calrissian Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled.
lando_calrissian How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! I never thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?
c3po Well, he seems very friendly.
princess_leia Yes... very friendly.
lando_calrissian What are you doing here?
han_solo Ahh... repairs. I thought you could help me out.
lando_calrissian What have you done to my ship?
han_solo Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.
lando_calrissian Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. And who might you be?
princess_leia Leia.
lando_calrissian Welcome, Leia.
han_solo All right, all right, you old smoothie.
c3po Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your...
c3po Well, really!
lando_calrissian What's wrong with the Falcon?
han_solo Hyperdrive.
lando_calrissian I'll get my people to work on it.
han_solo Good.
lando_calrissian You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.
han_solo How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?
lando_calrissian Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?
han_solo You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?
lando_calrissian You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.
han_solo Yeah.
lando_calrissian Yeah. I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.
c3po Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.
second_threepio#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 E chu ta!
c3po How rude!
c3po That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...
c3po Hello? How interesting. Oh, my.
c3po Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I... I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!
yoda Luke! You must complete the training.
luke_skywalker I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them.
yoda You must not go!
luke_skywalker But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
ben_kenobi VOICE You don't know that.
ben_kenobi Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
luke_skywalker But I can help them! I feel the Force!
ben_kenobi But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.
yoda Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!
luke_skywalker But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.
ben_kenobi It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer.
luke_skywalker And that is why I have to go.
ben_kenobi Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.
luke_skywalker You won't.
yoda Stopped they must be. On this all depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.
ben_kenobi Patience.
luke_skywalker And sacrifice Han and Leia?
yoda If you honor what they fight for ... yes!
ben_kenobi If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere.
luke_skywalker I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters.
ben_kenobi Luke, don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side.
yoda Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
luke_skywalker I will. And I'll return. I promise.
yoda Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.
ben_kenobi That boy is our last hope.
yoda No. There is another.
han_solo The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape.
princess_leia The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
han_solo Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
princess_leia I don't trust Lando.
han_solo Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone.
princess_leia And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?
princess_leia What happened?
han_solo Where? Found him in a junk pile?
princess_leia Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
han_solo Lando's got people who can fix him.
princess_leia No, thanks.
lando_calrissian I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?
princess_leia Not really.
lando_calrissian You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds.
princess_leia Thank you.
lando_calrissian Will you join me for a little refreshment?
lando_calrissian Everyone's invited, of course.
lando_calrissian Having trouble with you droid?
han_solo No. No problem. Why?
lando_calrissian So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the... uh... jurisdiction of the Empire.
princess_leia So you're part of the mining guild then?
lando_calrissian No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.
han_solo Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?
lando_calrissian That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.
darth_vader We would be honored if you would join us.
lando_calrissian I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.
han_solo I'm sorry, too.
luke_skywalker No, Threepio's with them.
luke_skywalker Just hang on. We're almost there.
c3po Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no... Please don't get up. No!
c3po Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!
lando_calrissian Lord Vader.
darth_vader You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker.
boba_fett He's no good to me dead.
darth_vader He will not be permanently damaged.
lando_calrissian Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?
darth_vader They must never again leave this city.
lando_calrissian That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!
darth_vader Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
lando_calrissian No.
darth_vader Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.
lando_calrissian This deal's getting worse all the time.
c3po Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...
han_solo I feel terrible.
princess_leia Why are they doing this?
han_solo They never even asked me any questions.
princess_leia Lando.
han_solo Get out of here, Lando!
lando_calrissian Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
han_solo Over to you?
lando_calrissian They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
princess_leia What about Han?
lando_calrissian Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.
princess_leia Vader wants us all dead.
lando_calrissian He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.
han_solo Luke?
lando_calrissian Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
princess_leia And we're the bait.
lando_calrissian Well, he's on his way.
han_solo Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? My friend!
lando_calrissian Stop! I've done all I can. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems.
han_solo Yeah, you're a real hero.
princess_leia You certainly have a way with people.
darth_vader This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.
imperial#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 soldier Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class.
darth_vader Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.
lando_calrissian Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him.
darth_vader I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it... on Captain Solo.
c3po If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.
han_solo What's going on... buddy?
lando_calrissian You're being put into carbon freeze.
boba_fett What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.
darth_vader The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!
c3po Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!
han_solo Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!
c3po Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.
han_solo Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!
han_solo Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me?
princess_leia I love you!
han_solo I know.
c3po What... what's going on? Turn round, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh... they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is.
darth_vader Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
lando_calrissian Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.
darth_vader He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
imperial_officer Skywalker has just landed, my lord.
darth_vader Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.
lando_calrissian You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.
darth_vader I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
boba_fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the floating, encased body of Han Solo. Two stormtroopers, who follow, immediately spot Luke and open fire on him. The youth draws his weapon and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot. The two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a huge chunk of wall.
princess_leia Luke! Luke, don't - it's a trap! It's a trap!
darth_vader The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet.
lando_calrissian Well done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move.
princess_leia What do you think you're doing?
lando_calrissian We're getting out of here.
c3po I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
princess_leia Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you?
lando_calrissian I had no choice...
c3po What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!
princess_leia Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.
lando_calrissian I'm just trying to help...
princess_leia We don't need any of your help.
lando_calrissian H-a-a-a...
princess_leia What?
c3po It sounds like Han.
lando_calrissian There's still a chance to save Han... I mean, at the East Platform...
princess_leia Chewie.
c3po I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.
boba_fett Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.
c3po Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?
c3po Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!
c3po Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me!
chewbacca howls
c3po Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!
darth_vader You have learned much, young one.
luke_skywalker You'll find I'm full of surprises.
darth_vader Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
luke_skywalker No!
darth_vader All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought.
darth_vader Impressive... most impressive.
darth_vader Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger.
darth_vader Only your hatred can destroy me.
lando_calrissian The security codes has been changed!
c3po Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system.
lando_calrissian Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.
lando_calrissian This way.
c3po Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.
c3po What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.
c3po I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!
c3po Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt. Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!
lando_calrissian Leia! Go!
c3po I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.
darth_vader You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.
darth_vader There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover your power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.
luke_skywalker I'll never join you!
darth_vader If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
luke_skywalker He told me enough! It was you who killed him.
darth_vader No. I am your father.
luke_skywalker No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!
darth_vader Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
luke_skywalker No! No! No!
darth_vader Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It is the only way.
luke_skywalker Ben... Ben, please!
luke_skywalker Ben. Leia!
luke_skywalker Hear me! Leia!
princess_leia Luke... We've got to go back.
lando_calrissian What?
princess_leia I know where Luke is.
lando_calrissian But what about those fighter?
chewbacca barks
princess_leia Chewie, just do it.
lando_calrissian But what about Vader?
lando_calrissian All right, all right, all right.
darth_vader Bring my shuttle.
lando_calrissian Look, someone's up there.
princess_leia It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch.
princess_leia Okay. Easy, Chewie.
princess_leia Lando?
lando_calrissian Okay, let's go.
luke_skywalker Oh, Leia.
lando_calrissian All right, Chewie. Let's go.
The#unknown#StarWars.Episode05 Falcon, still followed by the three TIE fighters, races away from the cloud-covered city.
princess_leia I'll be back.
princess_leia Star Destroyer.
lando_calrissian All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed.
princess_leia If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
princess_leia All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.
lando_calrissian Punch it!
lando_calrissian They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault!
admiral_piett They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, my lord.
darth_vader Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon?
admiral_piett Yes, my lord.
darth_vader Good. Prepare the boarding party and set your weapons for stun.
admiral_piett Yes, my lord.
c3po Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed?
c3po We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?
c3po The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!
darth_vader Luke.
luke_skywalker Father.
darth_vader Son, come with me.
luke_skywalker Ben, why didn't you tell me?
lando_calrissian Chewie!
luke_skywalker It's Vader.
darth_vader Luke... it is your destiny.
luke_skywalker Ben, why didn't you tell me?
admiral_piett Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam.
c3po Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!
c3po Oh, you did it!
lando_calrissian Luke, we're ready for takeoff.
luke_skywalker Good luck, Lando
lando_calrissian When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.
luke_skywalker speaking into the comlink as a medical droid works on his hand. Leia stands near him while Threepio and Artoo look out the window.
luke_skywalker I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.
lando_calrissian Princess, we'll find Han. I promise.
luke_skywalker Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.
luke_skywalker Take care, you two. May the Force be with you.
luke_skywalker Ow!

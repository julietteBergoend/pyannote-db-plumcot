anakin_skywalker There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .
obiwan_kenobi Look out, four droids inbound . . .
obiwan_kenobi We've got to split them up.
anakin_skywalker Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.
obiwan_kenobi Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?
anakin_skywalker Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, they're all over me!
anakin_skywalker Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . . We got him, Artoo!
anakin_skywalker I copy, Artoo.
obiwan_kenobi I'm going down on the deck.
anakin_skywalker Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver. Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!
obiwan_kenobi Hurry up! I don't like this! Ouch! Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.
anakin_skywalker We're locked on ... we've got him . . . Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.
obiwan_kenobi Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...
anakin_skywalker Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead. The one crawling with vulture droids.
obiwan_kenobi I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.
anakin_skywalker Come on, Master.
obiwan_kenobi Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?
odd_ball#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Copy, Red Leader.
obiwan_kenobi Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .
odd_ball#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.
anakin_skywalker This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.
obiwan_kenobi Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .
anakin_skywalker I'm going head to head. See you.
obiwan_kenobi Take it easy, Anakin.
odd_ball#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I'm on your right, Red Leader.
anakin_skywalker Incoming!!
obiwan_kenobi Five more on the right!
anakin_skywalker Here we go.
obiwan_kenobi I'm going high and right.
anakin_skywalker Hang on. There are four more of them.
obiwan_kenobi Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.
anakin_skywalker I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.
obiwan_kenobi All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.
anakin_skywalker How many back there. Artoo? Three . . . Four . . . that's not good.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, you have four on your tail.
anakin_skywalker I know. I know!
obiwan_kenobi Four more closing from your left.
anakin_skywalker I know. I know!
obiwan_kenobi Break right and go high.
anakin_skywalker I'm going low and left.
obiwan_kenobi He still has much to learn.
anakin_skywalker Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .
obiwan_kenobi Too dangerous. First Jedi rule "Survive."
anakin_skywalker Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.
obiwan_kenobi Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.
obiwan_kenobi You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.
anakin_skywalker Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.
obiwan_kenobi Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.
r2d2 SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."
anakin_skywalker Wrong thought, Artoo.
anakin_skywalker I'm through.
odd_ball#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 There are too many of them.
clone_trooper pilot 2 I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .
anakin_skywalker I'm going to go help them out!
obiwan_kenobi No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!
anakin_skywalker Missiles! Pull up!
obiwan_kenobi They overshot us . . .
anakin_skywalker They're coming around!
obiwan_kenobi All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.
anakin_skywalker Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.
anakin_skywalker We got 'em. Artoo!
obiwan_kenobi Flying is for droids.
obiwan_kenobi I'm hit! Anakin?
anakin_skywalker I see them . . . Buzz Droids.
obiwan_kenobi Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .
obiwan_kenobi Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.
anakin_skywalker Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
obiwan_kenobi The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.
obiwan_kenobi In the name of ...
anakin_skywalker Steady . . . steady . . .
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.
anakin_skywalker I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .
obiwan_kenobi Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.
anakin_skywalker Move to the right.
obiwan_kenobi Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.
anakin_skywalker I'm not leaving without you, Master.
obiwan_kenobi Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.
anakin_skywalker Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!
obiwan_kenobi Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.
anakin_skywalker Yeah, you got him!
obiwan_kenobi Great, Artoo.
anakin_skywalker Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.
obiwan_kenobi Have you noticed the shields are still up?
anakin_skywalker Oh?!? Sorry, Master.
obiwan_kenobi Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.
obiwan_kenobi Artoo, locate the Chancellor.
anakin_skywalker Tap into the ship's computers.
obiwan_kenobi The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.
anakin_skywalker I sense Count Dooku . . .
obiwan_kenobi I sense a trap.
anakin_skywalker Next move?
obiwan_kenobi Spring the trap.
anakin_skywalker Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.
obiwan_kenobi Here, take this, and wait for orders.
general_grievous What's the situation, Captain?
captain_raymus_antilles TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
general_grievous Just as Count Dooku predicted.
naboo_royal_security_guard i General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.
obiwan_kenobi We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin. . .
anakin_skywalker Ready.
obiwan_kenobi . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.
anakin_skywalker Well then, we're safe for the time being.
obiwan_kenobi Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.
anakin_skywalker They're sealing this section off.
obiwan_kenobi Six droids coming our way!
anakin_skywalker Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.
obiwan_kenobi We'll never get through that. It's too small!
anakin_skywalker I found our escape vent.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.
anakin_skywalker Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .
anakin_skywalker Here's a way out.
obiwan_kenobi That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.
anakin_skywalker The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.
obiwan_kenobi You still have much to learn, Anakin.
battle_droid r77 I have a bad feeling about this.
obiwan_kenobi All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let's go!
anakin_skywalker Destroyers!!
battle_droid droid Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em.
obiwan_kenobi Did you press the stop button?
anakin_skywalker No, did you?
obiwan_kenobi No!
anakin_skywalker Well, there's more than one way out of here.
obiwan_kenobi We don't want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . . . . 31174 . . .
super_battle_droid_1#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 What's that?
super_battle_droid_2#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Get back to work. It's nothing.
obiwan_kenobi Artoo?
obiwan_kenobi Always on the move.
obiwan_kenobi Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.
obiwan_kenobi Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.
droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 1 Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.
droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 2 Roger, roger.
super_battle_droid_1#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 There it is again.
obiwan_kenobi Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.
obiwan_kenobi Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!
super_battle_droid_1#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Hey you!
obiwan_kenobi Now, that's better . . .
super_battle_droid_1#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You stupid little astro droid!
obiwan_kenobi Oh, it's you . . .
anakin_skywalker What was that all about?
obiwan_kenobi Well, Artoo has been . . .
anakin_skywalker No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.
obiwan_kenobi Did I say anything?
anakin_skywalker He's trying!
obiwan_kenobi I didn't say anything!
obiwan_kenobi Chancellor.
anakin_skywalker Are you all right?
senator_palpatine Count Dooku.
obiwan_kenobi This time we will do it together.
anakin_skywalker I was about to say that.
senator_palpatine Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.
obiwan_kenobi Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
obiwan_kenobi and anakin throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.
count_dooku Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.
obiwan_kenobi and anakin move toward DOOKU.
obiwan_kenobi You won't get away this time, Dooku.
obiwan_kenobi and anakin charge count_dooku. A great sword fight ensues.
count_dooku I've been looking forward to this.
anakin_skywalker My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
count_dooku Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.
count_dooku Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better.
count_dooku I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don’t use them.
senator_palpatine Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!
anakin_skywalker I shouldn't . . .
senator_palpatine Do it!!
anakin_skywalker ... I couldn't stop myself.
senator_palpatine You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
anakin_skywalker Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
anakin_skywalker I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.
senator_palpatine It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.
senator_palpatine Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.
anakin_skywalker He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.
senator_palpatine Leave him, or we'll never make it.
anakin_skywalker His fate will be the same as ours.
general_grievous Prepare for attack.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 All batteries fire! Fire!
anakin_skywalker The elevator's not working, Artoo . . .
r2d2 BEEPS a response to anakin.
anakin_skywalker . . . Activate Elevator 3224.
anakin_skywalker Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Reverse stabilizers.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Magnetize! Magnetize!
anakin_skywalker We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast.
general_grievous Fire the emergency booster engines.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Leveling out, sir.
anakin_skywalker Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.
obiwan_kenobi Did I miss something?
anakin_skywalker Hold on.
obiwan_kenobi What is that?
obiwan_kenobi Oops.
anakin_skywalker Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!
obiwan_kenobi Too late! Jump!
obiwan_kenobi Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on.
anakin_skywalker Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?
obiwan_kenobi and anakin lead palpatine down a hallway toward the hangar bay.
obiwan_kenobi None of those ships will get us anywhere.
anakin_skywalker I agree.
senator_palpatine What are we going to do?
anakin_skywalker I don't know.
obiwan_kenobi Don't look at me. I don't know.
anakin_skywalker Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.
obiwan_kenobi We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.
anakin/obi-wan#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Well, that was close.
naboo_royal_security_guard General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328.
general_grievous Activate ray shields.
anakin_skywalker Ray shields!
obiwan_kenobi Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.
anakin_skywalker Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.
obiwan_kenobi Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.
anakin_skywalker You're the Master. I'm just a hero.
obiwan_kenobi I'm open to suggestions here.
senator_palpatine Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.
anakin_skywalker I say . . . patience.
obiwan_kenobi Patience! That's your plan, is it?
anakin_skywalker Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .
anakin_skywalker See! No problem.
battle_droid Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.
obiwan_kenobi Do you have a plan B?
general_grievous Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.
obiwan_kenobi That depends upon your point of view. Hah!
general_grievous And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.
anakin_skywalker General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.
general_grievous Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.
general_grievous Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.
obiwan_kenobi Not this time. And this time you won't escape.
anakin_skywalker Artoo.
general_grievous Crush them! Make them suffer!
general_grievous Stay and watch your stations.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.
general_grievous Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.
obiwan_kenobi and anakin destroy the remaining DROIDS. general grievous retrieves one of the bodyguard'S staffs and faces obi-wan. anakin leaps over a console and lands behind general grievous.
general_grievous You lose, General Kenobi.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 The ship is breaking up!
general_grievous We've run out of time.
senator_palpatine The hull is burning up!
general_grievous Time to abandon ship.
obiwan_kenobi and anakin go over to the navigator's chair.
anakin_skywalker All the escape pods have been launched.
obiwan_kenobi Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?
anakin_skywalker You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?
obiwan_kenobi Well?
anakin_skywalker Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.
obiwan_kenobi Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.
r2d2 beeps.
anakin_skywalker Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.
obiwan_kenobi Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .
anakin_skywalker We lost something.
obiwan_kenobi Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship.
anakin_skywalker Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.
obiwan_kenobi Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .
anakin_skywalker What's our speed?
obiwan_kenobi Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .
r2d2 beeps
anakin_skywalker Grab that . . . Keep us level.
obiwan_kenobi Steady. Steady.
anakin_skywalker Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.
obiwan_kenobi Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 We'll take you in.
obiwan_kenobi Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.
anakin_skywalker We're coming in too hot.
obiwan_kenobi Easy-easy.
obiwan_kenobi Another happy landing.
anakin_skywalker Are you coming, Master?
obiwan_kenobi Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
anakin_skywalker Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.
obiwan_kenobi Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .
anakin_skywalker All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.
obiwan_kenobi . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
anakin_skywalker All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .
obiwan_kenobi Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.
mace_windu Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?
senator_palpatine Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.
mace_windu General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.
senator_palpatine That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.
mace_windu Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.
senator_bail_organa Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.
anakin_skywalker Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.
c3po It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.
r2d2 beeps.
c3po Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.
senator_bail_organa The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.
anakin_skywalker I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.
Behind#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. anakin senses the figure.
senator_bail_organa I'll do everything I can with the Senate.
anakin_skywalker Excuse me.
senator_bail_organa Certainly.
anakin_skywalker stops, and bail goes off after palpatine and the others. anakin goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR padme AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.
padme Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.
anakin_skywalker I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.
padme There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.
anakin_skywalker I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.
padme Wait, not here . . .
anakin_skywalker Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.
padme Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .
anakin_skywalker I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.
padme I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.
anakin_skywalker Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
padme I'm just excited to see you.
anakin_skywalker That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?
padme Nothing . . . nothing . . .
anakin_skywalker You're frightened. Tell me what's going on!
padme You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .
anakin_skywalker . . . Is there someone else?
padme No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.
anakin_skywalker I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.
padme I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.
anakin_skywalker It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .
padme Something wonderful has happened.
padme I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.
anakin_skywalker That's . . . that's wonderful.
padme What are we going to do?
anakin_skywalker We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.
battle_droid G21 The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control.
general_grievous Good. Where is the Separatist Council?
battle_droid G21 This way, sir ...
general_grievous Yes, Lord Sidious.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.
general_grievous It will be done, My Lord.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.
general_grievous But the loss of Count Dooku?
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.
anakin_skywalker . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.
padme Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.
anakin_skywalker You are so beautiful!
padme It's only because I'm so in love . . .
anakin_skywalker No, it's because I'm so in love with you.
padme So love has blinded you?
anakin_skywalker Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .
padme But it's probably true!
anakin_skywalker I haven't laughed in so long . . .
padme Neither have I.
padme Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.
padme Anakin??
padme What's bothering you?
anakin_skywalker Nothing . . .
anakin_skywalker I remember when I gave this to you.
padme Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?
anakin_skywalker It was a dream.
padme Bad?
anakin_skywalker Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.
padme And?
anakin_skywalker It was about you.
padme Tell me.
anakin_skywalker It was only a dream.
anakin_skywalker You die in childbirth . . .
padme And the baby?
anakin_skywalker I don't know.
padme It was only a dream.
anakin_skywalker . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.
padme Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.
anakin_skywalker I know ….
padme Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?
anakin_skywalker Have you told him anything?
padme No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.
anakin_skywalker He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!
padme I won't, Anakin.
anakin_skywalker I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.
yoda Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .
anakin_skywalker They are of pain, suffering, death . . .
yoda Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
anakin_skywalker Someone . . .
yoda . . . close to you?
anakin_skywalker Yes.
yoda Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
anakin_skywalker I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
yoda Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.
anakin_skywalker What must I do, Master Yoda?
yoda Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
obiwan_kenobi You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.
anakin_skywalker I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.
obiwan_kenobi In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
anakin_skywalker What's wrong then?
obiwan_kenobi The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.
anakin_skywalker Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.
anakin_skywalker Be careful of what?
obiwan_kenobi He has requested your presence.
anakin_skywalker What for?
obiwan_kenobi He would not say.
anakin_skywalker He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?
obiwan_kenobi All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.
anakin_skywalker I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?
obiwan_kenobi The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.
senator_palpatine Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.
anakin_skywalker The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?
senator_palpatine They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.
anakin_skywalker I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.
senator_palpatine There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.
anakin_skywalker With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.
senator_palpatine Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.
anakin_skywalker Everyone will agree on that.
senator_palpatine Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.
anakin_skywalker Of course.
senator_palpatine I need your help, son.
anakin_skywalker What do you mean?
senator_palpatine I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.
anakin_skywalker I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.
senator_palpatine Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.
anakin_skywalker For what? I don't understand.
senator_palpatine To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .
senator_palpatine Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
anakin_skywalker Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.
senator_palpatine I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.
senator_bail_organa Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.
fang_zar When did this happen?
senator_bail_organa The decree was posted this morning.
padme Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?
mon_mothma Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.
giddean_danu The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.
senator_bail_organa We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.
terr_taneel What are you suggesting?
senator_bail_organa I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.
mon_mothma We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.
senator_bail_organa It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.
padme I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.
giddean_danu Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.
mon_mothma The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.
senator_bail_organa We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .
padme Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid.
senator_bail_organa Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.
mon_mothma That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.
padme Agreed.
mace_windu Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.
anakin_skywalker I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.
yoda Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
anakin_skywalker I understand.
mace_windu You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.
anakin_skywalker What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?
mace_windu Take a seat, young Skywalker.
anakin_skywalker Forgive me, Master.
kiadimundi We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.
yoda Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.
obiwan_kenobi It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.
mace_windu We cannot take ships from the front line.
obiwan_kenobi And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.
yoda Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.
kiadimundi What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
mace_windu It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!
obiwan_kenobi He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.
anakin_skywalker I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.
mace_windu Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.
yoda Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
mace_windu It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.
anakin_skywalker What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!
obiwan_kenobi Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
anakin_skywalker I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .
obiwan_kenobi But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
anakin_skywalker That has nothing to do with this.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.
anakin_skywalker You mean divided loyalties.
obiwan_kenobi I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.
anakin_skywalker The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.
obiwan_kenobi No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.
anakin_skywalker Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.
obiwan_kenobi I hope so . . .
anakin_skywalker I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.
anakin_skywalker And?
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.
anakin_skywalker What situation?
obiwan_kenobi The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.
anakin_skywalker They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!
obiwan_kenobi We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.
anakin_skywalker Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?
obiwan_kenobi This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.
anakin_skywalker The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
obiwan_kenobi That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.
anakin_skywalker Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.
obiwan_kenobi Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.
anakin_skywalker You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?
obiwan_kenobi The Council is asking you.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.
yoda Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.
mace_windu It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.
obiwan_kenobi He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.
mace_windu I wish I did.
obiwan_kenobi With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
mace_windu So the prophecy says.
yoda A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.
obiwan_kenobi He will not let me down. He never has.
yoda I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.
padme Thank you, Captain.
capt_typho Rest well. My Lady.
capt_typho gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach padme as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. c-3po is standing nearby.
padme I'll be up in a while.
motee Yes, my lady.
c3po Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?
padme Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.
anakin_skywalker Beautiful, isn't it?
padme You startled me.
anakin_skywalker How are you feeling?
padme He keeps kicking.
anakin_skywalker He?! Why do you think it's a boy?
padme My motherly intuition.
anakin_skywalker Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.
padme I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.
anakin_skywalker I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.
padme Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.
anakin_skywalker They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.
padme Anakin . . .
anakin_skywalker Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
padme Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
anakin_skywalker What do you mean?
padme What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?
anakin_skywalker I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!
padme Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
anakin_skywalker Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!
padme What is it?
anakin_skywalker Nothing.
padme Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.
anakin_skywalker You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.
anakin_skywalker I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.
padme I sense there are things you are not telling me.
padme smiles. anakin is a little embarrassed.
padme Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.
anakin_skywalker You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
senator_palpatine Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.
anakin_skywalker At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.
senator_palpatine I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far … but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.
anakin_skywalker They try.
senator_palpatine Sit down, Leave us.
senator_palpatine Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.
anakin_skywalker I'm not sure I understand.
senator_palpatine You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.
anakin_skywalker I don't think . . .
senator_palpatine Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?
anakin_skywalker I know they don't trust you . . .
senator_palpatine Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.
anakin_skywalker I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.
senator_palpatine Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?
senator_palpatine They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?
anakin_skywalker I don't know ... I don't know what to say.
senator_palpatine Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.
anakin_skywalker The Jedi use their power for good.
senator_palpatine Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .
anakin_skywalker . . . evil.
senator_palpatine . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.
anakin_skywalker The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.
senator_palpatine And the Jedi don't?
anakin_skywalker The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.
senator_palpatine smiles.
senator_palpatine Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?
anakin_skywalker I'm not sure it's wrong.
senator_palpatine Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.
senator_palpatine Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?
anakin_skywalker No.
senator_palpatine I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
anakin_skywalker He could actually save people from death?
senator_palpatine The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
anakin_skywalker What happened to him?
senator_palpatine He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
anakin_skywalker Is it possible to learn this power?
senator_palpatine Not from a Jedi.
kiadimundi Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.
mace_windu How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.
anakin_skywalker A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
yoda Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
obiwan_kenobi Does everyone agree?
All#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 the JEDI concur.
anakin_skywalker The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
mace_windu The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.
kiadimundi Yes, this decision is ours to make.
yoda A Master is needed, with more experience.
mace_windu Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.
anakin_skywalker He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.
anakin_skywalker No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.
obiwan_kenobi Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.
yoda Obi-Wan, my choice is.
kiadimundi I concur. Master Kenobi should go.
yoda I agree.
All#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 the JEDI concur.
mace_windu Very well. Council is adjourned.
mace_windu Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.
clone_trooper commander gree The droids have started up their main power generators.
yoda Then now the time is, Commander.
clone_trooper commander gree Yes, sir.
obiwan_kenobi Has Anakin been to see you?
padme Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.
obiwan_kenobi I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.
padme You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?
obiwan_kenobi You should be a Jedi, Padme.
padme You're not very good at hiding your feelings.
obiwan_kenobi It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.
padme Why would he talk to me about his work?
obiwan_kenobi Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.
padme Don't give me that look.
obiwan_kenobi I know how he feels about you.
padme What did he say?
obiwan_kenobi Nothing. He didn't have to.
padme I don't know what you're talking about.
obiwan_kenobi I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him.
obiwan_kenobi I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .
obiwan_kenobi Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .
padme Thank you, Obi-Wan.
obiwan_kenobi Please do what you can to help him.
padme We cannot let this turn into another war.
senator_bail_organa Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.
mon_mothma We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.
padme I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.
senator_bana_breemu That would be dangerous.
mon_mothma We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.
padme I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.
giddean_danu Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.
padme The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .
chi_eekway Patience, Senator.
fang_zar We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.
senator_bana_breemu When you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the Chancellor, things may change.
senator_bail_organa Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.
anakin_skywalker You're going to need me on this one, Master.
obiwan_kenobi Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.
anakin_skywalker Master!
anakin_skywalker Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.
obiwan_kenobi You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.
obiwan_kenobi Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.
anakin_skywalker Well, there's always a first time.
anakin_skywalker Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.
obiwan_kenobi Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.
commander_cody Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.
obiwan_kenobi I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.
commander_cody Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?
obiwan_kenobi Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.
commander_cody That was Anakin who was late. I believe.
obiwan_kenobi Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.
commander_cody I'm counting on you.
senator_palpatine Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?
anakin_skywalker He will soon have Grievous's head.
senator_palpatine We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.
anakin_skywalker The Council was very sure in its decision.
jar_jar_binks Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .
anakin_skywalker Hi, Jar Jar.
jar_jar_binks Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.
senator_palpatine There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.
anakin_skywalker Not fit? Why would anyone think that?
senator_palpatine They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.
anakin_skywalker That's ridiculous. Who?!?
senator_palpatine No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.
anakin_skywalker That's impossible. I would know.
senator_palpatine Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.
senator_palpatine Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.
obiwan_kenobi Save your energy.
padme I can't!
obiwan_kenobi Don't give up, Padme. Don't give up . . .
anakin_skywalker I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?
padme He came by this morning.
anakin_skywalker What did he want?
padme He's worried about you.
anakin_skywalker You told him about us, didn't you?
padme He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.
anakin_skywalker And he's not?
padme You have been moody lately.
anakin_skywalker I'm not moody . . .
padme Anakin! Don't do this again.
anakin_skywalker I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.
padme Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.
anakin_skywalker Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
padme They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
anakin_skywalker Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.
padme You expect too much of yourself.
anakin_skywalker I have found a way to save you.
padme Save me?
anakin_skywalker From my nightmares.
padme Is that what's bothering you?
anakin_skywalker I won't lose you, Padme.
padme I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.
anakin_skywalker No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.
padme You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.
tion_medon Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?
obiwan_kenobi Unfortunately, the war.
tion_medon There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.
obiwan_kenobi With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.
tion_medon He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.
obiwan_kenobi I understand.
tion_medon The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .
obiwan_kenobi Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.
obiwan_kenobi Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact.
tion_medon I told you, all he wanted was fuel.
naboo_royal_security_guard What was his name?
tion_medon He didn't say.
obiwan_kenobi also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city.
obiwan_kenobi I need transportation.
wrangler#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You need transportation.
obiwan_kenobi Get it for me.
wrangler#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I will get it for you.
obiwan_kenobi This one.
wrangler#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Boga. She answers to Boga.
obiwan_kenobi Good girl, Boga.
general_grievous It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.
nute_gunray Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.
general_grievous Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.
obiwan_kenobi Hello, there!
general_grievous General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed, Kill him!
general_grievous Enough of this.
general_grievous Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
obiwan_kenobi Your move.
general_grievous You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.
obiwan_kenobi You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!
obiwan_kenobi I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.
general_grievous Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.
obiwan_kenobi I don't think so.
senator_palpatine I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.
padme May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?
senator_palpatine I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .
padme You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.
senator_palpatine You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.
fang_zar But surely . . .
senator_palpatine I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.
padme On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.
senator_palpatine I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.
senator_palpatine Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.
anakin_skywalker What do you mean?
senator_palpatine They are not to be trusted.
anakin_skywalker Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .
senator_palpatine These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.
anakin_skywalker I'm sure you're mistaken.
senator_palpatine I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.
anakin_skywalker I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.
senator_palpatine Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.
commander_cody Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack.
mace_windu Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
mace_windu I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.
kiadimundi If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from office.
mace_windu That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .
kiadimundi . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.
yoda To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.
anakin_skywalker Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.
senator_palpatine We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
anakin_skywalker I should be there with him.
senator_palpatine It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?
anakin_skywalker I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.
senator_palpatine They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
anakin_skywalker How do you know the ways of the Force?
senator_palpatine My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.
anakin_skywalker You know the dark side?!?
senator_palpatine Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.
anakin_skywalker I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.
senator_palpatine Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
anakin_skywalker What did you say?
senator_palpatine Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .
anakin_skywalker You're a Sith Lord!
senator_palpatine I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.
anakin_skywalker You're wrong!
senator_palpatine Are you going to kill me?
anakin_skywalker I would certainly like to.
senator_palpatine I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.
anakin_skywalker I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
senator_palpatine Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?
anakin_skywalker I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
senator_palpatine You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.
senator_palpatine I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .
obiwan_kenobi and general grievous race through the city at breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides.
general_grievous Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.
obiwan_kenobi So uncivilized . . .
anakin_skywalker Master Windu, I must talk to you.
mace_windu What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.
anakin_skywalker He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
mace_windu A Sith Lord?
anakin_skywalker Yes. The one we have been looking for.
mace_windu How do you know this?
anakin_skywalker He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.
mace_windu Are you sure?
anakin_skywalker Absolutely.
mace_windu Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.
anakin_skywalker Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.
mace_windu For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.
anakin_skywalker I must go, Master.
mace_windu No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
mace_windu Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.
anakin_skywalker Yes, Master.
senator_palpatine You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.
padme I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.
c3po My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?
anakin_skywalker I can't do this ... I can't let her die.
senator_palpatine Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.
mace_windu In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.
senator_palpatine Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
mace_windu The Senate will decide your fate.
senator_palpatine I am the Senate!
mace_windu Not yet!
senator_palpatine It's treason, then.
Jedi#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Master mace WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. palpatine is able to use the Force to slam mace against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down.
mace_windu You are under arrest, My Lord.
senator_palpatine Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.
mace_windu You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .
senator_palpatine No! No! You will die!
senator_palpatine He is a traitor, Anakin.
mace_windu He's the traitor. Stop him!
senator_palpatine Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.
mace_windu Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .
senator_palpatine You are not one of them, Anakin. Don't let him kill me.
mace_windu Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .
senator_palpatine I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.
mace_windu Don't listen to him, Anakin.
senator_palpatine Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .
senator_palpatine I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.
mace_windu You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.
anakin_skywalker You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.
mace_windu He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.
senator_palpatine I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.
anakin_skywalker It is not the Jedi way . . .
anakin_skywalker He must live . . .
senator_palpatine Please don't, please don't . . .
anakin_skywalker I need him . . .
senator_palpatine Please don't . . .
anakin_skywalker NO!!!
senator_palpatine Power! Unlimited power!
anakin_skywalker What have I done?
senator_palpatine You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.
anakin_skywalker I will do whatever you ask.
senator_palpatine Good.
anakin_skywalker Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.
senator_palpatine To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.
anakin_skywalker I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.
senator_palpatine Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.
anakin_skywalker Thank you. my Master.
senator_palpatine Rise, Darth Vader.
senator_palpatine Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.
anakin_skywalker I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.
senator_palpatine Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?
anakin_skywalker I understand, Master.
senator_palpatine We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.
anakin_skywalker What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?
senator_palpatine Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.
obiwan_kenobi Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.
commander_cody Very good, sir.
commander_cody Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this.
obiwan_kenobi Thank you, Cody, Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here.
commander_cody Yes, sir!
obiwan_kenobi and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
commander_cody It will be done, My Lord.
commander_cody Blast him!
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Commander 1138 . . .
clone_trooper commander bacara Yes, sir.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
clone_trooper commander bacara It will be done, My Lord.
aayla_secura Steady. . . . steady . . .
aayla_secura Bly, do you think they're Droids?
bly#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 No.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Execute Order Sixty-Six.
CLONE#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 pilot It will be done, My Lord.
plo_koon heads his ship toward a battle on a landing platform.
plo_koon There they are. Land on the nearest platform.
clone_trooper commander gree Yes, My Lord.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.
clone_trooper commander gree It will be done, My Lord.
clone_trooper commander gree snaps his comlink shut.
jedi_youngling Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?
c3po and padme look out the apartment window.
c3po The Chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don't worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right.
senator_bail_organa What's going on here?!?
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 There's been a rebellion. Don't worry, sir, the situation is under control.
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I'm sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry.
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 It's time for you to leave, sir.
senator_bail_organa And so it is.
clone_trooper commander appo Get him! Shoot him!
AT-ST#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 clone sergeant Everyone out of there!
creature#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee.
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Did you find something?
creature#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 It's nothing, nothing.
clone_sergeant#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.
clone_trooper trooper Yes, sir.
creature#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be.
yoda Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.
yoda Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .
yoda Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.
naboo_royal_guard guard Identification . . .
senator_bail_organa Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.
senator_bail_organa Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?
captain_raymus_antilles Yes, sir. We've encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.
senator_bail_organa That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.
CLONE#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 captain Did you find Kenobi?
clone_trooper trooper No one could have survived that fall.
CLONE#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 captain Start loading your men on the ship.
clone_trooper trooper Yes, sir.
obiwan_kenobi Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .
senator_bail_organa . . . Kenobi . . .
obiwan_kenobi I've locked on. Repeat.
senator_bail_organa Master Kenobi??
obiwan_kenobi Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help.
senator_bail_organa We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates.
c3po My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.
c3po Hush! Not so loud!
padme Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.
anakin_skywalker I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
padme Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?
c3po What is going on?
r2d2 SQUEAKS and BEEPS.
c3po You can't be anymore confused than I am.
anakin_skywalker The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .
padme I can't believe that!
anakin_skywalker I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.
c3po Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.
r2d2 BEEPS rather loudly. c-3po puts his fingers to his lips.
c3po Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.
r2d2 BEEPS quietly.
c3po Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.
padme Anakin, what are you going to do?
anakin_skywalker I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.
padme What about Obi-Wan?
anakin_skywalker I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.
padme How could this have happened?, f
anakin_skywalker The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.
padme What are you saying?
anakin_skywalker You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.
padme What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?
anakin_skywalker That won't happen. I won't let it.
padme Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.
anakin_skywalker Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.
anakin_skywalker Please, wait for me.
padme I will.
c3po Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.
r2d2 beeps.
c3po Take care, my little friend.
r2d2 BEEPS
c3po My Lady, is there anything I might do?
padme No thank you, Threepio.
g3po A snack, perhaps?
padme No.
c3po I feel so helpless.
senator_bail_organa You made it.
yoda Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.
obiwan_kenobi You were attacked by your Clones, also?
yoda With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.
obiwan_kenobi How many other Jedi managed to survive?
yoda Heard from no one, have we.
senator_bail_organa I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.
obiwan_kenobi Have we had any contact from the Temple?
yoda Received a coded retreat message, we have.
senator_bail_organa It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .
obiwan_kenobi Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.
senator_bail_organa It's too dangerous to return.
yoda Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?
obiwan_kenobi Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.
yoda I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.
nute_gunray The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 We are receiving a message from the Chancellor's office, sir.
senator_bail_organa Send it through.
pilot#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Yes, sir.
mas_amedda Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.
senator_bail_organa Tell the Chancellor I will be there.
mas_amedda Very well. He will be expecting you.
senator_bail_organa It could be a trap.
obiwan_kenobi No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.
yoda If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.
guard#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?
senator_bail_organa Certainly.
guard#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi.
obiwan_kenobi It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.
guard#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 It would be better if they stayed with you.
anakin_skywalker Artoo . . . stay with the ship.
r2d2 BEEP
nute_gunray Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.
obiwan_kenobi There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.
yoda Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.
senator_palpatine . . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.
senator_bail_organa I was held up. What's happening?
padme The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.
senator_bail_organa That's not true!
padme He's been presenting evidence all afternoon.
senator_bail_organa And the Senate will go along with it, just like they always do.
senator_palpatine The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. These have been trying times, but we have passed the test.
obiwan_kenobi Not even the younglings survived.
yoda Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.
obiwan_kenobi . . .Who?? Who could have done this?
senator_palpatine The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger.
senator_palpatine The war is over. The Separatists have been defeated, and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.
padme Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy.
senator_palpatine In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.
senator_palpatine An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .
senator_palpatine An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . .
padme So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . .
senator_bail_organa We cannot let this happen.
padme Not now! There will be a time.
rune_haako haako Stop! Enough, this is not right!
nute_gunray The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace ... we only want . . .
obiwan_kenobi I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.
yoda Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.
obiwan_kenobi Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . .
yoda If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.
obiwan_kenobi I must know the truth, Master.
obiwan_kenobi It can't be . . . It can't be . . .
anakin_skywalker The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?
anakin_skywalker Yes, My Master.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.
obiwan_kenobi I can't watch any more.
yoda Destroy the Sith, we must.
obiwan_kenobi Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.
yoda To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.
obiwan_kenobi He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.
yoda Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.
obiwan_kenobi How could it have come to this?
yoda To question, no time there is.
obiwan_kenobi I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.
yoda Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.
obiwan_kenobi May the Force be with you, Master Yoda.
c3po Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.
obiwan_kenobi Has Anakin been here . . . ?
c3po Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.
padme Master Kenobi . . .
padme Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.
obiwan_kenobi The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .
padme I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone.
obiwan_kenobi I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.
padme The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.
obiwan_kenobi No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.
padme The Sith!?!
obiwan_kenobi I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?
padme Yesterday.
obiwan_kenobi And do you know where he is now?
padme No.
obiwan_kenobi Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger.
padme From the Sith?
obiwan_kenobi From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.
padme You're wrong! How could you even say that?
obiwan_kenobi I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.
padme Not Anakin! He couldn't!
obiwan_kenobi He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.
padme I don't believe you ... I can't.
obiwan_kenobi Padme, I must find him.
padme You're going to kill him, aren't you?
obiwan_kenobi He has become a very great threat.
padme I can't . . .
obiwan_kenobi Anakin is the father, isn't he?
obiwan_kenobi I'm so sorry.
capt_typho My Lady, let me come with you.
padme There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.
capt_typho bows.
capt_typho As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.
padme I'll be all right, Captain.
padme This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.
c3po Oh, dear.
c3po Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.
darth_vader The Separatists are taken care of, My Master.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. You have done well, Lord Vader.
darth_vader Thank you, My Master.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.
darth_vader Very good, My Lord.
anakin_skywalker Padme, I saw your ship . . .
padme Oh, Anakin!
anakin_skywalker It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?
padme I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
anakin_skywalker What things?
padme He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.
anakin_skywalker Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
padme He cares about us.
anakin_skywalker Us??!
padme He knows . . . He wants to help you.
anakin_skywalker Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.
padme Anakin, all I want is your love.
anakin_skywalker Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.
padme At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.
anakin_skywalker I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.
padme Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.
anakin_skywalker Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.
padme I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.
anakin_skywalker I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.
padme I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I can't follow.
anakin_skywalker Because of Obi-Wan?
padme Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.
anakin_skywalker Liar!
padme No!
anakin_skywalker You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!
padme NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...
obiwan_kenobi Let her go, Anakin.
anakin_skywalker What have you and she been up to?
obiwan_kenobi Let her go!
anakin_skywalker You turned her against me.
obiwan_kenobi You have done that yourself.
anakin_skywalker You will not take her from me.
obiwan_kenobi Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.
obiwan_kenobi You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
anakin_skywalker Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.
obiwan_kenobi Your new Empire?
anakin_skywalker Don't make me kill you.
obiwan_kenobi Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.
anakin_skywalker If you're not with me, you're my enemy.
obiwan_kenobi Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.
anakin_skywalker You will try.
r2d2 BEEPS
yoda I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Master Yoda, you survived.
yoda Surprised?
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.
c3po What are you doing? You're going to hurt her. Wait!!
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.
yoda Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.
yoda At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.
yoda If so powerful you are, why leave??
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.
yoda Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.
anakin_skywalker Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side.
obiwan_kenobi I've heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I'd hear it from you.
obiwan_kenobi The flaw of power is arrogance.
anakin_skywalker You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.
obiwan_kenobi and anakin lock sabers. obi-wan puts out his hand to use the Force to push anakin away. anakin puts out his hand to block obi-wan.
yoda Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.
yoda Hurry. Careful timing we will need.
senator_bail_organa There aren't many troops on this side. Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.
clone_trooper commander thire There is no sign of his body, sir.
mas_amedda Then he is not dead.
senator_palpatine Double your search.
clone_trooper commander thire Yes sir. Right away, sir.
senator_palpatine Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.
mas_amedda Yes, Master.
senator_palpatine I sense Lord Vader is in danger.
obiwan_kenobi and anakin battle on the top of the multispired collection panels, jumping from one to the other. At the end of the collection cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the collectors. The frame begins to melt. It's raining lava. Both anakin and obi-wan run for cover under the collection cluster. They continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then quickly retreating to cover.
yoda Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.
c3po I am being careful. I've got a good hold on her, but . . . I'm worried about my back. I hope it's able to hold up under this weight.
obiwan_kenobi and anakin continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. anakin, standing on the Droid, approaches obi-wan on the work platform.
obiwan_kenobi I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.
anakin_skywalker I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .
obiwan_kenobi From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.
anakin_skywalker From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.
obiwan_kenobi Well, then you are lost!
anakin_skywalker This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.
obiwan_kenobi It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.
anakin_skywalker You underestimate my power!
obiwan_kenobi Don't try it.
obiwan_kenobi . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.
anakin_skywalker I hate you!
obiwan_kenobi You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.
c3po Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.
padme Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.
CLONE#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 captain Yes sir. Right away.
yoda Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...
quigon_jinn Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.
yoda Eternal consciousness.
quigon_jinn The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.
yoda . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.
quigon_jinn You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.
yoda A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.
senator_bail_organa Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.
senator_bail_organa We'll take her to the medical center, quickly.
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.
obiwan_kenobi She's dying?
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.
senator_bail_organa Babies??!!
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 She's carrying twins.
yoda Save them, we must. They are our last hope.
c3po It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.
obiwan_kenobi Don't give up, Padme.
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 It's a boy.
padme Luke . . .
padme can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead.
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 ... and a girl.
padme . . . Leia.
obiwan_kenobi You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.
padme I can't . . .
obiwan_kenobi Save your energy.
padme Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .
medical_droid#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Good. Good.
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 Lord Vader, can you hear me?
darth_vader Yes, My Master.
darth_vader Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?
darth_sidious#unknown#StarWars.Episode03 I'm afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.
darth_vader I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!
yoda Pregnant, she must still appear. Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.
obiwan_kenobi We must take them somewhere the Sith will not sense their presence.
yoda Split up, they should be.
senator_bail_organa My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.
obiwan_kenobi And what of the boy?
yoda To Tatooine. To his family, send him.
obiwan_kenobi I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?
yoda Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.
yoda Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.
obiwan_kenobi Training??
yoda An old friend has learned the path to immortality.
obiwan_kenobi Who?
yoda One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
obiwan_kenobi Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?
yoda The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.
obiwan_kenobi I will be able to talk with him?
yoda How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.
senator_bail_organa Captain Antilles.
captain_raymus_antilles Yes, Your Highness.
senator_bail_organa I'm placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the Protocol Droid's mind wiped.
c3po Oh, no.

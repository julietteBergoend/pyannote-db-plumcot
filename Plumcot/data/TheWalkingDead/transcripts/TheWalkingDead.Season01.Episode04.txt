amy_harrison and andrea are fishing out in a boat .
amy_harrison What ?
andrea_harrison Nothing
amy_harrison It's not nothing .
amy_harrison It's always something
andrea_harrison Didn't dad teach you to tie nail knots ?
amy_harrison Why would he do that ?
amy_harrison He only ever used a fisherman's knot .
amy_harrison One knot
andrea_harrison No , he didn't .
andrea_harrison No , he tied at least three
amy_harrison Clinch knots ?
amy_harrison No way
andrea_harrison Fine , I'm making it up .
andrea_harrison Did dad teach you mostly dry lures ?
amy_harrison Yeah .
amy_harrison You ?
andrea_harrison Wet
amy_harrison You're kidding .
amy_harrison But he was always so adamant .
amy_harrison I mean , you know dad on the fishing thing
andrea_harrison Gee , you think ?
andrea_harrison I only spent my entire childhood with my ass in a boat .
andrea_harrison But in my day it was all about getting the hook seated .
andrea_harrison We were fishing for the dinner table
amy_harrison Not us .
amy_harrison We always threw them back .
amy_harrison Always
andrea_harrison I guess he changed things up
amy_harrison But that'd be like changing his religion or something
andrea_harrison People change .
andrea_harrison It's not his fault we were born 12 years apart
amy_harrison No .
amy_harrison No , because the minute you went off to college
amy_harrison it was my ass in that boat
amy_harrison and he taught me dry lures from day one .
amy_harrison This was not behavior developed over time
andrea_harrison You think he did it for us ?
amy_harrison Because he knew we were so different .
amy_harrison He knew that you needed to catch the fish
amy_harrison and I needed to throw them back
andrea_harrison All right , remember his rule No crying in the boat .
andrea_harrison It scares the fish
amy_harrison Mom and dad .
amy_harrison I mean , maybe Florida wasn't hit so bad .
amy_harrison Maybe it's better there .
amy_harrison Do you think ?
andrea_harrison I think you have a bite .
andrea_harrison Even with the wrong knots
amy_harrison Oh God .
amy_harrison So much for the no crying rule
andrea_harrison I think that was more for dad than the fish
rick_grimes I won't hesitate .
rick_grimes I don't care if every walker in the city hears it
daryl_dixon You got a do-rag or something ?
daryl_dixon I guess the saw blade was too dull for the handcuffs .
daryl_dixon Ain't that a bitch He must have used a tourniquet .
daryl_dixon maybe his belt .
daryl_dixon Be much more blood if he didn't Merle ?
daryl_dixon You in here ?
dale_horvath Jim ?
dale_horvath You
dale_horvath okay ?
dale_horvath You keep this up , you're gonna keel over out here .
dale_horvath Drink some water at least
daryl_dixon Had enough in him to take out these two sumbitches .
daryl_dixon One handed .
daryl_dixon Toughest asshole
daryl_dixon I ever met , my brother .
daryl_dixon Feed him a hammer , he'd crap out nails
rick_grimes Any man can pass out from blood loss , no matter how tough he is
morales Oh , baby .
morales Will you look at that ?
morales Hey , check it out .

morales Because of you my children will eat tonight .
morales Thank you

lori_grimes Thank you
carl_grimes Whoa
lori_grimes Yeah , whoa .
lori_grimes Where did you two learn to do that ?
amy_harrison Our dad
carl_grimes Can you teach me how to do that ?
amy_harrison Sure .
amy_harrison I'll teach you all about nail knots and stuff .
amy_harrison If that's okay
lori_grimes You won't catch me arguing
andrea_harrison Hey , Dale .
andrea_harrison When's the last time you oiled those line reels ?
andrea_harrison They are a disgrace
dale_horvath I , uh , I don't want to alarm anyone , but we may have a bit of a problem
daryl_dixon Merle !
rick_grimes We're not alone here .
rick_grimes Remember ?
daryl_dixon Screw that .
daryl_dixon He could be bleeding out .
daryl_dixon You said so yourself  .
theodore_douglas Shh
glenn_rhee What's that burned stuff ?
rick_grimes Skin .
rick_grimes He cauterized the stump
daryl_dixon Told you he was tough .
daryl_dixon Nobody can kill Merle but Merle
rick_grimes Don't take that on faith .
rick_grimes He's lost a lot of blood
daryl_dixon Yeah ?
daryl_dixon Didn't stop him from busting out of this death trap
glenn_rhee He left the building ?
glenn_rhee Why the hell would he do that ?
daryl_dixon Why wouldn't he ?
daryl_dixon He's out there alone as far as he knows , doing what he's got to do .
daryl_dixon Surviving
theodore_douglas You call that surviving ?
theodore_douglas Just wandering out in the streets , maybe passing out ?
theodore_douglas What are his odds out there ?
daryl_dixon No worse than being handcuffed and left to rot by you sorry pricks .
daryl_dixon You couldn't kill him .
daryl_dixon Ain't so worried about some dumb dead b*st*rd
rick_grimes What about 1 , 000 dumb dead bastards ?
rick_grimes Different story ?
daryl_dixon Why don't you take a tally ?
daryl_dixon Do what you want .
daryl_dixon I'm gonna go get him
rick_grimes Daryl , wait
daryl_dixon Get your hands off me !
daryl_dixon You can't stop me
rick_grimes I don't blame you .
rick_grimes He's family , I get that .
rick_grimes I went through hell to find mine .
rick_grimes I know exactly how you feel .
rick_grimes He can't get far with that injury .
rick_grimes We could help you check a few blocks around but only if we keep a level head
daryl_dixon I could do that
theodore_douglas Only if we get those guns first .
theodore_douglas I'm not strolling the streets of Atlanta with just my good intentions , okay ?
shane_walsh Hey , Jim .
shane_walsh Jim , why don't you hold up , all right ?

jim They came out of nowhere .
jim There were dozens of 'em .
jim Just pulled 'em right out of my hands .
jim You know , the only reason I got away was 'cause the dead were too busy eating my family
rick_grimes You're not doing this alone
daryl_dixon Even I think it's a bad idea

rick_grimes All we want to do is talk to them , see if we can work something out
rick_grimes You sure you're up for this ?
theodore_douglas Yeah
rick_grimes Okay

rick_grimes G ?
miguel Guillermo .
miguel He's the man here
rick_grimes Okay
rick_grimes then .
rick_grimes Let's go see guillermo
guillermo You okay
guillermo , little man ?
miguel They're gonna cut off my feet , carnal
guillermo Cops do that ?
miguel Not him .
miguel This redneck puto here .
miguel He cut off some dude's hand , man .

daryl_dixon Shut up
felipe Hey , that's that Vato right there , homes .
felipe He shot me in the ass with an arrow .
felipe What's up , homes , huh ?
guillermo Chill , ese , chill .
guillermo Chill .
guillermo This true ?
guillermo He wants Miguelito's feet ?
guillermo That's pretty sick , man
rick_grimes We were hoping more for a calm discussion
guillermo That hillbilly jumps Felipe's little cousin , beats on him , threatens to cut off his feet , felipe gets an arrow in the ass
guillermo and you want a calm discussion ?
guillermo You fascinate me
rick_grimes Heat of the moment .
rick_grimes Mistakes were made on both sides
guillermo Who's that dude to you anyway ?
guillermo You don't look related
rick_grimes He's one of our group , more or less .
rick_grimes I'm sure you have a few like him
daryl_dixon You got my brother in there ?
guillermo Sorry , we're fresh out of white boys .
guillermo But I've got Asian .
guillermo You interested ?
rick_grimes I have one of yours , you have one of mine .
rick_grimes Sounds like an even trade
guillermo Don't sound even to me
miguel G. Come on , man
guillermo My people got attacked .
guillermo Where's the compensation for their pain and suffering ?
guillermo More to the point , where's my bag of guns ?
rick_grimes Guns ?
guillermo The bag miguel saw in the street .
guillermo The bag felipe and Jorge were going back to get .
guillermo That bag of guns
rick_grimes You're mistaken
guillermo I don't think so
rick_grimes About It being yours .
rick_grimes It's my bag of guns
guillermo The bag was in the street .
guillermo Anybody could come around and say it was theirs .
guillermo I'm supposed to take your word ?
guillermo What's to stop my people from unloading on you right here and now
guillermo and I take what's mine ?
rick_grimes You could do that .
rick_grimes Or not
theodore_douglas Come on , man .
theodore_douglas Make the trade .
theodore_douglas Please
guillermo Oye I see two options .
guillermo You come back with miguel and my bag of guns , everybody walks .
guillermo Or you come back locked and loaded , we'll see which side spills more blood
daryl_dixon Them guns are worth more than gold .
daryl_dixon Gold won't protect your family or put food on the table .
daryl_dixon You're gonna give that up for that kid ?
theodore_douglas If I knew we'd get glenn back , I might agree .
theodore_douglas But you think that Vato across the way is just gonna hand him over ?
miguel You calling G a liar ?
daryl_dixon Are you apart of this ?
daryl_dixon You want to hold onto your teeth ?
theodore_douglas Question is , do you trust that man's word ?
daryl_dixon No , question is what are you willing to bet on it ?
daryl_dixon Could be more than them guns .
daryl_dixon Could be your life .
daryl_dixon glenn worth that to you ?
rick_grimes What life I have I owe to him .
rick_grimes I was nobody to Glenn , just some idiot stuck in a tank .
rick_grimes He could have walked away , but he didn't .
rick_grimes Neither will I
daryl_dixon So you're gonna hand the guns over ?
rick_grimes I didn't say that .
rick_grimes There's nothing keeping you two here .
rick_grimes You should get out , head back to camp
theodore_douglas And tell your family what ?
miguel Come on , this is nuts .
miguel Just do like g says
guillermo I see my guns
guillermo but they're not all in the bag
rick_grimes That's because they're not yours .
rick_grimes I thought I mentioned that
felipe Let's just shoot these fools right now , ese .
felipe All right ?
felipe Unload on their asses , ese
guillermo I don't think you fully appreciate the gravity of the situation
rick_grimes No , I'm pretty clear
rick_grimes You have your man .
rick_grimes I want mine
guillermo I'm gonna chop up your boy .
guillermo I'm gonna feed him to my dogs .
guillermo They're the evilest , nastiest man-eating bitches you ever saw .
guillermo I picked them up from Satan at a yard sale .
guillermo I told you how it has to be .
guillermo Are you woefully deaf ?
rick_grimes No , my hearing's fine .
rick_grimes You said come locked and loaded

rick_grimes You're the dumbest son of a bitch I ever met .
rick_grimes We walked in there ready to kill every last one of you
guillermo Well , I'm glad it didn't go down that way
rick_grimes If it had , that blood would be on my hands
guillermo Mine too .
guillermo We'd have fought back .
guillermo Wouldn't be the first time we've had to .
guillermo Protect the food , the medicine .

rick_grimes What are you doctors ?
guillermo Felipe's a nurse .
guillermo a special care provider .
guillermo Me , I'm the custodian
rick_grimes What about the rest of your crew ?
guillermo The Vatos trickle in to check on their parents , their grandparents .
guillermo They see how things are and most decide to stay .
guillermo It's a good thing too .
guillermo We need the muscle .
guillermo The people we've encountered since things fell apart , the worst kind .
guillermo plunderers , the kind that take by force
rick_grimes That's not who we are
guillermo How was I to know ?
guillermo My people got attacked and you show up with miguel hostage .
guillermo appearances
theodore_douglas Guess the world changed
guillermo No .
guillermo It's the same as it ever was .
guillermo The weak get taken .
guillermo So we do what we can here .
guillermo The Vatos work on those cars , talk about getting the old people out of the city .
guillermo But most can't even get to the bathroom by themselves , still , it keeps the crew busy , and that's worth something .
guillermo So we barred all the windows , welded all the doors shut except for one entrance .
guillermo The Vatos , they go out , scavenge what they can to keep us going .
guillermo We watch the perimeter night and day and we wait .
guillermo The people here , they all look to me now .
guillermo I don't even know why
rick_grimes Because they can
glenn_rhee Admit it , you only came back to Atlanta for the hat
rick_grimes Don't tell anybody
daryl_dixon You've given away half our guns and ammo
rick_grimes Not nearly half
daryl_dixon For what ?
daryl_dixon Bunch of old farts who are gonna die off momentarily
daryl_dixon anyhow ?
daryl_dixon Seriously , how long you think they got ?
rick_grimes How long do any of us ?
glenn_rhee Oh my god
daryl_dixon Where the hell's our van ?
glenn_rhee We left it right here .
glenn_rhee Who would take it ?
rick_grimes Merle
daryl_dixon He's gonna be taking some vengeance back to camp
andrea_harrison Wrapping paper , color tissue , anything ?
dale_horvath Seriously ?
andrea_harrison How can you not have anything ?
dale_horvath Had I been informed of the impending apocalypse I'd have stocked up
andrea_harrison It's Amy's birthday tomorrow .
andrea_harrison I've been marking days on the calendar just to make sure You don't give a gift unwrapped
dale_horvath Deep breath .
dale_horvath I'm sure I'll find something here
morales I , uh , built up the rocks all around .
morales See ?
morales So the flames can be a little higher and have 'em be hidden
shane_walsh Hey , Jim .
shane_walsh How you feeling , man ?
jim I'm better .
jim More myself now
shane_walsh I hope you understand the need for this .
shane_walsh this timeout .
shane_walsh I've got others I've got to think about .
shane_walsh I just want to make sure there's no .
shane_walsh there's no hard feelings

shane_walsh I miss this
morales I've got to ask you , man .
morales It's been driving me crazy
dale_horvath What ?
morales That watch
dale_horvath What's wrong with my watch ?
morales I see you every day , the same time , winding that thing like a village priest saying mass
jacqui I've wondered this myself
dale_horvath I'm missing the point
jacqui Unless I've misread the signs , the world seems to have come to an end .
jacqui At least hit a speed bump for a good long while
morales But there's you every day winding that stupid watch
dale_horvath Time .
dale_horvath it's important to keep track , isn't it ?
dale_horvath The days at least .
dale_horvath Don't you think , Andrea ?
dale_horvath Back me up here .
dale_horvath I like .
dale_horvath I like what , um , a father said to son when he gave him a watch that had been handed down through generations .
dale_horvath He said , " I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire , which will fit your individual needs no better than it did mine or my father's before me ; I give it to you not that you may remember time , but that you may forget it for a moment now and then and not spend all of your breath trying to conquer it "
amy_harrison You are so weird
dale_horvath It's not me .
dale_horvath It's Faulkner .

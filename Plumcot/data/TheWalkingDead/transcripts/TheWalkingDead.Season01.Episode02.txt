boy#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode02 Mom! -Right here 
lori_grimes Any luck?
amy_harrison How do we tell if they're poison?
lori_grimes Uh, there's only one sure way I know of
amy_harrison Ask shane when he gets back?
lori_grimes Yeah, you've got it
amy_harrison Thank you 
lori_grimes Dale, I'm heading out. Sweetheart, I want you to stay where dale can see you, okay?
carl_grimes Yes, mom
dale_horvath You too. Don't wander too far. Stay within shouting distance. And if you see anything, holler. I'll come running
lori_grimes Yes, mom  Contents 
shane_walsh Shh shh shh shh shh shh shh
lori_grimes You scared the hell out of me 
shane_walsh I bet. That's what you get for keeping me waiting. I was trying to be quiet. Where you been?
lori_grimes amy the Mushroom queen--I had to wait for her to get back 
shane_walsh How much time do we have?
lori_grimes Enough 
shane_walsh Come here
lori_grimes Okay 
glenn_rhee Hey, are you alive in there?
rick_grimes Hello? Hello?
glenn_rhee There you are. You had me wondering
rick_grimes Where are you? Outside? Can you see me right now?
glenn_rhee Yeah, I can see you. You're surrounded by walkers. That's the bad news
rick_grimes There's good news?
glenn_rhee No
rick_grimes Listen, whoever you are, I don't mind telling you I'm a little concerned in here
glenn_rhee Oh man. You should see it from over here. You'd be having a major freak-out
rick_grimes Got any advice for me?
glenn_rhee Yeah, I'd say make a run for it
rick_grimes That's it? "Make a run for it"?
glenn_rhee My way's not as dumb as it sounds. You've got eyes on the outside here. There's one geek still up on the tank but the others have climbed down and joined the feeding frenzy where the horse went down. With me so far?
rick_grimes So far
glenn_rhee Okay, the street on the other side of the tank is less crowded. If you move now while they're distracted, you stand a chance. Got ammo?
rick_grimes In that duffel bag I dropped out there, and guns. Can I get to it?
glenn_rhee Forget the bag, okay? It's not an option. What do you have on you?
rick_grimes Hang on rick has the Beretta 92FS that he took off of the Soldier, but it only has one clip.
rick_grimes Yeah. Yeah 
rick_grimes I've got a Beretta with one clip, 15 rounds
glenn_rhee Make 'em count. Jump off the right side of the tank, keep going in that direction. There's an alley up the street, maybe 50 yards. Be there
rick_grimes Hey, what's your name?
glenn_rhee Have you been listening? You're running out of time
rick_grimes Right 
rick_grimes Ah! 
glenn_rhee Whoa! Not dead! Come on! Come on! Back here! Come on! Come on! 
glenn_rhee What are you doing?! Come on! 
glenn_rhee Come on, get up 
glenn_rhee Nice moves there, Clint Eastwood. You the new sheriff come riding in to clean up the town? 
rick_grimes It wasn't my intention
glenn_rhee Yeah, whatever. Yeehaw. You're still a dumbass
rick_grimes Rick. Thanks
glenn_rhee Glenn. You're welcome. Oh no. The bright
side#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode02 It'll be the fall that kills us. I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy 
rick_grimes Are you the one that barricaded the alley?
glenn_rhee Somebody did. I guess when the city got overrun. Whoever did it was thinking not many geeks would get through
rick_grimes Back at the tank, why'd you stick your neck out for me?
glenn_rhee Call it foolish, naive hope that if I'm ever that far up sh1t creek, somebody might do the same for me. Guess I'm an even bigger dumbass than you  
glenn_rhee I'm back. Got a guest plus four geeks in the alley The two go down another staircase to a door where two Walkers appear. Two men, morales and T-Dog, come out with protective gear and baseball bats. They each go after one of the Walkers and bash their brains in.
glenn_rhee Lets go! 
theodore_douglas Morales, lets go!  
andrea_harrison You son of a bitch. We ought to kill you
morales Just chill out, Andrea. Back off
jacqui Come on, ease up
andrea_harrison Ease up? You're kidding me, right? We're dead because of this stupid asshole
morales Andrea, I said back the hell off. Well, pull the trigger
andrea_harrison We're dead--all of us--because of you
rick_grimes I don't understand
morales Look, we came into the city to scavenge supplies. You know what the key to scavenging is? Surviving! You know the key to surviving? Sneaking in and out, tiptoeing. Not shooting up the streets like it's the O. K. Corral
theodore_douglas Every geek for miles around heard you popping off rounds
andrea_harrison You just rang the dinner bell
morales Get the picture now? 
andrea_harrison Oh god. What the hell were you doing out there anyway?
rick_grimes Trying to flag the helicopter
theodore_douglas Helicopter? Man, that's crap. Ain't no damn helicopter
jacqui You were chasing a hallucination, imaging things it happens
rick_grimes I saw it
morales Hey, T-Dog, try that CB. Can you contact the others?
rick_grimes Others? The refugee center?
jacqui Yeah, the refugee center. They've got biscuits waiting at the oven for us 
theodore_douglas Got no signal. Maybe the roof 
andrea_harrison Oh no. Is that Dixon?
morales What is that maniac doing?
glenn_rhee Come on, let's go  
morales Hey, Dixon, are you crazy?! Dixon laughs and continues shooting.
andrea_harrison Oh jeez
merle_dixon Hey! Y'all be more polite to a man with a gun! Huh? Ah! Only common sense
theodore_douglas Man, you wasting bullets we ain't even got! 
theodore_douglas And you're bringing even more of them down on our ass! Man, just chill
merle_dixon Hey! Bad enough I've got this taco-bender on my ass all day. Now I'm gonna take orders from you? I don't think so, bro. That'll be the day
theodore_douglas "That'll be the day"? You got something you want to tell me?
morales Hey, t-dog man, just leave it
theodore_douglas No
morales All right? It ain't worth it. Now Merle, just relax, okay? We've got enough trouble
merle_dixon You want to know the day?
theodore_douglas Yeah
merle_dixon I'll tell you the day, Mr. "Yo. " It's the day I take orders from a nigger
theodore_douglas Mother-- 
morales Hey, come on, Merle. That's enough
andrea_harrison Come on. Dixon!
morales Whoa, cut it out, man!
andrea_harrison Stop it! Dixon, get off him! Dixon, you're gonna hurt him
morales Merle, cut it out! 
andrea_harrison No no no, please. Please 
merle_dixon Yeah! All right! We're gonna have ourselves a little powwow, huh? Talk about who's in charge. I vote me. Anybody else? Huh? Democracy time, y'all. Show of hands, huh?
andrea_harrison Come on.
merle_dixon All in favor? Huh? Let's see 'em. Oh, come on. All in favor? Yeah. That's good. Now that means I'm the boss, right? Yeah. Anybody else? Hmm? Anybody?
rick_grimes Yeah 
merle_dixon Who the hell are you, man?!
rick_grimes Officer friendly. Look here, Merle. Things are different now. There are no niggers anymore. No dumb-as-shit, inbred white-trash fools either. Only dark meat and white meat. There's us and the dead. We survive this by pulling together, not apart
merle_dixon Screw you, man
rick_grimes I can see you make a habit of missing the point
merle_dixon Yeah? Well, screw you twice
rick_grimes Ought to be polite to a with a gun 
rick_grimes Only common sense
merle_dixon You wouldn't. You're a cop
rick_grimes All I am anymore is a man looking for his wife and son. Anybody that gets in the way of that is gonna lose. I'll give you a moment to think about that. Got some on your nose there
merle_dixon What are you gonna do? Arrest me? 
merle_dixon Hey! What are you doing? Man, that was my stuff! Hey! If I get loose, you'd better pray. Yeah, you hear me, you pig?! You hear me?!
rick_grimes Yeah, your voice carries
merle_dixon Do you hear me, you filthy pig?!
morales You're not Atlanta P. D. Where you from?
rick_grimes Up the road a ways
morales Well, officer friendly from up the road a ways, welcome to the big city 
andrea_harrison God, it's like times square down there
morales How's that signal?
theodore_douglas Like Dixon's brain--weak
morales Keep trying
andrea_harrison Why? There's nothing they can do. Not a damn thing
morales Got some people outside the city is all. There's no refugee center. That's a pipe dream
rick_grimes Then she's right. We're on our own. It's up to us to find a way out
merle_dixon Good luck with that. These streets ain't safe in this part of town from what I hear. Ain't that right, sugar tits? Hey, honeybunch, what say you get me out of these cuffs, we go off somewhere and bump some uglies? Gonna die anyway
andrea_harrison I'd rather
merle_dixon Rug muncher. I figured as much
morales The streets aren't safe. Now there's an understatement
rick_grimes What about under the streets? The sewers?
morales Oh man. Hey, Glenn, check the alley. You see any manhole covers? 
glenn_rhee No, must be all out on the street where the geeks are
jacqui Maybe not. Old building like this built in the '20s. Big structures often had drainage tunnels into the sewers in case of flooding down in the subbasements
glenn_rhee How do you know that?
jacqui It's my job. was. I worked in the city zoning office 
morales This is it? Are you sure?
glenn_rhee I really scoped this place out the other times I was here. It's the only thing in the building that goes down. But I've never gone down it. Who'd want to, right? 
glenn_rhee Oh. Great
andrea_harrison We'll be right behind you
glenn_rhee No, you won't. Not you
andrea_harrison Why not me? Think I can't?
glenn_rhee I wasn't--
rick_grimes Speak your mind
glenn_rhee Look, until now I always came here by myself. In and out, grab a few things. No problem. The first time I bring a group. Everything goes to hell. No offense. If you want me to go down this gnarly hole, fine. But only if we do it my way. It's tight down there. If I run into something and have to get out quick, I don't want you all jammed up behind me getting me killed. I'll take one person. Not you either. You've got Merle's gun and I've seen you shoot. I'd feel better if you were out in that store watching those doors, covering our ass. And you've got the only other gun, so you should go with him. You be my wingman. jacqui stays here. Something happens, yell down to us, get us back up here in a hurry
jacqui Okay
rick_grimes Okay, everybody knows their jobs  
glenn_rhee Dah! 
andrea_harrison Sorry for the gun in your face
rick_grimes People do things when they're afraid
andrea_harrison Not that it was entirely unjustified. You did get us into this
rick_grimes If I get us out, would that make up for it?
andrea_harrison No, but It'd be a start
rick_grimes Next time though, take the safety off. It won't shoot otherwise
andrea_harrison Oh
rick_grimes Is that your gun?
andrea_harrison It was a gift. Why?
rick_grimes Little red dot means It's ready to fire 
rick_grimes You may have occasion to use it
andrea_harrison Good to know
theodore_douglas Anybody out there? Hello? Anybody read? I'm hoping to hear somebody's voice 'cause I'm getting sick and tired of hearing mine
merle_dixon Yeah, well, that makes two of us. Why don't you knock that crap off? You're giving me a headache, boy
theodore_douglas Why don't you pull your head out of your ass? Maybe your headache will go away 
theodore_douglas Try some positivity for a change. Damn
merle_dixon I'll tell you what. You get me out of these cuffs and I'll be all "Sammy Sunshine" positive for you. Hey, see that hacksaw over there in that toolbag? Get it for me, hmm? Make it worth your while. What do you say, man? Come on. Get me out of these things
theodore_douglas So you can beat my ass again? Or call me nigger some more?
merle_dixon Come on now. It wasn't personal. It's just that your kind and my kind ain't meant to mix. That's all. It doesn't mean we can't. Work together, parley, as long as there's some kind of mutual gain involved. So. about that hacksaw.
theodore_douglas I guess you want me to get that rifle over there too so you can shoot that cop when he comes back up, huh?
merle_dixon Huh 
morales Yeah, we've got ourselves. A sewer tunnel. jacqui was right
glenn_rhee Can we cut through it?
morales If we had a blowtorch and half a day, sure. Dale's hacksaw sure as hell won't do it 
andrea_harrison Oh rick spots andrea looking at some jewelry. He approaches her.
rick_grimes See something you like? 
andrea_harrison Not me, but I know someone who would. My sister. She's still such a kid in some ways. Unicorns, dragons. She's into all that stuff. But mermaids. They rule. She loves mermaids
rick_grimes Why not take it?
andrea_harrison There's a cop staring at me 
andrea_harrison Would it be considered looting?
rick_grimes I don't think those rules apply anymore. Do you? 
rick_grimes What did you find down there?
morales Not a way out
andrea_harrison We need to find a way. and soon 
rick_grimes That construction site, those trucks. They always keep keys on hand
morales You'll never make it past the walkers
rick_grimes You got me out of that tank
glenn_rhee Yeah, but they were feeding. They were distracted
rick_grimes Can we distract them again?
merle_dixon Right. Listen to him. He's onto something. A diversion, like on "Hogan's Heroes"
jacqui God. Give it a rest
rick_grimes They're drawn by sound, right?
glenn_rhee Right, like dogs. They hear a sound, they come
rick_grimes What else?
morales Aside from they hear you? They see you, smell you and if they catch you, they eat you
rick_grimes They can tell us by smell?
glenn_rhee Can't you?
andrea_harrison They smell dead, we don't. It's pretty distinct 
glenn_rhee If bad ideas were an Olympic event, this would take the gold
morales He's right. Just stop, okay? Take some time to think this through
rick_grimes How much time? They already got through one set of doors, that glass won't hold forever  
rick_grimes Wayne Dunlap. Georgia license. Born in 1979. He had $28 in his pocket when he died. And a picture of a pretty girl. "With love, from Rachel. " He used to be like us. Worrying about bills or the rent or the Super Bowl. If I ever find my family, I'm gonna tell them about Wayne
glenn_rhee One more thing--he was an organ donor 
andrea_harrison Oh!
morales Madre de dios! 
glenn_rhee Oh god
andrea_harrison Oh
morales Dios!
glenn_rhee Oh god
rick_grimes Keep chopping 
glenn_rhee I am so gonna hurl
rick_grimes Later 
rick_grimes Everybody got gloves? Don't get any on your skin or in your eyes 
glenn_rhee Oh God! Oh jeez. Oh, this is bad. This is really bad
rick_grimes Think about something else. Puppies and kittens
theodore_douglas Dead puppies and kittens 
andrea_harrison That is just evil. What is wrong with you?
jacqui Next time let the cracker beat his ass
theodore_douglas I'm sorry, yo
glenn_rhee You suck
rick_grimes Do we smell like them?
andrea_harrison Oh yeah. Glenn. Just in case 
rick_grimes If we make it back, be ready
theodore_douglas What about merle Dixon? 
rick_grimes Give me the axe. We need. we need more guts    
merle_dixon Hey, what's happening, man?
morales Hey, T-Dog, try that CB
merle_dixon Hey come on talk to me, y'all
theodore_douglas Base camp, this is T-Dog. Anybody hear me? Can anybody out there hear me?

theodore_douglas We're in some deep sh1t. We're trapped in the department store
shane_walsh He say they're trapped?
theodore_douglas There are geeks all over the place. Hundreds of 'em. We're surrounded
dale_horvath T-Dog, repeat that last. Repeat 
lori_grimes He said the department store
dale_horvath I heard it too
lori_grimes Shane?
shane_walsh No way. We do not go after them. We do not risk the rest of the group. Y'all know that
shane_walsh Look, Amy, I know that this is not easy--
amy_harrison She volunteered to go to help the rest of us
shane_walsh I know, and she knew the risks, right? See, if she's trapped, she's gone. So we just have to deal with that. There's nothing we can do
amy_harrison She's my sister, you son of a bitch lori looks at shane and then follows Amy.
lori_grimes Amy. 
shane_walsh Come on. It's all right, buddy 
glenn_rhee It's gonna work. I can't believe it
rick_grimes Don't draw attention  
morales Oh man. It's just a cloudburst. We get 'em all the time. It'll pass real quick

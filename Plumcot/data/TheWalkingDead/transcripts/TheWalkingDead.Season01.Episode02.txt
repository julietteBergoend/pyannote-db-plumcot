lori_grimes Any luck?
amy_harrison How do we tell if they're poison?
lori_grimes Uh, there's only one sure way I know of
amy_harrison Ask shane when he gets back?
lori_grimes Yeah, you've got it
amy_harrison Thank you She gets up.
lori_grimes Dale, I'm heading out. Sweetheart, I want you to stay where dale can see you, okay?
carl_grimes Yes, mom
dale_horvath You too. Don't wander too far. Stay within shouting distance. And if you see anything, holler. I'll come running
lori_grimes Yes, mom She goes into the woods to pick some more food for the camp. Contents While she is in the woods, leaves rustle. Bird wings flap, branch snaps. She starts to think that someone is following her. She worries that it is one of the Walkers and starts to look around. Suddenly, a hand reaches around her mouth and she is dragged back.
shane_walsh Shh shh shh shh shh shh shh
lori_grimes You scared the hell out of me lori laughs at him.
shane_walsh I bet. That's what you get for keeping me waiting. I was trying to be quiet. Where you been?
lori_grimes amy the Mushroom queen--I had to wait for her to get back They start kissing.
shane_walsh How much time do we have?
lori_grimes Enough The two are in the moment and proceed to make love. While undressing, they see lori still has Rick's ring around her neck on a necklace. She takes it off and holds onto it in the grass while they proceed.
shane_walsh Come here
lori_grimes Okay In Atlanta, rick is still sitting in the tank when the voice is heard on the radio again.
glenn_rhee Hey, are you alive in there?
rick_grimes Hello? Hello?
glenn_rhee There you are. You had me wondering
rick_grimes Where are you? Outside? Can you see me right now?
glenn_rhee Yeah, I can see you. You're surrounded by walkers. That's the bad news
rick_grimes There's good news?
glenn_rhee No
rick_grimes Listen, whoever you are, I don't mind telling you I'm a little concerned in here
glenn_rhee Oh man. You should see it from over here. You'd be having a major freak-out
rick_grimes Got any advice for me?
glenn_rhee Yeah, I'd say make a run for it
rick_grimes That's it? "Make a run for it"?
glenn_rhee My way's not as dumb as it sounds. You've got eyes on the outside here. There's one geek still up on the tank but the others have climbed down and joined the feeding frenzy where the horse went down. With me so far?
rick_grimes So far
glenn_rhee Okay, the street on the other side of the tank is less crowded. If you move now while they're distracted, you stand a chance. Got ammo?
rick_grimes In that duffel bag I dropped out there, and guns. Can I get to it?
glenn_rhee Forget the bag, okay? It's not an option. What do you have on you?
rick_grimes Hang on rick has the Beretta 92FS that he took off of the Soldier, but it only has one clip.
rick_grimes Yeah. Yeah He also finds a grenade, but he clips it onto his belt and doesn't tell the man about it.
rick_grimes I've got a Beretta with one clip, 15 rounds
glenn_rhee Make 'em count. Jump off the right side of the tank, keep going in that direction. There's an alley up the street, maybe 50 yards. Be there
rick_grimes Hey, what's your name?
glenn_rhee Have you been listening? You're running out of time
rick_grimes Right rick makes his break after grabbing a metal shard in the tank. He opens the top and whacks the Walker on the tank with the metal shard, slicing its face wide open.
rick_grimes Ah! He runs down the street, firing at any Walker in his way, killing 8 of them. He comes across the man whose been talking to him.
glenn_rhee Whoa! Not dead! Come on! Come on! Back here! Come on! Come on! The two proceed to run down the alley and start climbing up a ladder.
glenn_rhee What are you doing?! Come on! rick climbs up the ladder.
glenn_rhee Come on, get up Both pant.
glenn_rhee Nice moves there, Clint Eastwood. You the new sheriff come riding in to clean up the town? glenn says that he hopes that rick would do the same for him one day.
rick_grimes It wasn't my intention
glenn_rhee Yeah, whatever. Yeehaw. You're still a dumbass
rick_grimes Rick. Thanks
glenn_rhee Glenn. You're welcome. Oh no. The bright
side#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode02 It'll be the fall that kills us. I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy The two climb up the ladder that leads to the top of a store that glenn is camping out at.
rick_grimes Are you the one that barricaded the alley?
glenn_rhee Somebody did. I guess when the city got overrun. Whoever did it was thinking not many geeks would get through
rick_grimes Back at the tank, why'd you stick your neck out for me?
glenn_rhee Call it foolish, naive hope that if I'm ever that far up sh1t creek, somebody might do the same for me. Guess I'm an even bigger dumbass than you glenn takes another ladder and goes down, following by Rick. It leads to the building. glenn takes out a walkie-talkie.
glenn_rhee I'm back. Got a guest plus four geeks in the alley The two go down another staircase to a door where two Walkers appear. Two men, morales and T-Dog, come out with protective gear and baseball bats. They each go after one of the Walkers and bash their brains in.
glenn_rhee Lets go! rick and glenn make their way into the store.
theodore_douglas Morales, lets go! t-dog and morales follow after they finish the Walkers. They get inside where two more survivors, jacqui and andrea are also taking cover. rick immediately has a gun pointed in his face by Andrea.
andrea_harrison You son of a bitch. We ought to kill you
morales Just chill out, Andrea. Back off
jacqui Come on, ease up
andrea_harrison Ease up? You're kidding me, right? We're dead because of this stupid asshole
morales Andrea, I said back the hell off. Well, pull the trigger
andrea_harrison We're dead--all of us--because of you
rick_grimes I don't understand
morales Look, we came into the city to scavenge supplies. You know what the key to scavenging is? Surviving! You know the key to surviving? Sneaking in and out, tiptoeing. Not shooting up the streets like it's the O. K. Corral
theodore_douglas Every geek for miles around heard you popping off rounds
andrea_harrison You just rang the dinner bell
morales Get the picture now? They see the zombies growling and trying to get into the store. A few Walkers is attempting to smash through the double set of doors to get to them.
andrea_harrison Oh god. What the hell were you doing out there anyway?
rick_grimes Trying to flag the helicopter
theodore_douglas Helicopter? Man, that's crap. Ain't no damn helicopter
jacqui You were chasing a hallucination, imaging things it happens
rick_grimes I saw it
morales Hey, T-Dog, try that CB. Can you contact the others?
rick_grimes Others? The refugee center?
jacqui Yeah, the refugee center. They've got biscuits waiting at the oven for us t-dog tries to get in contact with some other survivors but get no signal.
theodore_douglas Got no signal. Maybe the roof Above, on the roof, they hear a gun firing.
andrea_harrison Oh no. Is that Dixon?
morales What is that maniac doing?
glenn_rhee Come on, let's go The group runs up to the roof. merle Dixon is shooting at several of the Walkers on the street below with a sniper rifle, killing some of them.
morales Hey, Dixon, are you crazy?! Dixon laughs and continues shooting.
andrea_harrison Oh jeez
merle_dixon Hey! Y'all be more polite to a man with a gun! Huh? Ah! Only common sense
theodore_douglas Man, you wasting bullets we ain't even got! merle continues laughing.
theodore_douglas And you're bringing even more of them down on our ass! Man, just chill
merle_dixon Hey! Bad enough I've got this taco-bender on my ass all day. Now I'm gonna take orders from you? I don't think so, bro. That'll be the day
theodore_douglas "That'll be the day"? You got something you want to tell me?
morales Hey, t-dog man, just leave it
theodore_douglas No
morales All right? It ain't worth it. Now Merle, just relax, okay? We've got enough trouble
merle_dixon You want to know the day?
theodore_douglas Yeah
merle_dixon I'll tell you the day, Mr. "Yo. " It's the day I take orders from a nigger
theodore_douglas Mother-- merle and t-dog start to fight.
morales Hey, come on, Merle. That's enough
andrea_harrison Come on. Dixon!
morales Whoa, cut it out, man!
andrea_harrison Stop it! Dixon, get off him! Dixon, you're gonna hurt him
morales Merle, cut it out! merle is beating t-dog to a pulp and then holds a pistol on him.
andrea_harrison No no no, please. Please Everybody waits to see what Dixon is gonna do.
merle_dixon Yeah! All right! We're gonna have ourselves a little powwow, huh? Talk about who's in charge. I vote me. Anybody else? Huh? Democracy time, y'all. Show of hands, huh?
andrea_harrison Come on.
merle_dixon All in favor? Huh? Let's see 'em. Oh, come on. All in favor? Yeah. That's good. Now that means I'm the boss, right? Yeah. Anybody else? Hmm? Anybody?
rick_grimes Yeah At this time, rick hits merle over the head with a pipe. He proceeds to handcuff merle to a pipe.
merle_dixon Who the hell are you, man?!
rick_grimes Officer friendly. Look here, Merle. Things are different now. There are no niggers anymore. No dumb-as-shit, inbred white-trash fools either. Only dark meat and white meat. There's us and the dead. We survive this by pulling together, not apart
merle_dixon Screw you, man
rick_grimes I can see you make a habit of missing the point
merle_dixon Yeah? Well, screw you twice
rick_grimes Ought to be polite to a with a gun rick cocks his gun.
rick_grimes Only common sense
merle_dixon You wouldn't. You're a cop
rick_grimes All I am anymore is a man looking for his wife and son. Anybody that gets in the way of that is gonna lose. I'll give you a moment to think about that. Got some on your nose there
merle_dixon What are you gonna do? Arrest me? Dixon laughs.
merle_dixon Hey! What are you doing? Man, that was my stuff! Hey! If I get loose, you'd better pray. Yeah, you hear me, you pig?! You hear me?!
rick_grimes Yeah, your voice carries
merle_dixon Do you hear me, you filthy pig?!
morales You're not Atlanta P. D. Where you from?
rick_grimes Up the road a ways
morales Well, officer friendly from up the road a ways, welcome to the big city Later, they're still watching the Walkers in the street.
andrea_harrison God, it's like times square down there
morales How's that signal?
theodore_douglas Like Dixon's brain--weak
morales Keep trying
andrea_harrison Why? There's nothing they can do. Not a damn thing
morales Got some people outside the city is all. There's no refugee center. That's a pipe dream
rick_grimes Then she's right. We're on our own. It's up to us to find a way out
merle_dixon Good luck with that. These streets ain't safe in this part of town from what I hear. Ain't that right, sugar tits? Hey, honeybunch, what say you get me out of these cuffs, we go off somewhere and bump some uglies? Gonna die anyway
andrea_harrison I'd rather
merle_dixon Rug muncher. I figured as much
morales The streets aren't safe. Now there's an understatement
rick_grimes What about under the streets? The sewers?
morales Oh man. Hey, Glenn, check the alley. You see any manhole covers? glenn checks but sees only some Walkers.
glenn_rhee No, must be all out on the street where the geeks are
jacqui Maybe not. Old building like this built in the '20s. Big structures often had drainage tunnels into the sewers in case of flooding down in the subbasements
glenn_rhee How do you know that?
jacqui It's my job. was. I worked in the city zoning office The group heads down to the basement and reach a sewer entrance.
morales This is it? Are you sure?
glenn_rhee I really scoped this place out the other times I was here. It's the only thing in the building that goes down. But I've never gone down it. Who'd want to, right? Everybody look at him.
glenn_rhee Oh. Great
andrea_harrison We'll be right behind you
glenn_rhee No, you won't. Not you
andrea_harrison Why not me? Think I can't?
glenn_rhee I wasn't--
rick_grimes Speak your mind
glenn_rhee Look, until now I always came here by myself. In and out, grab a few things. No problem. The first time I bring a group. Everything goes to hell. No offense. If you want me to go down this gnarly hole, fine. But only if we do it my way. It's tight down there. If I run into something and have to get out quick, I don't want you all jammed up behind me getting me killed. I'll take one person. Not you either. You've got Merle's gun and I've seen you shoot. I'd feel better if you were out in that store watching those doors, covering our ass. And you've got the only other gun, so you should go with him. You be my wingman. jacqui stays here. Something happens, yell down to us, get us back up here in a hurry
jacqui Okay
rick_grimes Okay, everybody knows their jobs glenn leads down the ladder, followed by Morales. The others leave. glenn and morales walk. A rat squeals and glenn makes a noise.
glenn_rhee Dah! While Walkers are banging and growling, rick approaches Andrea.
andrea_harrison Sorry for the gun in your face
rick_grimes People do things when they're afraid
andrea_harrison Not that it was entirely unjustified. You did get us into this
rick_grimes If I get us out, would that make up for it?
andrea_harrison No, but It'd be a start
rick_grimes Next time though, take the safety off. It won't shoot otherwise
andrea_harrison Oh
rick_grimes Is that your gun?
andrea_harrison It was a gift. Why?
rick_grimes Little red dot means It's ready to fire He shows her and hands her back the gun.
rick_grimes You may have occasion to use it
andrea_harrison Good to know
theodore_douglas Anybody out there? Hello? Anybody read? I'm hoping to hear somebody's voice 'cause I'm getting sick and tired of hearing mine
merle_dixon Yeah, well, that makes two of us. Why don't you knock that crap off? You're giving me a headache, boy
theodore_douglas Why don't you pull your head out of your ass? Maybe your headache will go away merle chuckles.
theodore_douglas Try some positivity for a change. Damn
merle_dixon I'll tell you what. You get me out of these cuffs and I'll be all "Sammy Sunshine" positive for you. Hey, see that hacksaw over there in that toolbag? Get it for me, hmm? Make it worth your while. What do you say, man? Come on. Get me out of these things
theodore_douglas So you can beat my ass again? Or call me nigger some more?
merle_dixon Come on now. It wasn't personal. It's just that your kind and my kind ain't meant to mix. That's all. It doesn't mean we can't. Work together, parley, as long as there's some kind of mutual gain involved. So. about that hacksaw.
theodore_douglas I guess you want me to get that rifle over there too so you can shoot that cop when he comes back up, huh?
merle_dixon Huh In the sewers, glenn and morales continue to look for a way out through the sewers. They reach a grate and wonder if they can break through.
morales Yeah, we've got ourselves. A sewer tunnel. jacqui was right
glenn_rhee Can we cut through it?
morales If we had a blowtorch and half a day, sure. Dale's hacksaw sure as hell won't do it A Walker appears at the grate eating a rat. glenn and morales jump back as the Walker tries to grab at them.
andrea_harrison Oh rick spots andrea looking at some jewelry. He approaches her.
rick_grimes See something you like? andrea looks at a mermaid necklace on the counter.
andrea_harrison Not me, but I know someone who would. My sister. She's still such a kid in some ways. Unicorns, dragons. She's into all that stuff. But mermaids. They rule. She loves mermaids
rick_grimes Why not take it?
andrea_harrison There's a cop staring at me rick chuckles.
andrea_harrison Would it be considered looting?
rick_grimes I don't think those rules apply anymore. Do you? Glass shatters and Walkers start walking in. rick moves and is willing to shoot. glenn and morales join them.
rick_grimes What did you find down there?
morales Not a way out
andrea_harrison We need to find a way. and soon rick spots a truck at a construction site that is close to their location.
rick_grimes That construction site, those trucks. They always keep keys on hand
morales You'll never make it past the walkers
rick_grimes You got me out of that tank
glenn_rhee Yeah, but they were feeding. They were distracted
rick_grimes Can we distract them again?
merle_dixon Right. Listen to him. He's onto something. A diversion, like on "Hogan's Heroes"
jacqui God. Give it a rest
rick_grimes They're drawn by sound, right?
glenn_rhee Right, like dogs. They hear a sound, they come
rick_grimes What else?
morales Aside from they hear you? They see you, smell you and if they catch you, they eat you
rick_grimes They can tell us by smell?
glenn_rhee Can't you?
andrea_harrison They smell dead, we don't. It's pretty distinct rick gives outfits and accessories to the others.
glenn_rhee If bad ideas were an Olympic event, this would take the gold
morales He's right. Just stop, okay? Take some time to think this through
rick_grimes How much time? They already got through one set of doors, that glass won't hold forever The group goes outside and drags one of the Walkers they killed into the store. rick grabs a fire axe and the group puts on trench coats so they don't get guts on their good clothes. rick is prepared to start chopping, but he stops at the last moment. He gets down and searches the Walker. He pulls out a wallet.
rick_grimes Wayne Dunlap. Georgia license. Born in 1979. He had $28 in his pocket when he died. And a picture of a pretty girl. "With love, from Rachel. " He used to be like us. Worrying about bills or the rent or the Super Bowl. If I ever find my family, I'm gonna tell them about Wayne
glenn_rhee One more thing--he was an organ donor After a moment of silence, rick starts to hack away at the Walker. The guts really gross everyone out and they start to gag.
andrea_harrison Oh!
morales Madre de dios! -Oh! God! Gack!
glenn_rhee Oh god
andrea_harrison Oh
morales Dios!
glenn_rhee Oh god
rick_grimes Keep chopping rick hands the axe to Morales. glenn groans.
glenn_rhee I am so gonna hurl
rick_grimes Later morales hacks away.
rick_grimes Everybody got gloves? Don't get any on your skin or in your eyes They apply some guts on rick and Glenn.
glenn_rhee Oh God! Oh jeez. Oh, this is bad. This is really bad
rick_grimes Think about something else. Puppies and kittens
theodore_douglas Dead puppies and kittens glenn vomits.
andrea_harrison That is just evil. What is wrong with you?
jacqui Next time let the cracker beat his ass
theodore_douglas I'm sorry, yo
glenn_rhee You suck
rick_grimes Do we smell like them?
andrea_harrison Oh yeah. Glenn. Just in case andrea gives the gun to Glenn.
rick_grimes If we make it back, be ready
theodore_douglas What about merle Dixon? rick tosses the handcuff key to T-Dog.
rick_grimes Give me the axe. We need. we need more guts -Oh god! rick starts to chop again. rick and glenn walk outside and walk past two Walkers that are close to them. The Walkers briefly look at them, but the Walkers smell dead on them so they don't bother. rick and glenn crawl under a bus and come out on the other side where a huge hoard of Walkers is waiting for them. rick and glenn continue to shuffle through the crowd without any Walkers noticing that they are alive. The survival group enters and looks down at the Walkers, glenn and Rick.
merle_dixon Hey, what's happening, man?
morales Hey, T-Dog, try that CB
merle_dixon Hey come on talk to me, y'all
theodore_douglas Base camp, this is T-Dog. Anybody hear me? Can anybody out there hear me? morales notices glenn and Rick.
morales There Thunder rumbles.
merle_dixon That asshole is out on the street with the handcuff keys? t-dog shows him the key he has. dale is fixing up the mobile home.
dale_horvath Boy, that hose isn't long for this world, is it?
jim No sir
dale_horvath Where the hell are we gonna find a replacement?
amy_harrison It's late. They should've been back by now
dale_horvath Worrying won't make it better shane is playing with Carl, while lori stares at them.
shane_walsh Attaboy
carl_grimes Yeah
shane_walsh And three, two, one--pull it
carl_grimes Ah! Aw Both laugh.
shane_walsh Start it over. Make your "p" the other way. around your finger
carl_grimes Oops
shane_walsh Good, just tie it like around your finger. Attaboy Radio squawks.
theodore_douglas Hello, base camp! Can anybody out there hear me? Base camp, this is T-Dog. Anybody hear me? dale takes the radio.
dale_horvath Hello? Hello? Reception's bad on this end. Repeat. Repeat
theodore_douglas Shane, is that you?
lori_grimes Is that them?
theodore_douglas We're in some deep sh1t. We're trapped in the department store
shane_walsh He say they're trapped?
theodore_douglas There are geeks all over the place. Hundreds of 'em. We're surrounded
dale_horvath T-Dog, repeat that last. Repeat Radio stops.
lori_grimes He said the department store
dale_horvath I heard it too
lori_grimes Shane?
shane_walsh No way. We do not go after them. We do not risk the rest of the group. Y'all know that
shane_walsh Look, Amy, I know that this is not easy--
amy_harrison She volunteered to go to help the rest of us
shane_walsh I know, and she knew the risks, right? See, if she's trapped, she's gone. So we just have to deal with that. There's nothing we can do
amy_harrison She's my sister, you son of a bitch lori looks at shane and then follows Amy.
lori_grimes Amy. Thunder rumbles.
shane_walsh Come on. It's all right, buddy glenn and rick are still walking through several Walkers.
glenn_rhee It's gonna work. I can't believe it
rick_grimes Don't draw attention While rick and glenn continue to shuffle down the street, rain starts to fall on them. morales and the others are still watching rick and Glenn.
morales Oh man. It's just a cloudburst. We get 'em all the time. It'll pass real quick rick and glenn try not to panic as they continue to walk at the normal pace. They notice that the rain is starting to wash of the guts. The Walkers are starting to get a whiff of life walking past them and they start to get a little more aggressive towards rick and glenn as they try to figure out if they are dead or alive.
glenn_rhee The smell's washing off. Isn't it? Is it washing off?
rick_grimes No, It's not. Well, maybe However, as more guts wash off, the Walkers realize that they are indeed alive. One of them starts to charge at them and rick proceeds to crush its skull with the axe.
rick_grimes Run! rick and glenn take off down the street with rick killing 6 more with the axe and glenn killing 2 with a crowbar he has.
morales Come on, come on, come on The two throw their weapons over the fence and climb over it before the Walkers are able to get them. While glenn finds the keys to the truck, rick pulls Merle's pistol and kills more Walkers with it. glenn finally finds the keys to the truck and throws them to Rick.
glenn_rhee Rick! They enter the truck as some Walkers start climbing over the fence and running after them. One of them reaches the truck and taps on Glenn's window.
glenn_rhee Go go go go! The two speed away before the walkers catch up.
andrea_harrison They're leaving us
merle_dixon What? What?
morales Where they going? Where they going?
andrea_harrison No no, come back
glenn_rhee Oh my God. Oh my God. They're all over that place
rick_grimes You need to draw them away. Those roll-up doors at the front of the store. That area? That's what I need cleared. Raise your friends. Tell them to get down there and be ready
glenn_rhee And I'm drawing the geeks away how? I--I missed that part
rick_grimes Noise rick pulls up next to a red sports car and smashes the window. The car alarm starts to sound and rick hotwires the car for Glenn. glenn drives the sports car back towards the store and rick takes the truck back as well.
glenn_rhee Those roll-up doors at the front of the store facing the street. Meet us there and be ready The group heads down towards the loading dock to make their escape, whereas Dixon is still handcuffed.
morales Come on! Let's go, let's go!
merle_dixon Hey, you can't leave me here! I'm not fooling, man! Morales! Hey, man! Don't do this!
andrea_harrison Come on andrea and jacqui leave the roof.
merle_dixon Hey, that's my gun. You can't leave me. Don't leave me here, you guys
andrea_harrison Morales, come on
morales I'm coming! We've gotta go! morales leaves the roof, while t-dog is hesitating.
merle_dixon Morales! You can't leave me like this, man! Hey, T-Dog. No, man. You can't leave me, man. You can't leave me here. Not like this. You can't, man. It's not human. Come on, don't do this t-dog groans, but decides to free Dixon.
merle_dixon Come on, T. Come on! Come on, yeah! Yeah! Come on! Co. That's it! Yes! Come on, baby! Come on However, when he runs back towards Merle, he trips. The handcuff key falls out of his hand and ends up dropping down a drain. Zombies bangs as andrea and morales past by.
morales Go
merle_dixon Son of a bitch! You did that on purpose!
theodore_douglas I didn't mean to!
merle_dixon You lie! You did it on purpose!
theodore_douglas It was an accident!
merle_dixon Don't leave me, man! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! You liar!
theodore_douglas I'm sorry. Man, I'm sorry
merle_dixon Don't leave me!
theodore_douglas I'm sorry He runs from Merle.
merle_dixon Damn you all! Don't leave me, man! Don't leave. don't leave me!
theodore_douglas Ah! In an effort to try and help Merle, he chains the door to the roof shut.
merle_dixon Hey! What are you doing, man? You're gonna rot in hell! You're gonna rot in hell! Come back, man!
theodore_douglas Wait a minute! Here I come!
merle_dixon Don't leave me! Don't leave! The rest of the survivors make it to the loading dock.
andrea_harrison Okay. Okay. I got it
morales Shh
andrea_harrison What is that? Car engine revs.
glenn_rhee Come on. Come on. Get closer. Get closer. Come on. Come on glenn pulls up to the store in his red sports car and is able to lure most of the Walkers away from the store. Zombies start growling. t-dog joins the rest of the survivors just in time before the Walkers break through the second set of doors and storm the store. Thanks to Glenn, rick has the chance to pull in with his truck.
theodore_douglas Hey, wait for me! Walkers enter the store.
theodore_douglas They're here! Let's go! They're in here! rick bangs on the door. Morales, Jacqui, andrea and
theodore_douglas Let's go! Open the door!
theodore_douglas We've gotta go! -Go! rick picks up Morales, Jacqui, Andrea, and T-Dog.
morales I'm in! morales closes the back before the Walkers can get to them and the group makes their escape. merle is still handcuffed to the pipe on the roof.
merle_dixon Don't leave me! You'll die! Go to hell! Damn you! You're gonna rot in hell! merle keeps yelling. As they drive away, everyone notices Dixon is missing.
theodore_douglas I dropped the damn key Realizing there is nothing that they can do, the group drives away from Atlanta. andrea notices glenn isn't around.
andrea_harrison Where's Glenn? Down the highway that rick entered Atlanta in, the car alarm still ringing as glenn speeds down the highway in the red sports car. He is listening to music and screaming at the rush of driving down the road this fast.
glenn_rhee Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah-hoo-hoo! glenn is driving down the road.

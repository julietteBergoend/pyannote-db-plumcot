Mom! -right here 
Any luck?
How do we tell if they're poison?
Uh, there's only one sure way i know of
Ask shane when he gets back?
Yeah, you've got it
Thank you 
Dale, i'm heading out. sweetheart, i want you to stay where dale can see you, okay?
Yes, mom
You too. don't wander too far. stay within shouting distance. and if you see anything, holler. i'll come running
Yes, mom  contents 
Shh shh shh shh shh shh shh
You scared the hell out of me 
I bet. that's what you get for keeping me waiting. i was trying to be quiet. where you been?
Amy the mushroom queen--i had to wait for her to get back 
How much time do we have?
Enough 
Come here
Okay 
Hey, are you alive in there?
Hello? hello?
There you are. you had me wondering
Where are you? outside? can you see me right now?
Yeah, i can see you. you're surrounded by walkers. that's the bad news
There's good news?
No
Listen, whoever you are, i don't mind telling you i'm a little concerned in here
Oh man. you should see it from over here. you'd be having a major freak-out
Got any advice for me?
Yeah, i'd say make a run for it
That's it? "make a run for it"?
My way's not as dumb as it sounds. you've got eyes on the outside here. there's one geek still up on the tank but the others have climbed down and joined the feeding frenzy where the horse went down. with me so far?
So far
Okay, the street on the other side of the tank is less crowded. if you move now while they're distracted, you stand a chance. got ammo?
In that duffel bag i dropped out there, and guns. can i get to it?
Forget the bag, okay? it's not an option. what do you have on you?
Hang on rick has the beretta 92fs that he took off of the soldier, but it only has one clip.
Yeah. yeah 
I've got a beretta with one clip, 15 rounds
Make 'em count. jump off the right side of the tank, keep going in that direction. there's an alley up the street, maybe 50 yards. be there
Hey, what's your name?
Have you been listening? you're running out of time
Right 
Ah! 
Whoa! not dead! come on! come on! back here! come on! come on! 
What are you doing?! come on! 
Come on, get up 
Nice moves there, clint eastwood. you the new sheriff come riding in to clean up the town? 
It wasn't my intention
Yeah, whatever. yeehaw. you're still a dumbass
Rick. thanks
Glenn. you're welcome. oh no. the bright
It'll be the fall that kills us. i'm a glass-half-full kind of guy 
Are you the one that barricaded the alley?
Somebody did. i guess when the city got overrun. whoever did it was thinking not many geeks would get through
Back at the tank, why'd you stick your neck out for me?
Call it foolish, naive hope that if i'm ever that far up sh1t creek, somebody might do the same for me. guess i'm an even bigger dumbass than you  
I'm back. got a guest plus four geeks in the alley the two go down another staircase to a door where two walkers appear. two men, morales and t-dog, come out with protective gear and baseball bats. they each go after one of the walkers and bash their brains in.
Lets go! 
Morales, lets go!  
You son of a bitch. we ought to kill you
Just chill out, andrea. back off
Come on, ease up
Ease up? you're kidding me, right? we're dead because of this stupid asshole
Andrea, i said back the hell off. well, pull the trigger
We're dead--all of us--because of you
I don't understand
Look, we came into the city to scavenge supplies. you know what the key to scavenging is? surviving! you know the key to surviving? sneaking in and out, tiptoeing. not shooting up the streets like it's the o. k. corral
Every geek for miles around heard you popping off rounds
You just rang the dinner bell
Get the picture now? 
Oh god. what the hell were you doing out there anyway?
Trying to flag the helicopter
Helicopter? man, that's crap. ain't no damn helicopter
You were chasing a hallucination, imaging things it happens
I saw it
Hey, t-dog, try that cb. can you contact the others?
Others? the refugee center?
Yeah, the refugee center. they've got biscuits waiting at the oven for us 
Got no signal. maybe the roof 
Oh no. is that dixon?
What is that maniac doing?
Come on, let's go  
Hey, dixon, are you crazy?! dixon laughs and continues shooting.
Oh jeez
Hey! y'all be more polite to a man with a gun! huh? ah! only common sense
Man, you wasting bullets we ain't even got! 
And you're bringing even more of them down on our ass! man, just chill
Hey! bad enough i've got this taco-bender on my ass all day. now i'm gonna take orders from you? i don't think so, bro. that'll be the day
"that'll be the day"? you got something you want to tell me?
Hey, t-dog man, just leave it
No
All right? it ain't worth it. now merle, just relax, okay? we've got enough trouble
You want to know the day?
Yeah
I'll tell you the day, mr. "yo. " it's the day i take orders from a nigger
Mother-- 
Hey, come on, merle. that's enough
Come on. dixon!
Whoa, cut it out, man!
Stop it! dixon, get off him! dixon, you're gonna hurt him
Merle, cut it out! 
No no no, please. please 
Yeah! all right! we're gonna have ourselves a little powwow, huh? talk about who's in charge. i vote me. anybody else? huh? democracy time, y'all. show of hands, huh?
Come on.
All in favor? huh? let's see 'em. oh, come on. all in favor? yeah. that's good. now that means i'm the boss, right? yeah. anybody else? hmm? anybody?
Yeah 
Who the hell are you, man?!
Officer friendly. look here, merle. things are different now. there are no niggers anymore. no dumb-as-shit, inbred white-trash fools either. only dark meat and white meat. there's us and the dead. we survive this by pulling together, not apart
Screw you, man
I can see you make a habit of missing the point
Yeah? well, screw you twice
Ought to be polite to a with a gun 
Only common sense
You wouldn't. you're a cop
All i am anymore is a man looking for his wife and son. anybody that gets in the way of that is gonna lose. i'll give you a moment to think about that. got some on your nose there
What are you gonna do? arrest me? 
Hey! what are you doing? man, that was my stuff! hey! if i get loose, you'd better pray. yeah, you hear me, you pig?! you hear me?!
Yeah, your voice carries
Do you hear me, you filthy pig?!
You're not atlanta p. d. where you from?
Up the road a ways
Well, officer friendly from up the road a ways, welcome to the big city 
God, it's like times square down there
How's that signal?
Like dixon's brain--weak
Keep trying
Why? there's nothing they can do. not a damn thing
Got some people outside the city is all. there's no refugee center. that's a pipe dream
Then she's right. we're on our own. it's up to us to find a way out
Good luck with that. these streets ain't safe in this part of town from what i hear. ain't that right, sugar tits? hey, honeybunch, what say you get me out of these cuffs, we go off somewhere and bump some uglies? gonna die anyway
I'd rather
Rug muncher. i figured as much
The streets aren't safe. now there's an understatement
What about under the streets? the sewers?
Oh man. hey, glenn, check the alley. you see any manhole covers? 
No, must be all out on the street where the geeks are
Maybe not. old building like this built in the '20s. big structures often had drainage tunnels into the sewers in case of flooding down in the subbasements
How do you know that?
It's my job. was. i worked in the city zoning office 
This is it? are you sure?
I really scoped this place out the other times i was here. it's the only thing in the building that goes down. but i've never gone down it. who'd want to, right? 
Oh. great
We'll be right behind you
No, you won't. not you
Why not me? think i can't?
I wasn't--
Speak your mind
Look, until now i always came here by myself. in and out, grab a few things. no problem. the first time i bring a group. everything goes to hell. no offense. if you want me to go down this gnarly hole, fine. but only if we do it my way. it's tight down there. if i run into something and have to get out quick, i don't want you all jammed up behind me getting me killed. i'll take one person. not you either. you've got merle's gun and i've seen you shoot. i'd feel better if you were out in that store watching those doors, covering our ass. and you've got the only other gun, so you should go with him. you be my wingman. jacqui stays here. something happens, yell down to us, get us back up here in a hurry

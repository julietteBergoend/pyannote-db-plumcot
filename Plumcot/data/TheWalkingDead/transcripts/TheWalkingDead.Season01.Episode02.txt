morales You see any manhole covers ?
glenn_rhee No , must be all out on the street where the geeks are

jacqui It's my job .
jacqui was .
jacqui I worked in the city zoning office
morales This is it ?

glenn_rhee The first time I bring a group .
glenn_rhee Everything goes to hell .
glenn_rhee No offense .
glenn_rhee If you want me to go down this gnarly hole , fine .
glenn_rhee But only if we do it my way .
glenn_rhee It's tight down there .
glenn_rhee If I run into something and have to get out quick , I don't want you all jammed up behind me getting me killed .
glenn_rhee I'll take one person .
glenn_rhee Not you either .
glenn_rhee You've got Merle's gun
glenn_rhee and I've seen you shoot .
glenn_rhee I'd feel better if you were out in that store watching those doors , covering our ass .
glenn_rhee And you've got the only other gun , so you should go with him .
glenn_rhee You be my wingman .
glenn_rhee jacqui stays here .
glenn_rhee Something happens , yell down to us , get us back up here in a hurry
jacqui Okay
rick_grimes Okay , everybody knows their jobs
glenn_rhee Dah !
andrea_harrison Sorry for the gun in your face
rick_grimes People do things when they're afraid
andrea_harrison Not that it was entirely unjustified .
andrea_harrison You did get us into this
rick_grimes If I get us out , would that make up for it ?
andrea_harrison No , but It'd be a start
rick_grimes Next time though , take the safety off .
rick_grimes It won't shoot otherwise
andrea_harrison Oh
rick_grimes Is that your gun ?
andrea_harrison It was a gift .
andrea_harrison Why ?
rick_grimes Little red dot means It's ready to fire

merle_dixon Why don't you knock that crap off ?
merle_dixon You're giving me a headache , boy
theodore_douglas Why don't you pull your head out of your ass ?
theodore_douglas Maybe your headache will go away Try some positivity for a change .
theodore_douglas Damn

merle_dixon It's just that your kind and my kind ain't meant to mix .
merle_dixon That's all .
merle_dixon It doesn't mean we can't .
merle_dixon Work together , parley , as long as there's some kind of mutual gain involved .
merle_dixon So .
merle_dixon about that hacksaw .
theodore_douglas I guess you want me to get that rifle over there too
theodore_douglas so you can shoot that cop when he comes back up , huh ?
merle_dixon Huh

morales A sewer tunnel .

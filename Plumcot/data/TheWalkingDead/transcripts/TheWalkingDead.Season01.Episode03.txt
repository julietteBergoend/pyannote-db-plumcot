carl_grimes I've caught a frog before
shane_walsh I said frogs. plural. and it is an art, my friend. it is not to be taken lightly. there are ways and means. few people know about it. i'm willing to share my secrets 
lori_grimes Oh, i'm a girl. you talk to him
shane_walsh It's a one-time offer, bud. not to be repeated
carl_grimes Why do we need frogs, plural?
shane_walsh You ever eat frog legs?
carl_grimes Eww!
shane_walsh No, yum!
lori_grimes No, he's right. eww
shane_walsh When you get down to that last can of beans, you're gonna be loving those frog legs, lady. i can see it now. "shane, do you think i could have a second helping, please? please? just one?"
lori_grimes Yeah, i doubt that 
shane_walsh Don't listen to her, man. you and me, we'll be heroes. we'll feed these folks cajun-style kermit legs
lori_grimes I would rather eat miss piggy. yes, that came out wrong 
shane_walsh Heroes, son, spoken of in song and legend. you and me, shane and carl

shane_walsh Are you crazy, driving this wailing b*st*rd up here? are you trying to draw every walker for miles?
dale_horvath I think we're okay?
shane_walsh You call being stupid okay?
dale_horvath Well, the alarm was echoing all over these hills. hard to pinpoint the source. i'm not arguing. i'm just saying. it wouldn't hurt you to think things through a little more carefully next time, would it?
glenn_rhee Sorry. got a cool car 
morales Come meet everybody 
andrea_harrison Amy
amy_harrison Andrea! 
andrea_harrison Oh!
amy_harrison Oh my god! you scared the sh1t out of me

morales Hey. come here, sweetie. hey. i told you i'd be back, didn't i? 
dale_horvath You are a welcome sight 
dale_horvath I thought we had lost you folks for sure
shane_walsh How'd y'all get out of there anyway?
glenn_rhee New guy--he got us out
shane_walsh New guy?
morales Yeah, crazy vato just got into town. hey, helicopter boy! come say hello 
morales The guy's a cop like you 
rick_grimes Oh my god 
carl_grimes Dad! dad! 
rick_grimes Carl. oh!  
rick_grimes Disoriented. i guess that comes closest. disoriented. fear, confusion. all those things but. disoriented comes closest
dale_horvath Words can be meager things. sometimes they fall short
rick_grimes I felt like i'd been ripped out of my life and put somewhere else. for a while i thought i was trapped in some coma dream, something i might not wake up from ever.
carl_grimes Mom said you died
rick_grimes She had every reason to believe that. don't you ever doubt it
lori_grimes When things started to get really bad, they told me at the hospital that they were gonna medevac you and the other patients to atlanta, and it never happened
rick_grimes Well, i'm not surprised after atlanta fell
lori_grimes Yeah
rick_grimes And from the look of that hospital, it got overrun
shane_walsh Yeah, looks don't deceive. i barely got them out, you know?
rick_grimes I can't tell you how grateful i am to you, shane. i can't begin to express it
dale_horvath There go those words falling short again. paltry things 
shane_walsh Hey, ed, you want to rethink that log?
ed It's cold, man
shane_walsh The cold don't change the rules, does it? keep our fires low, just embers so we can't be seen from a distance, right?
ed I said it's cold. you should mind your own business for once 
shane_walsh Hey, ed. are you sure you want to have this conversation, man?
ed Go on. pull the damn thing out. go on! 
shane_walsh Christ 
shane_walsh Hey, carol, sophia, how are y'all this evening?
carol_peletier Fine. we're just fine
shane_walsh Okay
carol_peletier I'm sorry about the fire
shane_walsh No no no. no apology needed. y'all have a good night, okay?
carol_peletier Thank you
shane_walsh I appreciate the cooperation 
dale_horvath Have you given any thought to daryl dixon? he won't be happy to hear his brother was left behind
theodore_douglas I'll tell him. i dropped the key. it's on me
rick_grimes I cuffed him. that makes it mine
glenn_rhee Guys, it's not a competition. i don't mean to bring race into this, but it might sound better coming from a white guy
theodore_douglas I did what i did. hell if i'm gonna hide from him
amy_harrison We could lie
andrea_harrison Or tell the truth. merle was out of control. something had to be done or he'd have gotten us killed. your husband did what was necessary. and if merle got left behind, it is nobody's fault but merle's
dale_horvath And that's what we tell daryl? i don't see a rational discussion to be had from that, do you? word to the wise. we're gonna have our hands full when he gets back from his hunt
theodore_douglas I was scared and i ran. i'm not ashamed of it
andrea_harrison We were all scared. we all ran. what's your point?
theodore_douglas I stopped long enough to chain that door. staircase is narrow. maybe half a dozen geeks can squeeze against it at any one time. it's not enough to break through that. not that chain, not that padlock. my point. dixon's alive and he's still up there, handcuffed on that roof. that's on us
rick_grimes I found you, didn't i?
carl_grimes I love you, dad
rick_grimes I love you, carl 
rick_grimes I found you both
lori_grimes Yeah
rick_grimes I knew i would
lori_grimes You're getting cocky now, a little bit
rick_grimes No. no, i knew. walking into our home, finding an empty house, both of you gone
lori_grimes I'm so sorry
rick_grimes I knew you were alive
lori_grimes How?
rick_grimes The photos were gone, all our family albums 
rick_grimes I told you so
lori_grimes Now you're getting cocky, huh? a lot 
rick_grimes It belongs in here
lori_grimes Baby, i really thought i would never see you again. i'm so sorry. for everything. i feel like. when you were in the hospital, i just. i wanted to take it all back. the anger and the bad times. but the mistakes. 
rick_grimes Maybe we got a second chance. not many people get that 
rick_grimes I wondered where that went
lori_grimes Do you want it back?
rick_grimes Of course 
lori_grimes He won't wake up    
rick_grimes Morning
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode03 Morning

woman#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode03 Hi
carol_peletier Morning
rick_grimes Morning
carol_peletier They're still a little damp. the sun'll have 'em dry in no time
rick_grimes You washed my clothes?
carol_peletier Well, best we could. scrubbing on a washboard ain't half as good as my old maytag back home
rick_grimes That's very kind. thank you 
glenn_rhee Look at 'em. vultures. yeah, go on, strip it clean
dale_horvath Generators need every drop of fuel they can get. got no power without it. sorry, glenn
glenn_rhee Thought i'd get to drive it at least a few more days
rick_grimes Maybe we'll get to steal another one someday 
lori_grimes Morning, officer
rick_grimes Hey
lori_grimes You sleep okay?
rick_grimes Better than in a long time
lori_grimes Well, i didn't want to wake you. i figured you could use it. god. what?
rick_grimes I've been thinking about the man we left behind
lori_grimes You're not serious 
shane_walsh Water's here, y'all. just a reminder to boil before use
lori_grimes Are you asking me or telling me?
rick_grimes Asking
lori_grimes Well, i think it's crazy. i think it is just the stupidest way to break your son. 
carl_grimes Mom!
lori_grimes Carl? 
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode03 It's over there!
carl_grimes Dad!
lori_grimes Baby!
sophia Mama! mommy!
glenn_rhee Rick! 
lori_grimes Carl!
man#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode03 Over here, boy! come on, come on!
lori_grimes Carl! baby!
carl_grimes Mom!
rick_grimes You're okay?
lori_grimes I've got him. i've got him. nothing bit you? nothing scratched you?
carl_grimes No, i'm okay 
dale_horvath It's the first one we've had up here. they never come this far up the mountain
jim Well, they're running out of food in the city, that's what 
dale_horvath Oh, jesus
daryl_dixon Son of a bitch. that's my deer! look at it. all gnawed on by this. filthy, disease-bearing, motherless poxy b*st*rd! 
dale_horvath Calm down, son. that's not helping
daryl_dixon What do you know about it, old man? why don't you take that stupid hat and go back to "on golden pond"? i've been tracking this deer for miles. gonna drag it back to camp, cook us up some venison. what do you think? do you think we can cut around this chewed up part right here?
shane_walsh I would not risk that 
daryl_dixon That's a damn shame. i got some squirrel. about a dozen or so. that'll have to do 
amy_harrison Oh god
daryl_dixon Come on, people. what the hell? 
daryl_dixon It's gotta be the brain. don't y'all know nothing? 
daryl_dixon Merle! merle! get your ugly ass out here! i got us some squirrel! let's stew 'em up
shane_walsh Daryl, just slow up a bit. i need to talk to you
daryl_dixon About what?
shane_walsh About merle. there was a. there was a problem in atlanta
daryl_dixon He dead?
shane_walsh We're not sure
daryl_dixon He either is or he ain't!
rick_grimes No easy way to say this, so i'll just say it
daryl_dixon Who are you?
rick_grimes Rick grimes
daryl_dixon Rick grimes, you got something you want to tell me?
rick_grimes Your brother was a danger to us all, so i handcuffed him on a roof, hooked him to a piece of metal. he's still there
daryl_dixon Hold on. let me process this. you're saying you handcuffed my brother to a roof and you left him there?!
rick_grimes Yeah 
theodore_douglas Hey. watch the knife! 
shane_walsh Okay. okay
daryl_dixon You'd best let me go!
shane_walsh Nah, i think it's better if i don't
daryl_dixon Choke hold's illegal
shane_walsh You can file a complaint. come on, man. we'll keep this up all day
rick_grimes I'd like to have a calm discussion on this topic. do you think we can manage that? do you think we can manage that?
shane_walsh Hmm?
daryl_dixon Mmm. yeah 
rick_grimes What i did was not on a whim. your brother does not work and play well with others
theodore_douglas It's not rick's fault. i had the key. i dropped it
daryl_dixon You couldn't pick it up?
theodore_douglas Well, i dropped it in a drain
daryl_dixon If it's supposed to make me feel better, it don't
theodore_douglas Well, maybe this will. look, i chained the door to the roof. so the geeks couldn't get at him. with a padlock
rick_grimes It's gotta count for something
daryl_dixon Hell with all y'all! just tell me where he is so that i can go get him
lori_grimes He'll show you. isn't that right?
rick_grimes I'm going back  
shane_walsh So that's it, huh? you're just gonna walk off? just to hell with everybody else?
rick_grimes I'm not saying to hell with anybody. not you shane. lori least of all
shane_walsh Tell her that
rick_grimes She knows
shane_walsh Well, look, i. i don't, okay, rick? so could you just. could you throw me a bone here, man? could you just tell me why? why would you risk your life for a douche bag like merle dixon?
daryl_dixon Hey, choose your words more carefully
shane_walsh No, i did. douche bag's what i meant. merle dixon. the guy wouldn't give you a glass of water if you were dying of thirst
rick_grimes What he would or wouldn't do doesn't interest me. i can't let a man die of thirst. me. thirst and exposure. we left him like an animal caught in a trap. that's no way for anything to die, let alone a human being
lori_grimes So you and daryl, that's your big plan?
glenn_rhee Oh, come on
rick_grimes You know the way. you've been there before. in and out, no problem. you said so yourself. it's not fair of me to ask. i know that, but i'd feel a lot better with you along. i know she would too
shane_walsh That's just great. now you're gonna risk three men, huh?
theodore_douglas Four 
daryl_dixon My day just gets better and better, don't it?
theodore_douglas You see anybody else here stepping up to save your brother's cracker ass?
daryl_dixon Why you?
theodore_douglas You wouldn't even begin to understand. you don't speak my language
dale_horvath That's four
shane_walsh It's not just four. you're putting every single one of us at risk. just know that, rick. come on, you saw that walker. it was here. it was in camp. they're moving out of the cities. they come back, we need every able body we've got. we need 'em here. we need 'em to protect camp
rick_grimes It seems to me what you really need most here are more guns
glenn_rhee Right, the guns
shane_walsh Wait. what guns?
rick_grimes Six shotguns, two high-powered rifles, over a dozen handguns. i cleaned out the cage back at the station before i left. i dropped the bag in atlanta when i got swarmed. it's just sitting there on the street, waiting to be picked up
shane_walsh Ammo?
rick_grimes 700 rounds, assorted
lori_grimes You went through hell to find us. you just got here and you're gonna turn around and leave?
carl_grimes Dad, i don't want you to go
lori_grimes To hell with the guns. shane is right. merle dixon? he's not worth one of your lives, even with guns thrown in. tell me. make me understand
rick_grimes I owe a debt to a man i met and his little boy. lori, if they hadn't taken me in, i'd have died. it's because of them that i made it back to you at all. they said they'd follow me to atlanta. they'll walk into the same trap i did if i don't warn him
lori_grimes What's stopping you?
rick_grimes The walkie-talkie, the one in the bag i dropped. he's got the other one. our plan was to connect when they got closer
shane_walsh These are our walkies?
rick_grimes Yeah
andrea_harrison So use the cb. what's wrong with that?
shane_walsh The cb's fine. it's the walkies that suck to crap. date back to the '70s, don't match any other bandwidth. not even the scanners in our cars
rick_grimes I need that bag 
rick_grimes Okay? 
lori_grimes All right 
rick_grimes Rumor is you have bolt cutters
dale_horvath Maybe
theodore_douglas Yeah, we get to that roof, though, we'll need to cut that chain and the handcuffs
dale_horvath I never like lending tools. the last time i did. and yes, i am talking about you. let's just say your bag of guns wasn't the only bag that was dropped. my tools got left behind with merle
rick_grimes We'll bring your tools back too. think of the bolt cutters as an investment
dale_horvath Sounds like more of a gamble 
dale_horvath What do i get in return?
rick_grimes What do you want?
dale_horvath How about one of those guns you bring back? my pick
rick_grimes Done
jim Dale, let's. sweeten the deal a bit. now that cube van of yours.
rick_grimes What about it?
jim The rv's radiator hose is shot. that's a problem if we need to get somewhere and wanna get very far. and the hose on that van is just about a perfect match. well, enough that i can make it fit
rick_grimes I'll tell you what. we get back, you can strip that van down to the bare meta 
daryl_dixon Come on, let's go!
rick_grimes Thank you 
shane_walsh Hey, rick, got any rounds in the python?
rick_grimes No
shane_walsh Last time we were on the gun range, i'm sure i wound up with a few loose rounds of yours
rick_grimes You and that bag. like the bottom of an old lady's purse
shane_walsh I hate that you're doing this, man. i think that it's foolish and reckless. but if you're gonna go, you're taking bullets
rick_grimes I'm not sure i'd want to fire a shot in the city, not after what happened last time
shane_walsh That's up to you. well. four men, four rounds. what are the odds, huh? well, let's just hope that. let's just hope four is your lucky number, okay?
rick_grimes Thank you
shane_walsh All right  
lori_grimes Hey. you know, i bet they'll be just fine
carl_grimes I'm not worried. are you?
lori_grimes Yeah, a little
carl_grimes Don't be
lori_grimes Why?
carl_grimes Think about it, mom. everything that's happened to him so far. nothing's killed him yet  
daryl_dixon He'd better be okay. it's my only word on the matter
theodore_douglas I told you the geeks can't get at him. the only thing that's gonna get through that door is us 
glenn_rhee We walk from here 
lori_grimes Dale. have you seen carl?
dale_horvath Shane took him down to the quarry. there was some mighty bold talk about catching frogs
carl_grimes I'm not getting anything
shane_walsh Yeah. being all wily, staying submerged. little suckers, they know something's up. that's what's going on. just going to have to do this the old-fashioned way. all right, little man, look. you are the. you are the key in all this, okay? all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go after one of them, all right, scare the rest of them off. they're all gonna scatter. i'm gonna drive 'em your way, okay?
carl_grimes All right
shane_walsh What you need to do is you need to round up every bad boy you see, all right? are you with me?
carl_grimes Yeah. yeah
shane_walsh Hells yeah. give me your mean face. yes sir. are you ready?
carl_grimes Yeah!
shane_walsh Are you ready? here we go, boy. here we go 
shane_walsh All right, they're coming your way. they're coming your way. go on, get 'em, get 'em. they're coming your way, come on. catch them frogs. catch them frogs. they're coming, little man! get 'em! get that net in there and get 'em! 
jacqui I'm beginning to question the division of labor here 
shane_walsh They're coming, little man! get 'em! get that net in there and get 'em! what have you got, bad boy? what do you got? what do you got?
carl_grimes Dirt
shane_walsh Oh boy. all right, we've got to start over. come on, let's find this bucket
jacqui Can someone explain to me how the women wound up doing all the hattie mcdaniel work?
amy_harrison The world ended. didn't you get the memo? 
carol_peletier It's just the way it is 
rick_grimes Merle first or guns?
daryl_dixon Merle! we ain't even having this conversation
rick_grimes We are. you know the geography. it's your call
glenn_rhee Merle's closest. the guns would mean doubling back. merle first
carol_peletier I do miss my maytag

andrea_harrison Problem, ed?
ed Nothing that concerns you. and you ought to focus on your work. this ain't no comedy club 
lori_grimes Hey, carl, what did i tell you about not leaving dale's sight?
carl_grimes But shane said we could catch frogs, remember?
lori_grimes It doesn't matter what shane says. it matters what i say. go on back to camp. i'll be right behind you 
shane_walsh I've got to tell you, i do not think you should be taking this out on him
lori_grimes You don't tell me what to do. you lost that privilege
shane_walsh Lori, could you just wait up a sec? i think we should talk. we haven't had a chance.
lori_grimes No. no. no. that's over too. you can tell that to the frogs
shane_walsh Damn it, lori. look, i don't know how it appears to you or what you think.
lori_grimes How it appears to me? i'm sorry. is there a gray area here? let me dispel it. you stay away from me. you stay away from my son. you don't look at him. you don't talk to him. from now on, my family is off-limits to you
shane_walsh Lori, i don't think that's fair
lori_grimes Shane, shut up. don't!
shane_walsh I don't think that--
lori_grimes My husband is back. he is alive
shane_walsh He's my best friend. do you think i'm not happy about that?
lori_grimes How dare you? why would you be? you are the one that told me that he died. you son of a bitch

rick_grimes Disoriented .
rick_grimes Fear , confusion .
rick_grimes all those things
rick_grimes but .
rick_grimes Disoriented comes closest
dale_horvath Words can be meager things .
dale_horvath Sometimes they fall short
rick_grimes I felt like I'd been ripped out of my life and put somewhere else .
rick_grimes For a while I thought I was trapped in some coma dream , something I might not wake up from ever .
carl_grimes Mom said you died
rick_grimes She had every reason to believe that .
rick_grimes Don't you ever doubt it
lori_grimes When things started to get really bad , they told me at the hospital that they were gonna medevac you and the other patients to Atlanta , and it never happened
rick_grimes Well , I'm not surprised after Atlanta fell
lori_grimes Yeah
rick_grimes And from the look of that hospital , it got overrun
shane_walsh Yeah , looks don't deceive .
shane_walsh I barely got them out , you know ?
rick_grimes I can't tell you how grateful I am to you , Shane .
rick_grimes I can't begin to express it
dale_horvath There go those words falling short again .
dale_horvath Paltry things
shane_walsh Hey , Ed , you want to rethink that log ?
ed It's cold , man
shane_walsh The cold don't change the rules , does it ?
shane_walsh Keep our fires low , just embers so we can't be seen from a distance , right ?
ed I said it's cold .
ed You should mind your own business for once
shane_walsh Hey , Ed .
shane_walsh Are you sure you want to have this conversation , man ?
ed Go on .
ed Pull the damn thing out .

carol_peletier Thank you
shane_walsh I appreciate the cooperation
dale_horvath Have you given any thought to daryl Dixon ?
dale_horvath He won't be happy to hear
dale_horvath his brother was left behind
theodore_douglas I'll tell him .
theodore_douglas I dropped the key .
theodore_douglas It's on me
rick_grimes I cuffed him .
rick_grimes That makes it mine
glenn_rhee Guys , it's not a competition .
glenn_rhee I don't mean to bring race into this , but it might sound better coming from a white guy
theodore_douglas I did what I did .
theodore_douglas Hell if I'm gonna hide from him
amy_harrison We could lie
andrea_harrison Or tell the truth .
andrea_harrison merle was out of control .
andrea_harrison Something had to be done or he'd have gotten us killed .
andrea_harrison Your husband did what was necessary .
andrea_harrison And if merle got left behind , it is nobody's fault but Merle's
dale_horvath And that's what we tell Daryl ?
dale_horvath I don't see a rational discussion to be had from that , do you ?
dale_horvath Word to the wise .
dale_horvath We're gonna have our hands full when he gets back from his hunt
theodore_douglas I was scared
theodore_douglas and I ran .
theodore_douglas I'm not ashamed of it
andrea_harrison We were all scared .
andrea_harrison We all ran .
andrea_harrison What's your point ?
theodore_douglas I stopped long enough to chain that door .
theodore_douglas Staircase is narrow .
theodore_douglas Maybe half a dozen geeks can squeeze against it at any one time .
theodore_douglas It's not enough to break through that .
theodore_douglas Not that chain , not that padlock .
theodore_douglas My point .
theodore_douglas Dixon's alive
theodore_douglas and he's still up there , handcuffed on that roof .
theodore_douglas That's on us
rick_grimes I found you , didn't I ?
carl_grimes I love you , dad
rick_grimes I love you , carl
rick_grimes I found you both

lori_grimes I'm so sorry .
lori_grimes For everything .
lori_grimes I feel like .
lori_grimes When you were in the hospital , I just .
lori_grimes I wanted to take it all back .
lori_grimes The anger and the bad times .
lori_grimes But the mistakes .
rick_grimes Maybe we got a second chance .
rick_grimes Not many people get that I wondered where that went
lori_grimes Do you want it back ?

shane_walsh There was a problem in Atlanta
daryl_dixon He dead ?
shane_walsh We're not sure
daryl_dixon He either is or he ain't !
rick_grimes No easy way to say this
rick_grimes , so I'll just say it
daryl_dixon Who are you ?
rick_grimes rick Grimes
daryl_dixon rick grimes , you got something you want to tell me ?
rick_grimes Your brother was a danger to us all , so I handcuffed him on a roof , hooked him to a piece of metal .
rick_grimes He's still there
daryl_dixon Hold on .
daryl_dixon Let me process this .
daryl_dixon You're saying you handcuffed my brother to a roof and you left him there? !
rick_grimes Yeah
theodore_douglas Hey .
theodore_douglas Watch the knife !
shane_walsh Okay .
shane_walsh Okay

shane_walsh Come on , man .
shane_walsh We'll keep this up all day
rick_grimes I'd like to have a calm discussion on this topic .
rick_grimes Do you think we can manage that ?
rick_grimes Do you think we can manage that ?
shane_walsh Hmm ?
daryl_dixon Mmm .
daryl_dixon Yeah
rick_grimes What I did was not on a whim .
rick_grimes Your brother does not work and play well with others
theodore_douglas It's not Rick's fault .
theodore_douglas I had the key .
theodore_douglas I dropped it
daryl_dixon You couldn't pick it up ?
theodore_douglas Well , I dropped it in a drain
daryl_dixon If it's supposed to make me feel better , it don't
theodore_douglas Well , maybe this will .
theodore_douglas Look , I chained the door to the roof .
theodore_douglas So the geeks couldn't get at him .
theodore_douglas With a padlock
rick_grimes It's gotta count for something
daryl_dixon Hell with all y'all !
daryl_dixon Just tell me where he is so that I can go get him
lori_grimes He'll show you .
lori_grimes Isn't that right ?
rick_grimes I'm going back
shane_walsh So that's it , huh ?
shane_walsh You're just gonna walk off ?
shane_walsh Just to hell with everybody else ?
rick_grimes I'm not saying to hell with anybody .
rick_grimes Not you Shane .
rick_grimes lori least of all
shane_walsh Tell her that
rick_grimes She knows
shane_walsh Well , look , I. I don't , okay , Rick ?
shane_walsh So could you just .
shane_walsh Could you throw me a bone here , man ?
shane_walsh Could you just tell me why ?
shane_walsh Why would you risk your life for a douche bag like merle Dixon ?
daryl_dixon Hey , choose your words more carefully
shane_walsh No , I did .
shane_walsh Douche bag's what I meant .
shane_walsh merle Dixon .
shane_walsh The guy wouldn't give you a glass of water if you were dying of thirst
rick_grimes What he would or wouldn't do
rick_grimes doesn't interest me .
rick_grimes I can't let a man die of thirst .
rick_grimes me .
rick_grimes Thirst and exposure .
rick_grimes We left him like an animal caught in a trap .
rick_grimes That's no way for anything to die , let alone a human being
lori_grimes So you and Daryl , that's your big plan ?
glenn_rhee Oh , come on
rick_grimes You know the way .
rick_grimes You've been there before .
rick_grimes In and out , no problem .
rick_grimes You said so yourself .
rick_grimes It's not fair of me to ask .
rick_grimes I know that ,
rick_grimes but I'd feel a lot better with you along .
rick_grimes I know she would too
shane_walsh That's just great .
shane_walsh Now you're gonna risk three men , huh ?
theodore_douglas Four
daryl_dixon My day just gets better and better , don't it ?
theodore_douglas You see anybody else here stepping up to save your brother's cracker ass ?
daryl_dixon Why you ?
theodore_douglas You wouldn't even begin to understand .
theodore_douglas You don't speak my language
dale_horvath That's four
shane_walsh It's not just four .
shane_walsh You're putting every single one of us at risk .
shane_walsh Just know that , Rick .
shane_walsh Come on , you saw that Walker .
shane_walsh It was here .
shane_walsh It was in camp .
shane_walsh They're moving out of the cities .
shane_walsh They come back , we need every able body we've got .
shane_walsh We need 'em here .
shane_walsh We need 'em to protect camp
rick_grimes It seems to me what you really need most here are more guns
glenn_rhee Right , the guns
shane_walsh Wait .
shane_walsh What guns ?
rick_grimes Six shotguns , two high-powered rifles , over a dozen handguns .
rick_grimes I cleaned out the cage back at the station before I left .
rick_grimes I dropped the bag in Atlanta when I got swarmed .
rick_grimes It's just sitting there on the street , waiting to be picked up
shane_walsh Ammo ?
rick_grimes 700 rounds , assorted
lori_grimes You went through hell to find us .
lori_grimes You just got here
lori_grimes and you're gonna turn around and leave ?
carl_grimes Dad , I don't want you to go
lori_grimes To hell with the guns .
lori_grimes shane is right .
lori_grimes merle Dixon ?
lori_grimes He's not worth one of your lives , even with guns thrown in .
lori_grimes Tell me .
lori_grimes Make me understand
rick_grimes I owe a debt to a man I met and his little boy .
rick_grimes Lori , if they hadn't taken me in , I'd have died .
rick_grimes It's because of them that I made it back to you at all .
rick_grimes They said they'd follow me to Atlanta .
rick_grimes They'll walk into the same trap I did if I don't warn him
lori_grimes What's stopping you ?
rick_grimes The walkie-talkie , the one in the bag I dropped .
rick_grimes He's got the other one .
rick_grimes Our plan was to connect when they got closer
shane_walsh These are our walkies ?
rick_grimes Yeah
andrea_harrison So use the CB .
andrea_harrison What's wrong with that ?
shane_walsh The CB's fine .
shane_walsh It's the walkies that suck to crap .
shane_walsh Date back to the '70s , don't match any other bandwidth .
shane_walsh Not even the scanners in our cars
rick_grimes I need that bag
rick_grimes Okay ?
lori_grimes All right
rick_grimes Rumor is you have bolt cutters
dale_horvath Maybe
theodore_douglas Yeah , we get to that roof , though , we'll need to cut that chain and the handcuffs
dale_horvath I never like lending tools .
dale_horvath The last time I did .
dale_horvath And yes , I am talking about you .
dale_horvath Let's just say your bag of guns wasn't the only bag that was dropped .
dale_horvath My tools got left behind with merle
rick_grimes We'll bring your tools back too .
rick_grimes Think of the bolt cutters as an investment
dale_horvath Sounds like more of a gamble
dale_horvath What do I get in return ?
rick_grimes What do you want ?
dale_horvath How about one of those guns you bring back ?
dale_horvath My pick
rick_grimes Done
jim Dale , let's .
jim Sweeten the deal a bit .
jim Now that cube van of yours .
rick_grimes What about it ?
jim The RV's radiator hose is shot .
jim That's a problem if we need to get somewhere and wanna get very far .
jim And the hose on that van is just about a perfect match .
jim Well , enough that I can make it fit
rick_grimes I'll tell you what .
rick_grimes we get back , you can strip that van down to the bare meta
daryl_dixon Come on , let's go !
rick_grimes Thank you
shane_walsh Hey , Rick , got any rounds in the python ?
rick_grimes No
shane_walsh Last time we were on the gun range , I'm sure I wound up with a few loose rounds of yours
rick_grimes You and that bag .
rick_grimes like the bottom of an old lady's purse
shane_walsh I hate that you're doing this , man .
shane_walsh I think that it's foolish and reckless .
shane_walsh But if you're gonna go , you're taking bullets
rick_grimes I'm not sure I'd want to fire a shot in the city , not after what happened last time
shane_walsh That's up to you .
shane_walsh Well .
shane_walsh Four men , four rounds .
shane_walsh What are the odds , huh ?
shane_walsh Well , let's just hope that .
shane_walsh Let's just hope four is your lucky number , okay ?
rick_grimes Thank you
shane_walsh All right
lori_grimes Hey .
lori_grimes You know , I bet they'll be just fine
carl_grimes I'm not worried .
carl_grimes Are you ?
lori_grimes Yeah , a little

rick_grimes stares at a sunrise over Atlanta as he tries to reach Morgan on the walkie-talkie .
rick_grimes Morgan , I don't know if you're out there .
rick_grimes I don't know if you can hear me .
rick_grimes Maybe you're listening right now .
rick_grimes I hope so .
rick_grimes I found others .
rick_grimes my family , if you can believe it .
rick_grimes My wife and son , they're alive .
rick_grimes I wanted you to know that .
rick_grimes There's something else you need to know .
rick_grimes Atlanta isn't what we thought .
rick_grimes It's not what they promised .
rick_grimes The city is .
rick_grimes Do not enter the city .
rick_grimes It belongs to the dead now .
rick_grimes We're camped a few miles northwest , up by a big abandoned rock quarry .
rick_grimes You can see it on a map .
rick_grimes I hope you come find us .
rick_grimes But be careful .
rick_grimes Last night walkers came out of the woods .
rick_grimes We lost people .
rick_grimes Watch yourself , Morgan .
rick_grimes Take care of your boy .
rick_grimes I'll try you again tomorrow at dawn
lori_grimes Andrea .
lori_grimes I'm so sorry .
lori_grimes She's gone .
lori_grimes You got to let us take her .
lori_grimes We all cared about her
lori_grimes and I promise we'll be as gentle as we can
rick_grimes She still won't move ?
lori_grimes She won't even talk to us .
lori_grimes She's been there all night .
lori_grimes What do we do ?
shane_walsh Can't just leave Amy like that .
shane_walsh We need to deal with it same as the others
rick_grimes I'll tell her how it is andrea
andrea_harrison I know how the safety works
rick_grimes All right .
rick_grimes Okay .
rick_grimes I'm sorry .
rick_grimes I'm sorry .
rick_grimes I'm sorry
daryl_dixon Y'all can't be serious .
daryl_dixon Let that girl hamstring us ?
daryl_dixon The dead girl's a time bomb
rick_grimes What do you suggest ?
daryl_dixon Take the shot .
daryl_dixon Clean , in the brain from here .
daryl_dixon Hell , I can hit a turkey between the eyes from this distance
lori_grimes No .
lori_grimes For god's sakes , let her be
daryl_dixon Wake up , Jimbo .
daryl_dixon We've got some work to do
morales Thanks .
morales Thanks
glenn_rhee What are you guys doing ?
glenn_rhee This is for geeks .
glenn_rhee Our people go over there
daryl_dixon What's the difference ?
daryl_dixon They're all infected
glenn_rhee Our people go in that row over there .
glenn_rhee We don't burn them !
glenn_rhee We bury them .
glenn_rhee Understand ?
glenn_rhee Our people go in that row over there
daryl_dixon You reap what you sow
morales You know
morales what ?
morales Shut up , man
daryl_dixon Y'all left my brother for dead .
daryl_dixon You had this coming
jacqui Are you bleeding ?

jacqui That blood is fresh .
jacqui Were you bit ?
jim No .

jacqui You got bit
jim I'm fine
jacqui Then show me
jim Don't tell , please
jacqui A walker got him .
jacqui A walker bit
jacqui jim
jim I'm okay .

daryl_dixon Show it to us .
daryl_dixon Show it to us
shane_walsh Easy , jim
shane_walsh Jim , put it down .
shane_walsh Put it down
jim I'm okay .
jim I'm okay .
jim I'm okay .
jim I'm okay
jim I'm okay .
jim I'm okay .
jim I'm okay .
jim I'm okay .
jim I'm okay .
jim I'm okay
daryl_dixon I say we put a pickaxe in his head and the dead girl's and be done with it
shane_walsh Is that what you'd want if it were you ?
daryl_dixon Yeah ,
daryl_dixon and I'd thank you while you did it
dale_horvath I hate to say it .
dale_horvath I never thought I would .
dale_horvath but maybe Daryl's right
rick_grimes Jim's not a monster , Dale , or some rabid dog
dale_horvath I'm not suggesting--
rick_grimes He's sick .
rick_grimes A sick man .
rick_grimes We start down that road , where do we draw the line ?
daryl_dixon The line's pretty clear .
daryl_dixon Zero tolerance for walkers , or them to be
rick_grimes What if we can get him help ?
rick_grimes I heard the C. D. C. was working on a cure
shane_walsh I heard that too .
shane_walsh Heard a lot of things before the world went to hell
rick_grimes What if the CDC is still up and running ?
shane_walsh Man , that is a stretch right there
rick_grimes Why ?
rick_grimes If there's any government left , any structure at all , they'd protect the C. D. C. at all costs , wouldn't they ?
rick_grimes I think it's our best shot .
rick_grimes Shelter , protection .
shane_walsh Okay , Rick , you want those things , all right ?
shane_walsh I do too
shane_walsh , okay ?
shane_walsh Now if they exist , they're at the army base .
shane_walsh Fort Benning
lori_grimes That's 100 miles in the opposite direction
shane_walsh That is right .
shane_walsh But it's away from the hot zone .
shane_walsh Now listen to me .
shane_walsh If that place is operational , it'll be heavily armed .
shane_walsh We'd be safe there
rick_grimes The military were on the front lines of this thing .
rick_grimes They got overrun .
rick_grimes We've all seen that .
rick_grimes The C. D. C. is our best choice and Jim's only chance
daryl_dixon You go looking for aspirin , do what you need to do .
daryl_dixon Someone needs to have some balls to take care of this damn problem !
shane_walsh Hey hey hey !
rick_grimes We don't kill the living
daryl_dixon That's funny coming from a man who just put a gun to my head
shane_walsh We may disagree on some things , not on this .
shane_walsh You put it down .
shane_walsh Go on
rick_grimes Come with me
jim Where are you taking me ?
rick_grimes Somewhere safe
dale_horvath I came to pay my respects .
dale_horvath Did I ever mention how I lost my wife ?
andrea_harrison Cancer , wasn't it ?
dale_horvath Yeah .
dale_horvath I dragged her to every doctor , every test .
dale_horvath And after all the surgeries and the chemos , she was ready .
dale_horvath She accepted it , you know ?
dale_horvath But I never could .
dale_horvath And I spent the last few years so angry .
dale_horvath I felt so cheated .
dale_horvath Since she passed , you girls were the first people .
dale_horvath That I cared anything for .
dale_horvath This is her birthday ?
andrea_harrison Her birthday was always like .
andrea_harrison like a week long affair .
andrea_harrison But I somehow always missed it .
andrea_harrison I was away at college or too busy for kid's parties .
andrea_harrison She'd call all excited .
andrea_harrison I always said that I'd make it home
andrea_harrison and I really always meant to , but I never made it past that phone call
dale_horvath I know things are hard enough for you without adding guilt into the mix , huh ?
carol_peletier I'll do it .
carol_peletier He's my husband
andrea_harrison Amy .
andrea_harrison Amy , I'm sorry
andrea_harrison I'm sorry for not ever being there .
andrea_harrison I always thought there'd be more time .
andrea_harrison I'm here now , Amy .
andrea_harrison I'm here .
andrea_harrison I love you
rick_grimes Say it
shane_walsh Okay .
shane_walsh I'm thinking if you'd of stayed here , if you'd have looked after your own .
shane_walsh Instead you went off .
shane_walsh You took half our manpower with you .
shane_walsh I'm thinking maybe our losses wouldn't have been so bad
rick_grimes If we hadn't gone off and brought those guns back when we did , I think our losses would have been a lot worse .
rick_grimes Maybe the entire camp
daryl_dixon I still think it's a mistake not burning these bodies .
daryl_dixon It's what we said we'd do , right ?
daryl_dixon Burn 'em all , wasn't that the idea ?
shane_walsh At first
daryl_dixon The Chinaman gets all emotional , says it's not the thing to do , we just follow him along ?
daryl_dixon These people need to know who the hell's in charge here , what the rules are
rick_grimes There are no rules
lori_grimes Well , that's a problem .
lori_grimes We haven't had one minute to hold onto anything of our old selves .
lori_grimes We need time to mourn and we need to bury our dead .
lori_grimes It's what people do
jim Oh no .
jim No no
jim no no .
jim No , not this , please .
jim No no no .
jim Oh , no no no .
jim No no
andrea_harrison I can do it .
andrea_harrison I can do it .
andrea_harrison I can do it !
andrea_harrison I can do it
dale_horvath Hey
rick_grimes Burying other people is bad enough , but the thought of one of us .
lori_grimes Shh
carl_grimes Are we safe now , dad ?
carl_grimes Now that we're together ?
rick_grimes I won't leave again .
rick_grimes I promise you that .
rick_grimes Not for anything .
rick_grimes Now give me a chance to discuss some things with your mom , okay ?
carl_grimes Yeah
rick_grimes All right .
rick_grimes All right shane blames me for not being here .
rick_grimes Do you ?
rick_grimes We got guns now .
rick_grimes We're stronger
lori_grimes And we have fewer people .
lori_grimes That makes us weaker .
lori_grimes You want me to say I think you were right ?
lori_grimes I understand that .
lori_grimes All I can say is that neither one of you is entirely wrong .
lori_grimes It's the best I can do right now
rick_grimes What about the CDC ?
lori_grimes Rick--
rick_grimes We're at the ragged edge here .
rick_grimes We need relief and we got a sick man who needs help .
rick_grimes I don't know why people can't see that
lori_grimes Well , look at their faces .
lori_grimes Look at mine .
lori_grimes We're all terrified .
lori_grimes If one of us suggested , based on a hunch , that we head toward that city , you'd have no part of it .
lori_grimes Tell me something with certainty
rick_grimes I love you .
rick_grimes That's all I got
lori_grimes I love you too
carol_peletier His fever is worse
lori_grimes You need anything ?
jim Uh .
jim Water .
jim Could use more water
lori_grimes I'll get some
jim Okay
lori_grimes Carol , you help me ?
jim You save a grave for me ?
rick_grimes Nobody wants that
jim It's not about what you want .
jim That , uh .
jim that sound you hear , that's God laughing while you make plans
rick_grimes What I want , Jim , if .
rick_grimes if God allows , is to get you some help
jim Watch the mangroves .
jim Their roots will gouge the whole boat .
jim You know that , right ?
jim Amy is there swimming .
jim You'll watch the boat , right ?
jim You said you would
rick_grimes I'll watch the boat .
rick_grimes Don't worry
jim Okay
shane_walsh I need you to help talk some sense into Rick .
shane_walsh Look , this C. D. C. thing
shane_walsh , Lori , it's a mistake .
shane_walsh So you're backing him ?
lori_grimes What else would I do ?
lori_grimes He's my husband
shane_walsh Look , it may be time for you to play the dutiful wife , but you can't tell me that fixing your marriage is worth putting people's lives at risk
lori_grimes I think folks around here can make up their minds without bringing my marriage into it .
lori_grimes It's a habit you need to break
shane_walsh I guess I'll just add it to the list of habits that I'm breaking whether I like it or not
rick_grimes What habits ?
shane_walsh Just talking about my need for a plan , man .
shane_walsh So what is it ?
shane_walsh Are we leaving or not ?
shane_walsh Maybe y'all just want to stay here .
shane_walsh We could hang some more tin cans
rick_grimes We can't stay here .
rick_grimes We both know that
lori_grimes I was just telling shane
lori_grimes I think we should trust your gut
shane_walsh Let's go
shane_walsh do our sweep
shane_walsh Tell you what , man , these people , man , they're not convinced .
shane_walsh You know ?
shane_walsh You head to the C. D. C
shane_walsh , you might be on your own .
shane_walsh You gotta really consider whether you want to put lori and carl in that kind of spot
rick_grimes I got to do what's best for my family
shane_walsh Best for your family ?
shane_walsh What's that ?
shane_walsh Exposing them to all kinds of risks ?
rick_grimes As opposed to what ?
rick_grimes Crossing 100 miles of hostile territory ?
rick_grimes If we're looking for a lifeline , I say swim toward the closest ship , not further out to sea .
rick_grimes Why can't you back me up ?
shane_walsh Look , I want to
shane_walsh it's just .
shane_walsh I don't see it
rick_grimes If it was your family , you'd feel differently
shane_walsh What did you say to me ?
shane_walsh I kept 'em safe , man .
shane_walsh I looked after them like they were my own .
shane_walsh That's what I did
rick_grimes I didn't mean it that way
shane_walsh Well , how'd you mean it ?
shane_walsh Go on , man .
shane_walsh How'd you mean it ?
rick_grimes You're misinterpreting me
shane_walsh All right
rick_grimes You're just hearing it wrong
shane_walsh Yeah ?
rick_grimes Look , you know .
rick_grimes You know I can never repay that debt , okay ?
dale_horvath Jesus
shane_walsh I know .
shane_walsh Gonna have to start wearing reflective vests out here .
shane_walsh Seriously .
shane_walsh Come on , man .
shane_walsh Come on , man , let's go .
shane_walsh Nothing out here I've been , uh .
shane_walsh I've been thinking about Rick's plan .
shane_walsh Now look , there are no .
shane_walsh There are no guarantees either way .
shane_walsh I'll be the first one to admit that .
shane_walsh I've known this man a long time .
shane_walsh I trust his instincts .
shane_walsh I say the most important thing here is we need to stay together .
shane_walsh So those of you that agree , we leave first thing in the morning .
shane_walsh Okay ?
rick_grimes We're moving out , leaving the quarry .
rick_grimes If you heard me yesterday , you may be coming here .
rick_grimes If you are , we'll be gone by the time you arrive .
rick_grimes I'm leaving a note and map behind for you taped to a red car so you can follow our trail .
rick_grimes We're heading to the C. D. C.
rick_grimes If there's anything left , it's got to be there , don't you think ?
rick_grimes Morgan .
rick_grimes I hope you were right about that place .

dale_horvath I said I needed the one from the cube van
rick_grimes Can you jury-rig it ?
dale_horvath That's all it's been so far .
dale_horvath It's more duct tape than hose .
dale_horvath And I'm out of duct tape
shane_walsh I see something up ahead .
shane_walsh A gas station if we're lucky
jacqui Y'all , Jim .
jacqui It's bad .
jacqui I don't think he can take anymore

dale_horvath Back in the camp when I said daryl might be right
dale_horvath and you shut me down ,
dale_horvath you misunderstood .
dale_horvath I would never go along with callously killing a man .
dale_horvath I was just gonna suggest that we ask jim what he wants .
dale_horvath And I think we have an answer
shane_walsh We just leave him here ?
shane_walsh We take off ?

shane_walsh and I listened for a heartbeat
shane_walsh and I did not hear one .
shane_walsh And I-I-I-I-I don't know why .

andrea_harrison We didn't come here for the eggs
edwin_jenner Give me playback of TS-19
vi Playback of TS-19
edwin_jenner Few people ever got a chance to see this .
edwin_jenner Very few
carl_grimes Is that a brain ?
edwin_jenner An extraordinary one .
edwin_jenner Not that it matters in the end .
edwin_jenner Take us in for E. I. V.
vi Enhanced internal view
shane_walsh What are those lights ?
edwin_jenner It's a person's life-experiences , memories .
edwin_jenner It's everything .
edwin_jenner Somewhere in all that organic wiring , all those ripples of light , is you-the thing that makes you unique and human
daryl_dixon You don't make sense ever ?
edwin_jenner Those are synapses .
edwin_jenner Electric impulses in the brain that carry all the messages .
edwin_jenner They determine everything a person says does or thinks from the moment of birth to the moment of death
rick_grimes Death ?
rick_grimes That's what this is , a vigil ?
edwin_jenner Yes .
edwin_jenner Or rather the playback of the vigil
andrea_harrison This person died ?
andrea_harrison Who ?
edwin_jenner Test subject 19 .
edwin_jenner Someone who was bitten and infected .
edwin_jenner and volunteered to have us record the process .
edwin_jenner VI , Scan forward to the first event
vi Scanning to first event
glenn_rhee What is that ?
edwin_jenner It invades the brain like meningitis .
edwin_jenner The adrenal glands hemorrhage , the brain goes into shutdown , then the major organs .
edwin_jenner Then death .
edwin_jenner Everything you ever were or ever will be .
edwin_jenner gone
sophia Is that what happened to Jim ?
carol_peletier Yes
lori_grimes She lost somebody two days ago .
lori_grimes Her sister
edwin_jenner I lost somebody too .
edwin_jenner I know how devastating it is .
edwin_jenner Scan to the second event
vi Scanning to second event
edwin_jenner The resurrection times vary wildly .
edwin_jenner We had reports of it happening in as little as three minutes .
edwin_jenner The longest we heard of was eight hours .
edwin_jenner In the case of this patient , it was two hours , one minute .
edwin_jenner seven seconds
lori_grimes It restarts the brain ?
edwin_jenner No , just the brain stem .
edwin_jenner Basically , it gets them up and moving
rick_grimes But they're not alive ?
edwin_jenner You tell me
rick_grimes It's nothing like before .
rick_grimes Most of that brain is dark
edwin_jenner Dark , lifeless , dead .
edwin_jenner The frontal lobe , the neocortex , the human part-that doesn't come back .
edwin_jenner The you part .
edwin_jenner Just a shell driven by mindless instinct
carol_peletier God .
carol_peletier What was that ?
andrea_harrison He shot his patient in the head .
andrea_harrison Didn't you ?
edwin_jenner VI , Power down the main screen and the workstations
vi Powering down main screen and workstations
andrea_harrison You have no idea what it is , do you ?
edwin_jenner It could be microbial , viral , parasitic , fungal
jacqui Or the wrath of god ?
edwin_jenner There is that
andrea_harrison Somebody must know something .
andrea_harrison Somebody somewhere
carol_peletier There are others , right ?
carol_peletier Other facilities ?
edwin_jenner There may be some .
edwin_jenner People like me
rick_grimes But you don't know ?
rick_grimes How can you not know ?
edwin_jenner Everything went down .
edwin_jenner Communications , directives-all of it .
edwin_jenner I've been in the dark for almost a month
andrea_harrison So it's not just here .
andrea_harrison There's nothing left anywhere ?
andrea_harrison Nothing ?
andrea_harrison That's what you're really saying , right ?
jacqui Jesus
daryl_dixon Man , I'm gonna get shitfaced drunk again
dale_horvath Dr .
dale_horvath Jenner , I know this has been taxing for you
dale_horvath and I hate to ask one more question , but .
dale_horvath that clock-it's counting down .
dale_horvath What happens at zero ?
edwin_jenner The basement generators--they run out of fuel
rick_grimes And then ?
rick_grimes Vi , what happens when the power runs out ?
vi When the power runs out , facility-wide decontamination will occur
glenn_rhee Decontamination--what does that mean ?
shane_walsh I don't like the way jenner clammed up .
shane_walsh The way he just wandered off like that
theodore_douglas What's wrong with him ?
theodore_douglas Seriously , man .
theodore_douglas Is he nuts , medicated , what ?
rick_grimes In there Check that way .
rick_grimes shane

edwin_jenner I did the best I could in the time that I had .
edwin_jenner I hope you'd be proud of that
edwin_jenner We always think there's gonna be more time . .
edwin_jenner Then it runs out
carol_peletier Why is the air off ?
lori_grimes And the lights in our room ?
daryl_dixon What's going on ?
daryl_dixon Why is everything turned off ?
edwin_jenner Energy use is being prioritized
dale_horvath Air isn't a priority ?
dale_horvath And lights ?
edwin_jenner It's not up to me .
edwin_jenner Zone 5 is shutting itself down
daryl_dixon Hey !
daryl_dixon Hey , what the hell does that mean ?
daryl_dixon Hey , man , I'm talking to you .
daryl_dixon What do you mean it's shutting itself down ?
daryl_dixon How can a building do anything ?
edwin_jenner You'd be surprised
lori_grimes Rick ?
rick_grimes Jenner , what's happening ?
edwin_jenner The system is dropping all the nonessential uses of power .
edwin_jenner It's designed to keep the computers running to the last possible second .
edwin_jenner That started as we approached the half-hour mark .
edwin_jenner Right on schedule
edwin_jenner It was the french
andrea_harrison What ?
edwin_jenner They were the last ones to hold out as far as I know .
edwin_jenner While our people were bolting out the doors and committing suicide in the hallways , they stayed in the labs till the end .
edwin_jenner They thought they were close to a solution
jacqui What happened ?
edwin_jenner The same thing that's happening here .

rick_grimes Little girl? i'm a policeman. little girl.
rick_grimes Don't be afraid, okay? little girl.
rick_grimes Oh my god.
rick_grimes What's the difference between men and women?
shane_walsh This a joke?
rick_grimes No, i'm serious.
shane_walsh I never met a woman who knew how to turn off a light. they're born thinking in a switch, it only goes one way. on. they're struck blind the second they leave a room. i mean every woman, i ever let have a key. i swear to god. come home, house all lit up, and my job, apparently because. because my chromosomes happen to be different cause i then gotta walk through that house, turn off every single light this chick left on.
rick_grimes Is that right?
shane_walsh Yeah, baby. mmm. oh, reverend shane is preaching to you, now, boy.
shane_walsh The same chick, mind ya. she'll bitch about global warming. that's when reverend shane wants to quote from the guy gospel and say "um, darling? maybe you, and every other pair of boobs on this planet just figured out that the light switch see, goes both ways, "maybe we wouldn't have so much global warming"
rick_grimes You say that?
shane_walsh Yeah. anyway, uh. polite version. still man, that. that earns me this. this look and loathing you would not believe. and that's when the exorcist voice pops out. "you sound just like my damn father. always, always yelling about the power bill, telling me to turn off the damn lights"
rick_grimes And what do you say to that?
shane_walsh You know what i wanna say. i wanna say, "bitch, you mean to tell me you've been hearing this your entire life and you are still too damn stupid to learn how to turn off a switch? you know. i don't actually say that, tho
rick_grimes That would be bad
shane_walsh Right right. yeah, i go with the i go with the polite version there too
rick_grimes Very wise
shane_walsh Yes sir
rick_grimes Mmm-hmm
shane_walsh Well. so how's it with lori, man?
rick_grimes She's good. she's good at turning off lights. really good. i don't know why i sometimes forget
shane_walsh Not what i meant
rick_grimes We didn't have a great night
shane_walsh Hey, look, man, i may have failed to amuse with my sermon, but i did try. the least you can do is is speak
rick_grimes That's what she always
says#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode01 "speak". "speak". you'd think i was the most closed mouth son of a bitch you'd ever hear her telling
shane_walsh Do you express your thoughts? do you share your feelings, that kind of stuff?
rick_grimes The thing is. lately whenever i try. everything i say makes her impatient, like she didn't want to hear it after all. it's like she's. pissed at me all the time, and i don't know why
shane_walsh Look, man. that's just shit couples go through. yeah, it's a phase
rick_grimes The last thing she said this morning?
shane_walsh Mm?
rick_grimes Sometimes i wonder if you even care about us at all. she said that in front of our kid. imagine going to school with that in your head. difference between men and women? i would never say something that cruel to her. certainly not in front of carl before they can elaborate, they get a call about a high speed chase.

morgan_jones No. not the one's they put down. the one's they didn't. the walkers. like the one i shot today. cause he would have ripped into you. try to eat you, take him some flesh at least. but i guess if this is the first you're hearing, i know how it must sound.
rick_grimes They're out there now? in the street?
morgan_jones Yeah. they're even more active after dark sometimes. maybe it's the cool air or. hell, maybe it's just me firing up that gun today. but we'll be fine long as we stay quiet. probably wander off by morning. well, listen. one thing i do know. don't you get bit! we saw your bandage and that's why we were afraid of. bites kill you. the fever. burns you out. but then after a while. you come back

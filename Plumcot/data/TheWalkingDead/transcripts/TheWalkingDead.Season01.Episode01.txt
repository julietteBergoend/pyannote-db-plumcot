shane_walsh This a joke ?
rick_grimes No , I'm serious .
shane_walsh I never met a woman who knew how to turn off a light .
shane_walsh They're born thinking in a switch , it only goes one way .

shane_walsh They're struck blind the second they leave a room .
shane_walsh I mean every woman , I ever let have a key .
shane_walsh I swear to God .
shane_walsh Come home , house all lit up , and my job , apparently because .
shane_walsh because my chromosomes happen to be different cause I then gotta walk through that house , turn off every single light this chick left on .

shane_walsh Mmm .
shane_walsh Oh , reverend shane is preaching to you , now , boy .
shane_walsh The same chick , mind ya .
shane_walsh She'll bitch about global warming .
shane_walsh That's when Reverend shane wants to quote from the Guy Gospel and say " Um , darling ?
shane_walsh maybe you , and every other pair of boobs on this planet just figured out that the light switch see , goes both ways ,
shane_walsh " maybe we wouldn't have so much global warming "
rick_grimes You say that ?
shane_walsh Yeah .
shane_walsh Anyway , uh .
shane_walsh Polite version .
shane_walsh Still man , that .
shane_walsh that earns me this .
shane_walsh This look and loathing you would not believe .
shane_walsh And that's when the exorcist voice pops out .
shane_walsh " You sound just like my damn father .
shane_walsh Always , always yelling about the power bill , telling me to turn off the damn lights "
rick_grimes And what do you say to that ?
shane_walsh You know what I wanna say .
shane_walsh I wanna say , " Bitch , you mean to tell me you've been hearing this your entire life
shane_walsh and you are still too damn stupid to learn how to turn off a switch ?

shane_walsh Not what I meant
rick_grimes We didn't have a great night
shane_walsh Hey , look , man , I may have failed to amuse with my sermon , but I did try .
shane_walsh The least you can do is is speak
rick_grimes That's what she always
rick_grimes " Speak " .
rick_grimes " Speak " .
rick_grimes You'd think I was the most closed mouth son of a bitch
rick_grimes you'd ever hear her telling
shane_walsh Do you express your thoughts ?
shane_walsh Do you share your feelings , that kind of stuff ?
rick_grimes The thing is .
rick_grimes lately whenever I try .
rick_grimes everything I say makes her impatient , like she didn't want to hear it after all .
rick_grimes It's like she's .
rick_grimes pissed at me all the time , and I don't know why
shane_walsh Look , man .
shane_walsh That's just shit couples go through .
shane_walsh Yeah , It's a phase
rick_grimes The last thing she said this morning ?
shane_walsh Mm ?
rick_grimes Sometimes I wonder if you even care about us at all .
rick_grimes She said that in front of our kid .
rick_grimes Imagine going to school with that in your head .
rick_grimes Difference between men and women ?
rick_grimes I would never say something that cruel to her .
rick_grimes Certainly not in front of carl  .

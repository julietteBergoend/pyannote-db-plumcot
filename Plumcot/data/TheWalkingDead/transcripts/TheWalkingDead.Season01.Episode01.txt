rick_grimes Little girl? I'm a policeman. Little girl.
rick_grimes Don't be afraid, okay? Little girl.
rick_grimes Oh my god.
rick_grimes What's the difference between men and women?
shane_walsh This a joke?
rick_grimes No, I'm serious.
shane_walsh I never met a woman who knew how to turn off a light. They're born thinking in a switch, it only goes one way. On. They're struck blind the second they leave a room. I mean every woman, I ever let have a key. I swear to God. Come home, house all lit up, and my job, apparently because. because my chromosomes happen to be different cause I then gotta walk through that house, turn off every single light this chick left on.
rick_grimes Is that right?
shane_walsh Yeah, baby. Mmm. Oh, reverend shane is preaching to you, now, boy.
shane_walsh The same chick, mind ya. She'll bitch about global warming. That's when Reverend shane wants to quote from the Guy Gospel and say "Um, darling? maybe you, and every other pair of boobs on this planet just figured out that the light switch see, goes both ways, "maybe we wouldn't have so much global warming"
rick_grimes You say that?
shane_walsh Yeah. Anyway, uh. Polite version. Still man, that. that earns me this. This look and loathing you would not believe. And that's when the exorcist voice pops out. "You sound just like my damn father. Always, always yelling about the power bill, telling me to turn off the damn lights"
rick_grimes And what do you say to that?
shane_walsh You know what I wanna say. I wanna say, "Bitch, you mean to tell me you've been hearing this your entire life and you are still too damn stupid to learn how to turn off a switch? You know. I don't actually say that, tho
rick_grimes That would be bad
shane_walsh Right right. Yeah, I go with the I go with the polite version there too
rick_grimes Very wise
shane_walsh Yes sir
rick_grimes Mmm-hmm
shane_walsh Well. So how's it with Lori, man?
rick_grimes She's good. She's good at turning off lights. Really good. I don't know why I sometimes forget
shane_walsh Not what I meant
rick_grimes We didn't have a great night
shane_walsh Hey, look, man, I may have failed to amuse with my sermon, but I did try. The least you can do is is speak
rick_grimes That's what she always
says#unknown#TheWalkingDead.Season01.Episode01 "Speak". "Speak". You'd think I was the most closed mouth son of a bitch you'd ever hear her telling
shane_walsh Do you express your thoughts? Do you share your feelings, that kind of stuff?
rick_grimes The thing is. lately whenever I try. everything I say makes her impatient, like she didn't want to hear it after all. It's like she's. pissed at me all the time, and I don't know why
shane_walsh Look, man. That's just shit couples go through. Yeah, It's a phase
rick_grimes The last thing she said this morning?
shane_walsh Mm?
rick_grimes Sometimes I wonder if you even care about us at all. She said that in front of our kid. Imagine going to school with that in your head. Difference between men and women? I would never say something that cruel to her. Certainly not in front of carl Before they can elaborate, they get a call about a high speed chase.

morgan_jones Son, you know they don't talk 
morgan_jones Hey, mister, what's that bandage for?
rick_grimes What?
morgan_jones What kind of wound? You answer me, damn you. What's your wound?
morgan_jones You tell me. or I will kill you
morgan_jones Got that bandaged changed now. It was pretty rank. What was the wound?
rick_grimes Gunshot
morgan_jones Gunshot? What else? Anything?
rick_grimes Gunshot ain't enough?
morgan_jones Look, I ask and you answer. That's common courtesy, right? Did you get bit?
rick_grimes Bit?
morgan_jones Bit, chewed, maybe scratched anything like that?
rick_grimes No, I got shot. Just shot as far as I know
morgan_jones Hey. Just let me 
morgan_jones Feels cool enough. Fever would've killed you by now
rick_grimes I don't think I have one
morgan_jones Be hard to miss
morgan_jones Take a moment, look how sharp it is. You try anything, I will kill you with it. And don't you think I won't
morgan_jones Come on out when you're able. Come on
rick_grimes This place Fred and Cindy Drake's?
morgan_jones Never met them
rick_grimes I've been here. This is their place
morgan_jones It was empty when we got here 
morgan_jones Don't do that. They'll see the light. There's more of them out there than usual. I never should have fired that gun today. The sound draws them, now they're all over the street. Stupid. using a gun. It all happened so fast. I didn't think
rick_grimes You shot that man today
morgan_jones Man?
duane It weren't no man
morgan_jones What the hell was that out of your mouth just now?
duane It wasn't a man
rick_grimes You shot him in the street out front a man
morgan_jones Friend, you need glasses. It was a walker
morgan_jones Come on. Sit down before you fall down.
duane Daddy, blessing
morgan_jones Yeah 
morgan_jones Father, we thank thee for this food. Thy blessings. We ask you to watch over us in these crazy days. Amen
duane Amen
morgan_jones Hey, mister, you even know what's going on?
rick_grimes I woke up today in the hospital, came home and that's all I know
morgan_jones But you know about the dead people, right?
rick_grimes Yeah, I saw a lot of that out on the loading dock, piled in trucks
morgan_jones No. Not the one's they put down. The one's they didn't. The walkers. Like the one I shot today. Cause he would have ripped into you. Try to eat you, take him some flesh at least. But I guess if this is the first you're hearing, I know how it must sound.
rick_grimes They're out there now? In the street?
morgan_jones Yeah. They're even more active after dark sometimes. Maybe it's the cool air or. Hell, maybe it's just me firing up that gun today. But we'll be fine long as we stay quiet. Probably wander off by morning. Well, listen. One thing I do know. Don't you get bit! We saw your bandage and that's why we were afraid of. Bites kill you. The fever. burns you out. But then after a while. You come back
duane Seen it happen
morgan_jones Come on They continue eating quietly. After supper, duane is sleeping next to his father.
morgan_jones Carl he your son? Well, you you said his name today
rick_grimes He's a little younger than your boy
morgan_jones And he's with his mother?
rick_grimes I hope so
duane Dad?
morgan_jones Hey
duane Did you ask him?
morgan_jones Your gun shot. We got a little bet going. My boy says you're a. bank robber.
rick_grimes Yeah. That's me. Deadly as Dillinger. Kapow. Sheriff's deputy
morgan_jones Uh-huh 
morgan_jones Hey, It's okay. Daddy's here. It's nothing. One of them must've bumped a car
rick_grimes Are you sure?
morgan_jones It happened once before. It went on for a few minutes. Get the light, duane 
morgan_jones It's the blue one on the street, the same one as last time. I think we're okay
rick_grimes That noise won't it bring more of them?
morgan_jones Nothing we can do about it now. Just have to wait them out till morning 
duane She's here
morgan_jones Don't look. Get away from the windows. I said go. Go on duane starts to cry and morgan comforts him.
morgan_jones Duane. Duane, quiet now. Come on. Quiet now. Shh shh
morgan_jones It's okay. Here. Cry into the pillow. Do you remember? Shh. Shh
morgan_jones She, uh. She died in the other room, on that bed. Nothing I can do about it here. That fever, man. Her skin gave off heat like a furnace. Should have put her down, I should have put her down, I know that, but. You know what. I just didn't have it in me. She's the mother of my child
rick_grimes Are we sure they're dead?
morgan_jones You have to ask, just one more time. They're dead. Except for something in the brain. That's why it's gotta be the head One of them is lying up against the fence post but gets up and starts walking towards Rick.
morgan_jones You alright?
rick_grimes I need a momentThey enter Rick's house.
rick_grimes They're alive my wife and son. At least they were when they left
morgan_jones How can you know? By the look of this place.
rick_grimes I found empty drawers in the bedroom. They packed some clothes. Not a lot. But enough to travel
morgan_jones You know anybody could've broken in here and stole them clothes, right?
rick_grimes You see the framed photos on the walls? Neither do I. Some random thief took those too, you think? My photo albums, family pictures, all gone
morgan_jones Photo albums. My wife. Same thing. Here I am, packing survival gear, she's grabbing photo albums.
duane They're in Atlanta, I bet
morgan_jones That's right

rick_grimes Atlanta sounds like a good deal. Safer anyway people
morgan_jones That's where we were heading. Things got crazy. Man, you won't believe. The panic. Streets won't fit to be on, and then well. My wife. couldn't travel. No, not with our hurt, so we had to find a place to lay low. And then, after she died. We just stayed hunkered down. I guess we just froze in place
rick_grimes Plan to move on?
morgan_jones Haven't worked up to it yet
rick_grimes A lot of It's gone missing
duane Daddy, can I learn to shoot? I'm old enough
morgan_jones Hell yes you're going to learn. We gotta do it carefully, teach you to respect the weapon

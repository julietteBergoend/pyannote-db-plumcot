Dwight I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
Kevin You're eating eight year old tomatoes?
Dwight They're still good for another week.
Meredith You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. 
Kevin I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. 
Dwight Hardy har har. Okay picture this Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
Jim Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
Dwight No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
Jim Three months.
Dwight Could be.
Jim Four months.
Dwight I can see that happening, yes.
Jim Eight months?
Dwight That's a realistic time line.
Jim  Eleven months.
Dwight Perhaps.
Jim Okay now really think hard about this one One year.
Dwight I can see that as a very real possibility.
Jim  Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Dwight I can see that happening.
Jim Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...
Todd I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.
Michael Still not seeing the problem here.
Todd All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!
Michael It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
Holly  Hi!
Michael Hi. 
Holly You must be Todd.
Todd  Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!
Holly  Very funny. Okay let's get started.
Todd After you!
Michael Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.
Michael Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.
Holly All right.
Michael And it also helps if you've had five shots.
Holly I already have.
Michael Whoa!
Jim  Why is Packer back?
Michael Is Packer here?
Dwight Why's he talking to Holly?
Michael  Don't know, don't care.
Holly  Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
Todd  Oh!
Michael  Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
Kevin Yes!
Jim What!?
Todd It's great to be among friends, but until then, you suckers will do!
Kevin Nice! We got burned!
Michael You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
Dwight  Holly, you approved this?
Holly Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.
Jim You did approve it?
Holly Yeah.
Kevin What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
Kevin I have very little patience for stupidity.
Erin  Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
Gabe I'm such a klutz!
Erin Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
Pam I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! Right?
Erin Thank you Pam.
Pam Awwh, you're welcome. My pleasure.
Jim  Can I do something for ya?
Pam I just helped someone out. It feels good.
Jim Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
Pam So you know the feeling.
Michael Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
Dwight I didn't order anything.
Michael And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
Dwight Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
Michael So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. 
Todd Thanks man, it'd mean a lot.
Dwight I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
Todd well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk.
Dwight No it is not.
Todd Is too!
Michael  Let's look at this.
Todd Check it out!
Dwight I don't wanna move desks!
Michael Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
Jim Do I have any say in this?!
Michael No!
Todd  Don't even watch, Halpert!
Dwight  Hey, who's dirt box is this?
Holly Oh, that's our Zen garden.
Dwight What do you grow in here, bullcrap? 
Pam  Hey, um...
Holly Hey, what's up guys?
Meredith Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
Jim Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
Holly Uhm.
Pam He's seriously awful!
Holly Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!
Meredith That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
Jim  Why are you nodding?
Pam United front...
Holly Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.
Ryan Right this isn't the U.S. Government.
Kelly What are you referencing?
Ryan  Everything... Everything.
Holly Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
Jim Well, I mean he humped Michael.
Holly Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too. 
Andy  Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. This computer's a hunk of jjunk.
Erin Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! 
Andy Where did you get this?!
Erin Pam gave it to me!
Andy This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?
Pam You have a computer Andy.
Andy Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...
Pam Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
Andy Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...
Pam Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
Stanley So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Andy I'm not asking for one, I need it.
Phyllis If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
Andy Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.
Pam See, this is what I'm talking about.
Andy What are you gonna play mange on faster?
Pam Sorry Andy.
Todd Hey what's going on you guys? Yeahh! Three muska-queers!
Kevin  Mean but good!
Holly So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
Todd I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom. 
Holly Well, some girls go through a phase.
Kevin Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
Todd Since when did you learn how to read?
Kevin I do know how to read though!
Todd Yeah. You know how to read... a menu!
Kevin  He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
Dwight Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
Pam  What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!
Andy It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
Pam What? Erin is that true?
Erin  I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
Pam Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.
Andy Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-
Pam I'm not freaking out, Andy.
Andy -take a few breaths, and then I ask myself Is this worth freaking out about?
Pam Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
Andy That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
Pam Switch the computers back Andy.
Andy Seriously?
Pam Seriously.
Andy Pam! Come on!
Pam Now please.
Andy Fine! Please make sure no one is humping me!
Erin  Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. Thanks.
Michael Best day ever. Best day ever!
Holly So much happening. 
Michael Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
Holly No! No.
Michael Please.
Holly Did Todd tell you to do that?
Michael Yeah, You love him right? You love him. I can tell.
Holly I love you.
Michael No. Not me, him.
Holly That's certainly opinionated.
Erin  If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
Holly Oh I'm going.
Michael Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...
Holly I don't think he's funnier than me.
Michael He's funnier than me.
Holly No, he's not funny at all.
Michael So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
Erin  Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
Holly No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
Michael  Uhm...
Holly Ok Bill Cosby , Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here Todd Packer.
Michael That's insane!
Holly Honey, he's a jerk.
Erin  For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! 
Todd  So you two are married to each other now, right?
Jim Yeah.
Todd That's sweet. How's the s*x?
Jim 
Dwight  Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
Todd Why?
Dwight 'Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
Jim That's a lot of reasons! 
Dwight Drink it!
Todd I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox. 
Jim  Can I talk to you a second?
Jim So, this hot chocolate thing.
Dwight None of your business.
Jim Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
Dwight It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
Jim I really think we should join forces on this one.
Dwight Really.
Jim What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
Dwight I know.
Jim Here we go.
Dwight Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
Jim You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
Dwight  Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
Jim Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
Dwight Who is Justice Beaver?
Jim He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
Dwight Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
Jim Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.
Dwight Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
Andy Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
Pam I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.
Andy Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
Pam  You did that?
Andy Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.
Pam Okay. When did people sign-
Andy Mind if I close the door? What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.
Pam Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
Andy You humiliated me in front of every body!
Pam Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.
Andy I mean, it's pretty broken already.
Pam Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
Andy  Pretty sneaky sis. 
Ryan  Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. 
Dwight  There are over four hundred of these! 
Jim Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
Dwight They're all good. So good! Number three eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-
Jim One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
Dwight Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
Andy  Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. Why are you doing this to me Andy? Because I hate your programs!
Todd  And a '76 that's good to boot, I like that. 
Michael And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. 
Todd Why?
Michael I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
Todd Holly said that?
Michael Yeah.
Holy She was laughing hysterically that whole time!
Michael I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
Todd She asked me, Michael! It would've been rude not to answer.
Michael You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.
Todd Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I've been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers.
Michael No it isn't.
Todd You're right. I gotta watch my behavior.
Michael Yeah, a little bit.
Todd Don't give up on me.
Michael I won't.
Michael  Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.
Kevin I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
Michael Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
Kevin That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
Michael Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
Todd I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier.
Kevin Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
Michael Kevin, do you accept the apology?
Kelly Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
Michael Okay, go back to the annex.
Kelly This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
Ryan  Sometimes you over react.
Oscar Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
Todd Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius.
Michael That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
Angela  No! Don't!
Michael I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
Pam  So listen, we have to really scuff this up.
Andy No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.
Pam Andy, this is the deal we made.
Andy  That's probably good. That's enough.
Pam We should break this hinge maybe.
Andy Let's not go crazy.
Todd Well thanks, will do.
Jim  Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. 
Todd That sounds weird.
Jim It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
Dwight  And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
Jim  Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
Dwight Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
Todd Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd.
Dwight Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
Michael What are you doing?
Jim  All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! 
Michael I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?
Jim He's a jerk.
Dwight He took my desk.
Michael Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?
Dwight It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
Michael You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
Dwight No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
Michael He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
Jim Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? 
Andy  Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
Pam Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
Andy Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?
Pam Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. 
Andy All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. 
Todd  You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the "ass", in Tallahassee!
Michael Yes, about that.
Todd Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!
Michael Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.
Todd Do you have a ball and chain?
Michael No, nothing like that at all.
Todd Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend, man. She's uptight.
Michael Sorry?
Todd I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local talent.
Michael  Sounds great.
Todd It's gonna be so good.
Michael That is. It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
Holly I'm sorry about your friend.
Michael Nah, he's an ass.
Holly  You ahh.
Michael  You ahh.
Holly What ah you wicked smaht?
Michael No you ahh.
Holly Who ahh?
Michael  You ahh.
Daryl So this new computer you found in the warehouse.
Pam Yep. Lucked out.
Daryl Yeah, you really did. 'Cause I know every INCH of that warehouse.
Pam Yep, super lucky.
Daryl Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days.
Pam  Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
Daryl Really? 'Cause I think maybe I saw five.
Pam Three. 
Pam I'm full on corrupt!

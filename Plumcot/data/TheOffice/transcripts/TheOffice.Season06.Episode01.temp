Michael  Parkour!
Dwight & Andy 
Andy Parkour!
Dwight  Extreme! Parkour!
Jim This... is Parkour. Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
Dwight 
Dwight & Andy  Parkour! Parkour!
Dwight Andy! Leapfrog! 
Andy Do me! Do me!
Dwight Yeah! Parkour! Parkour!
Andy Ow! Get off! Get off!
Dwight Okay.
Andy & Michael  Parkour! Parkour!
Dwight  Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! 
Michael  Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
Andy Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.
Michael & Dwight  Yeah! Gainer! Woohoo!
Andy  Hardcore Parkour!
Michael Parkoooooour!
Dwight Let's do it!
Andy 
Michael & Dwight 
Andy  Parkour!
Dwight  Good. Excellent. Thank you.
Female Intern  There you go. Is there anything else I can do?
Dwight  Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?
Female Intern  Mm hmm.
Dwight Go put them all in random order.
Female intern  Mm-kay.
Dwight Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
Pam This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident. He didn't do anything sexual. He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.
Meredith  Think she did him?
Oscar I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
Kelly If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.
Michael  Who's getting married?
Pam Nobody.
Michael If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming.
Kelly It's Eric and Megan.
Michael Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.
Phyllis They're not getting married. It's just talk.
Michael Did everybody know about this but me?
Phyllis There's nothing to know, it's just gossip.
Michael  Okay... okay. 
Pam  We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant.
Jim Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
Pam Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.
Jim Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?
Pam Nope.
Jim No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything.
Pam Can't back out now, Halpert.
Jim What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
Pam No, keep it up.
Michael  You'll never guess what I know.
Dwight  Okay, let me finish this thought.
Michael Eric likes Megan.
Dwight  He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
Michael  How do you know this?
Dwight  People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?
Michael I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?
Michael  Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said "The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle."
Maurie What are you talking about?
Michael I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
Maurie At Tink's?
Michael Yes
Maurie How'd you know about that?
Michael Well...
Maurie Did Stanley tell you?
Michael  Stanley was on your group date?
Maurie No, Stanley was with his wife. I waved at him, but he didn't wave back.
Michael  Does anybody else know about this?
Maurie No.
Michael 
Michael There he goes. There he goes. 
Michael So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?
Dwight, Jim & Pam 
Michael Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say...
Pam Just keep it to yourself then.
Michael Stanly is having a midlife crisis.
Dwight Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
Michael Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
Phyllis Teri's out of town, Michael.
Michael Who?
Phyllis Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
Michael 
Michael  You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.
Maurie What are you talking about?
Michael Stanley's wife is out of town.
Maurie He was with somebody.
Eric He was definitely with somebody.
Michael Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?
Eric 
Michael  I don't get it!
Eric If that was his sister, then what they were doing was totally illegal.
Michael Drugs?
Eric Making out.
Michael  Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.
Michael  Stanley is having an affir.
Kelly WHAT??
Michael I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.
Michael  That and that are the same letter.
Kevin Q.
Michael No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?
Kevin T.
Michael T! Yes! Yes! That is a "T", and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there.
Michael  Hey, Stanley! Where you goin', big guy? Up to no good?
Stanley I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
Michael No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?
Stanley Goodbye. 
Michael Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.
Jim  You have to stop this.
Michael  Did you hear Stanley's having an affair?
Jim I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
Michael Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser...
Jim Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
Michael 
Michael  Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real. Stanley, are you having an affair?
Stanley  That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
Michael So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
Stanley  Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
Michael  So stupid!
Stanley It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...
Michael I know, I know.
Stanley And it's been lonely.
Michael Oh, I bet.
Stanley Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...
Michael Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?
Stanley Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
Michael Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool.
Stanley I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
Michael  I'm not saying... a damn thing.
Stanley I'm counting on you, Michael.
Michael  You can count on me.
Stanley 
Michael  Oh, that smells good.
Kevin I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
Michael Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.
Kevin Yeah... what do you mean exactly?
Michael Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike.
Kevin Reeeeally.
Michael Uh huh. Alright?
Michael How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including "Stanley is having an affair." It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.
Erin Kelly has an eating disorder?
Michael Yeah.
Erin She always eats my lunch.
Michael Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.
Erin We should do something.
Michael Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.
Michael  I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here.
Kelly Really?
Michael Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.
Kelly Andy Bernard??
Michael Mm hmm.
Michael  Did you hear Pam is pregnant?
Meredith Really?
Michael Yeah!
Meredith She's gonna hate being a mom.
Andy 
Kevin 
Andy What?
Kevin  Tea.
Andy So?
Kevin You would.
Andy  I like tea!
Kevin  Oh, I bet you like it.
Andy Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!
Kevin Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
Andy WHAT??
Kevin Because you're gay.
Andy  Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?
Andy This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. But it makes you wonder.
Andy  Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?
Oscar  I did. Yes.
Andy And?
Oscar What?
Andy Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?
Oscar Are you attracted to other men?
Andy  No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like.
Oscar 
Andy Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?
Oscar If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
Andy It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario.
Oscar Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
Oscar What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
Phyllis How far along is Pam?
Meredith A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.
Michael  Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.
Michael  Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.
Dwight  Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
Eric Why would we call you at night?
Dwight  Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
Jim  You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
Dwight Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.
Erin  I am so happy you're eating again.
Kelly  Me too!
Andy  Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?
Jim Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
Andy Women friends?
Jim Yep.
Andy Not guy friends?
Jim Are you... interested in her guy friends?
Andy No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.
Jim Okay.
Andy But off the record, I'm kinda confused.
Jim Really.
Andy Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like...
Jim Well you gotta figure this out.
Andy Yeah, right?
Jim Yeah!
Andy How?
Jim You gotta have s*x with a woman.
Andy Right-o.
Jim And a man.
Andy Ohh...
Jim And then compare.
Andy Alright. Well hey...
Jim Yep.
Andy Congratulations to you.
Jim On what?
Andy  Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
Jim 
Angela  Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a b*st*rd?
Pam What?
Angela Want me to say it again?
Pam Why did that come into your brain?
Jim  Can I talk to you for a second?
Jim  So, they know.
Pam Who did you tell?
Jim I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
Pam Nobody!
Creed  Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba.
Creed If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?
Oscar  What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
Toby  What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?
Jim Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
Everyone  Yes.
Michael  Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.
Jim Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
Michael That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.
Pam Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.
Kevin I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?
Creed I heard that from... Andy.
Andy I heard it from Erin.
Erin I heard it from Michael.
Michael 
Pam  Michael? He's over here!
Pam  Where are you going?
Michael Nowhere.
Dwight Michael... You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? 
Pam Don't get on it. 
Jim Michael, don't.
Pam Don't... get... on. Do not.
Jim Michael...
Kevin Stay.
Pam Step away.
Creed Come on, boss.
Michael 
Michael  Okay, I made it all up.
Everyone 
Andy Even the fact that I'm gay?
Michael Yes.
Andy  Yes!
Michael But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.
Angela No. We heard that about Jim.
Michael Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.
Angela How is that a bad rumor?
Michael Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.
Oscar Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
Stanley  You told everyone I was having an affair?
Michael Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
Kelly Well then, what's the one true rumor?
Phyllis We have a right to know.
Andy Michael... am I gay?
Michael  The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that...
Jim  That Pam's pregnant.
Angela I knew it!
Kevin I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought "Oh, she has a new bra with padding." But then I thought "Pam doesn't need padding." It just didn't add up, Jim.
Jim Okay. Thank you.
Phyllis Congratulations!
Erin That's really great, you guys.
Ryan Don't vaccinate it.
Dwight Who's the father?
Pam Jim.
Creed How far along?
Jim Four months.
Creed Who's the OB/GYN?
Pam Stop. Don't. Just...
Michael Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.
Jim Nope.
Michael Yes. Jim...
Jim  Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
Pam Yes.
Jim If everyone would like to see proof.
Pam Okay. 
Kelly Are we just gonna wait here? 
Everyone 
Kelly It's true!
Michael Look at that! That is the inside of your v*g1n*! 
Pam  It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. 
Michael  How long have you known about the pregnancy?
Jim & Pam 
Michael A week? A month? A year?
Jim Michael, we only told our parents last week.
Michael Did you pee on a stick?
Jim I did. It was inconclusive.
Michael You should've told me.
Pam  You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.
Michael 
Erin Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.
Michael 
Pam  You called Stanley's wife?
Michael Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.
Jim Don't take it.
Michael No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious.
Pam If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.
Michael No, no, I can do this.
Jim You can't do this.
Michael Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.
Jim That sounds terrible.
Pam Michael, please don't.
Michael  Hey, what up, Cynthia? 
Jim 
Michael Hold on a second, Cynthia.
Jim 
Michael Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly. Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you can't stop love, I guess and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try.
Maurie  I learned that a company can describe their internship as "full of exciting experiences," even if that's a lie. There's no regulation.
Megan I learned that half these people's email password is "password."
Eric I learned that a ream of paper is 300 sheets.
Megan I thought it was 500.
Eric Oh... I guess I didn't learn anything.
Maurie I learned that if you look even the tiniest bit like Jet Li, Michael will call you "Jet Li" all summer.
Megan  Julia Stiles.
Eric  Alan Thicke.

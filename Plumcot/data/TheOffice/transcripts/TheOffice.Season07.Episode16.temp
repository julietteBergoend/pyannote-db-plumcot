Delivery Guy I got a delivery for ya'. 
Michael Leave it at reception. 
Delivery I'm supposed to deliver this one in person. 
Michael  Clean up on aisle five. 
Michael After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level Midnight. 
Michael Erin... what are you doing? 
Erin Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it. 
Michael That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth. 
Jim Threat Level Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott. 
Pam We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie. 
Jim Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie! 
Pam Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. Everything pointed to it being a comedy. 
Pam We'd love to see it! 
Michael Sweet, I will go invite Holly. 
Pam Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay? 
Creed Thanks mom. 
Holly You never told me you made a movie. 
Michael Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom. 
Holly It's got you. 
Michael It's got a lot of me. 
Holly  I can't wait. 
Michael Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level Midnight. 
Narrator  Michael Scarn, well that's an interesting story. He was once the best secret agent in the business. That was years ago. Where is he now? Well, that's also an interesting story. 
Samuel  Master Scarn. 
Dwight I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- to be like this! But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person. 
Michael Dwight does not play a robot. 
Samuel  
Michael  I'm up. 
Samuel It's the president. He needs you for a mission. 
Michael Tell him I'm retired. 
Dwight It's Goldenface. 
Michael Goldenface, this makes it personal. 
President  Scarn, you're right on time. 
Daryl I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it'd be good for my daughter to see a black man as president. Even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time. 
President It's your old enemy, Goldenface. He's after the NHL All Star Game. He's hidden a bomb somewhere in the stadium. Scarn, this one is personal for me. I own the stadium. I can't see it blown up. It's my retirement plan. 
Samuel We have to search the stadium. 
President Not so fast, Goldenface has taken all the concession stand workers hostage. Scarn, will you find these hostages, and save the game? 
Michael  Heads I do it, tails I don't. Best out of seven. Heads. Tails. ...Heads...Tails...Heads...Tails. Well, it looks like there's going to be a clean-up on aisle five. 
Narrator Well, the hostages were scared. 
Kevin  Don't you guys get it? Nobody's coming for us. 
Goldenface  Oh someone's coming alright, the only man who would care. Michael Scarn. See I'm gonna lure him here, then I kill everybody, then... I'm gonna dig up Scarn's dead wife, and I'm gonna hump her real good. 
Jim I did not love the dialogue. Or the character. I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless. 
Narrator  Well, the All Star Game was three days away, so naturally it was all sold out. The only way Scarn was getting in was in a uniform. Just one problem with that, Scarn didn't know a hockey stick from a Slim Jim. So he went to meet with the famed trainer... Cherokee Jack. Cherokee 
Jack  Mop the ice. 
Michael I'm not here to learn how to mop, I'm here to learn how to play hockey. Cherokee 
Jack Mop it. Now take this. 
Michael What am I supposed to do with this? Cherokee 
Jack Mop. 
Narrator Well, Michael Scarn was quickly becoming one of the hottest hockey players in the country. 
Ryan  Each year, the National Hockey League selects one civilian amateur to play in the All Star Game. It's down to the three of you. The final test is speed skating. On your marks, get set... 
Goldenface Die! 
Michael  Nice try Goldenface, but you forgot one thing, to kill me. 
Goldenface I wasn't trying to kill you, I was trying to slow you down. 
Michael No! 
Goldenface Oh by the way! 
Michael Yeah? 
Goldenface How's your wife doing? 
Michael  
Michael Congratulations. 
Oscar Hey, you came in second. Not bad either. 
Michael I am sorry that I have to do this... 
Oscar Huh... 
Michael I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. 
Samuel I'm intercepting a name. Jasmine Winsong. She works for Goldenface. What I can't figure out is, who is the Funky Cat. 
Michael Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest Jazz Club in town. 
Samuel Oh- 
Dwight He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me? 
Jan  They call me Jasmine Winsong. 
Michael  Bingo. 
Jan He finished his movie? No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him. 
Jan  
Michael  
Jan  The hostages are under the stadium. 
Michael Jack Blaise. 
Pam You have to let us go Goldenface! We have families! 
Goldenface Ha! This is gonna show them that I mean business. See ya! 
Michael By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story. 
Samuel Ha! 
Kevin Michael Scarn! 
Goldenface Sorry about your friend, Scarn! 
Michael The joke's on you Goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist. 
Goldenface  
Samuel We've searched the whole building, Goldenface, where is the bomb? 
Goldenface Hm? 
Samuel We've searched the whole building, Goldenface, where is the bomb? 
Goldenface Hm? 
Samuel We've searched the wh- ok... 
Michael He said, where is the bomb? 
Goldenface In the puck! 
Michael Why are you telling me this? 
Goldenface Because I'm going to kill you. Unless! You forgive me for murdering your wife. 
Michael Hey Goldenface. 
Goldenface Yeah? 
Michael Go puck yourself! 
Goldenface  
Samuel Noooo! 
Michael That was not scripted. 
Goldenface  
Michael More Tylenol. 
Helene  You've already had four. 
Pam Oh God... So good. 
Helene You're lucky to be alive. 
Michael It'll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn. 
Helene Let's just make sure that everything's... Working properly... 
President You just said the bomb... is in the puck? Michael and Samuel 
together Yes. 
President Is that where you hid the bomb Goldenface? 
Goldenface  
Samuel But why would you blow up the stadium? You OWN the stadium! 
Michael For the insurance money! I knew it all along! You will never get away with this! 
Michael Where had I gone wrong? All I wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife. But somewhere along the way, things got messed up. 
Narrator It wasn't easy for Scarn to admit that he had lost his self-confidence. And he hadn't of course, He just wasn't using it right now. 
Michael  Beer me Billy. 
Billy  You don't looks so good, what's got ya down? 
Michael I got problems Billy. Big problems... 
Billy You got problems?! My TV don't work! I pay thirty bucks a month for the damn satellite what's-a-whosit, I can't even get the damn game! Now you tell me, what's worse than that? 
Michael  Don't ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow. 
Billy I see what you mean about problems. I know what'll cheer you up. That table of bachelorettes over there bought you this drink. 
Karen Ever banged an entire bachelorette party, baby? 
Karen Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later? 
Michael I'm too depressed to save the big game Billy. 
Billy I'm gonna cheer you up, the only ways I know hows. Hey kid! Hit G-9 on the Jukebox! 
Michael No Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died. 
Billy There is a whole crowd of people out there, who need to learn, how to do The Scarn. 
Michael  Well my name's Michael Scarn and I'm here to say, I'm about to do The Scarn in a major way. You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! Todd 
Packer  If doing The Scarn is gay, then I'm the biggest queer on Earth! 
Jim  Sorry. 
Michael  
Jim I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back. 
Kelly Yeah Michael the movie is amazing! 
Kevin It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. 
Ryan You should enter it in festivals! 
Kevin Or carnivals! 
Michael  Well that's a... pretty good reaction. Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that? 
Holly Uh... which part? 
Michael Okay. No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough... 
Andy Some people are really popping on screen! 
Michael Hey. 
Holly Hey! Good movie. 
Michael Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great! 
Holly I loved it. 
Michael Did you? What did you love about it? 
Holly Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that? 
Michael No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly. 
Holly Uhm... 
Michael Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded. 
Holly Not worried about that. 
Michael  It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream. 
Holly Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before! 
Michael I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus. 
Holly Well why do you have to make a movie at all? 
Michael Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing. 
Holly Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have? 
Michael I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie. 
Holly I'm real. 
Michael Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you. 
Holly I love you too. 
Michael I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films. Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans. 
Michael Who likes Threat Level Midnight? Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! 
Samuel Michael! You have to get to that puck before halftime! Or the whole stadium will explode! 
Michael I know, it's a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on! 
Samuel Cherokee Jack? Michael he died. 
Michael  This one's for you Cherokee Jack. 
Michael We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states. 
Jim  That's fine, it's great! 
Michael No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. 
Pam Why is your face gold? 
Goldenface Why do you care? 
Pam I'm just making conversation. 
Goldenface I worked in a gold factory, we had a boss, who only cared about money... 
Michael Hey... 
Holly Hey, I'm sorry. It is good. 
Michael No it's not. It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it. 
Hostage Please Goldenface, let us go! 
Michael  Cherokee Jack. Cherokee 
Jack I want you to take all of your frustrations, with women, the system, with everything. Take it out on the puck. All on the puck. 
Michael  
Michael  
Samuel Yah!  
Billy Hey! We got sports games again! 
Goldenface  Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh- 
Michael  Some breakfast for me and some breakfast for you. 
Michael Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot. 
Michael  I'll get it! Man I love being retired! Scarn here! 
President  Michael, it's the president. 
Michael Hello sir. 
President I need you for another mission. 
Michael Ugh... I'm in. 
Andy  Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil? 
Michael Oh yeah! Yes he is! 
Dwight No no, he's doing it to catch the president! 
Michael No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. 
Narrator  Well, Michael Scarn was back in the game. And I bet you're wondering why do I know so much about Michael Scarn. Well because I AM Michael Scarn. 
Rapper  Ahhhh, yeah! Threat Level Midnight! Makes all the girlies feel alright! From Madonna to Madelyn Allbrite, Threat Level Midnight! It's a threat, a level, a level level threat. He's the greatest hockey-star I ever seen yet. Threat Level what? Midnight! Threat Level who? Michael Scarn! Threat Level why? Apartheid! Gotta fight it, Free Mandela! Peace I'm out!

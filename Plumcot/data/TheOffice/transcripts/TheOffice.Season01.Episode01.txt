michael_scott All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
jim_halpert Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
michael_scott So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?
jim_halpert Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
michael_scott All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.
michael_scott Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... So that's the way it's done.
michael_scott I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?
pam_beesly Well. I don't know.
michael_scott If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago.
pam_beesly What?
michael_scott Any messages?
pam_beesly Uh, yeah. Just a fax.
michael_scott Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
pam_beesly You haven't told me.
michael_scott It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
michael_scott People say I am the best boss. They go, "God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious." "And you get the best out of us." I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.
dwight_schrute Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum
jim_halpert My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.
michael_scott Whassup!
jim_halpert Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
michael_scott Whassup!
dwight_schrute Whassup!
michael_scott Whass...up!
dwight_schrute Whassup.
michael_scott What?
jim_halpert Nothing.
michael_scott OK. All right. See you later.
jim_halpert All right. Take care.
michael_scott Back to work.
jan_levinson Just before lunch. That would be great.
michael_scott Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.
jan_levinson Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
michael_scott Um... Me no get an agenda.
jan_levinson What? I'm sorry?
michael_scott I didn't get any agenda.
jan_levinson Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
michael_scott Really? I didn't... Did we get a fax this morning?
pam_beesly Uh, yeah, the one...
michael_scott Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?
pam_beesly You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
michael_scott Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.
jan_levinson Do you want to look at mine?
michael_scott Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.
jan_levinson OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
michael_scott OK...
jan_levinson Michael, don't panic.
michael_scott No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.
jan_levinson No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.
michael_scott All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
jan_levinson I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
michael_scott OK. No problem.
jan_levinson This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
michael_scott Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
michael_scott Question. How long do we have to... Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?
jan_levinson Go ahead.
michael_scott Packman.
todd_packer Hey, you big queen.
michael_scott Oh, that's not appropriate.
todd_packer Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?
michael_scott Uh, I don't know what you mean.
todd_packer I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?
michael_scott Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.
jan_levinson So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
michael_scott No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. Like that.
phyllis_vance So what does downsizing actually mean?
stanley_hudson Well...
oscar_martinez You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
angela_martin I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
kevin_malone Yeah, it'll be you.
pam_beesly I have an important question for you.
jim_halpert Yes?
pam_beesly Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?
jim_halpert Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.
michael_scott Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
michael_scott Hey.
ryan_howard Hey.
pam_beesly This is Mr. Scott.
michael_scott Guilty! Guilty as charged!
ryan_howard Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
michael_scott Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.
ryan_howard Yup.
michael_scott Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler.
pam_beesly I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
jim_halpert Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
dwight_schrute What?
jim_halpert What are you doing?
dwight_schrute Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.
jim_halpert It's not on your desk.
dwight_schrute It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
dwight_schrute You can't do that.
jim_halpert Why not?
dwight_schrute Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
jim_halpert We'll see. This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
dwight_schrute Downsizing?
dwight_schrute Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
pam_beesly You just still have these messages from yesterday.
michael_scott Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it.
pam_beesly What?
michael_scott Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
pam_beesly Don't we all?
michael_scott I'm sorry?
pam_beesly Nothing.
michael_scott If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional.
michael_scott I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.
michael_scott People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.
michael_scott Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
dwight_schrute I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
michael_scott Assistant to the Regional Manager.
dwight_schrute OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
michael_scott I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.
oscar_martinez Can't you just tell us.
dwight_schrute Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
michael_scott You don't know what it is.
dwight_schrute OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
michael_scott I don't need your permission.
dwight_schrute Go ahead.
michael_scott Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
ryan_howard I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
oscar_martinez Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
michael_scott Not gonna happen.
stanley_hudson It could be out of your hands Michael.
michael_scott It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.
stanley_hudson Can you promise that?
dwight_schrute On his mother's grave.
michael_scott No.
phyllis_vance What?
michael_scott Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
stanley_hudson It's just that we need to know.
michael_scott I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
pam_beesly I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
office_worker Are you sure about that?
michael_scott Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
dwight_schrute Pam, information is power.
stanley_hudson You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
michael_scott No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.
jim_halpert If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
pam_beesly Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um...
michael_scott Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.
ryan_howard What's up? Nice to meet you.
michael_scott Introduce yourself. Be polite.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
michael_scott Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
dwight_schrute Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
michael_scott That's his profit.
dwight_schrute New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
dwight_schrute Damn it! Jim!
michael_scott OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
dwight_schrute He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
pam_beesly
dwight_schrute That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
dwight_schrute It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
michael_scott What is that?
dwight_schrute That is my stapler.
michael_scott No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
dwight_schrute OK you know what, you can be a witness. Can you reprimand him?
jim_halpert How do you know it was me?
dwight_schrute It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
michael_scott Discipline. Kinky! All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
michael_scott And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.
jim_halpert OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
michael_scott Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
ryan_howard You should've put him in custardy.
michael_scott Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
dwight_schrute OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
michael_scott Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.
jim_halpert Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
pam_beesly So when are we going out?
jim_halpert Tonight, hopefully.
pam_beesly OK. Yeah.
roy_anderson Hey, man.
jim_halpert What's going on?
roy_anderson Hey, baby.
pam_beesly Hey.
pam_beesly Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
pam_beesly Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
roy_anderson No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.
pam_beesly OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
jim_halpert You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
roy_anderson It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.
jim_halpert Yeah, yeah.
jim_halpert Um... What's in the bag?
roy_anderson Just tell her I'll talk to her later.
jim_halpert No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
jim_halpert Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding?
michael_scott So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?
ryan_howard Yeah.
michael_scott You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
ryan_howard All right.
michael_scott Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...
pam_beesly You got a fax.
michael_scott Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
pam_beesly What? Why?
michael_scott Why? Well, theft and stealing.
pam_beesly Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
michael_scott Post-it Notes.
pam_beesly Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
michael_scott 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
pam_beesly Are you serious?
michael_scott Yeah. I am.
pam_beesly I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
michael_scott But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
michael_scott You been X'd punk! Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.
pam_beesly You're a jerk.
michael_scott I don't know about that.
michael_scott What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, "Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
jim_halpert How are things?
pam_beesly Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...
jim_halpert Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
pam_beesly It's better, thanks.
jim_halpert Good. Good.
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert That's great
pam_beesly Is...?
jim_halpert Yeah?
pam_beesly Um... Are you...
jim_halpert Am I walking out?
pam_beesly Yes.
jim_halpert Yes, I... Do you want to...
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Great. Let me just...
jim_halpert Oh, Roy.
pam_beesly Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.
jim_halpert Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. You know what, just come here.

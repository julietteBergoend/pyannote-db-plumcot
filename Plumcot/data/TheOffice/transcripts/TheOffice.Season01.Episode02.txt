michael_scott Hey , uh , can I help you out in here ?
mr_brown Oh , I'm all set , thanks .
michael_scott Gotcha .
michael_scott Good .
michael_scott I'd go with the rows .
michael_scott That's a good idea .
michael_scott Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity .
michael_scott It's something that I've been pushing , that I've been wanting to push , for a long time and Corporate mandated it .
michael_scott And I never actually talked to Corporate about it .
michael_scott They kind of beat me to the punch , the bastards .
michael_scott But I was going to .
michael_scott And I think it's very important that we have this .
michael_scott I'm very , very excited .
jim_halpert That's the thing .
jim_halpert It's very sturdy paper and on the back
jim_halpert it says , "
jim_halpert 100% post-consumer content .
jim_halpert "
jim_halpert What ?
jim_halpert Hello ?
jim_halpert Uh-huh .

jim_halpert I don't know .
jim_halpert Hold on one second .
jim_halpert Do you really have to do that right now ?
dwight_schrute Yes I do .
dwight_schrute I should have done it weeks ago actually .
jim_halpert Mr .
jim_halpert Decker , I'm sorry about that .
jim_halpert What were you ...
jim_halpert Can you hold on one second ?
jim_halpert Yeah , just one second .
jim_halpert Thanks .

jim_halpert Perfect .
jim_halpert So what I was saying ...
jim_halpert Hello ?
jim_halpert Thanks , Dwight .
dwight_schrute Retaliation .
dwight_schrute Tit for tit .
jim_halpert That is not the expression .
dwight_schrute Well , it should be .
jim_halpert This is my biggest sale of the year .
jim_halpert They love me over there for some reason .
jim_halpert I'm not really sure why
jim_halpert but I make one call over there every year , just to renew their account , and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year , so I buy a mini bottle of champagne , celebrate a little .
jim_halpert And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more .
jim_halpert I know .
jim_halpert I'm getting cocky .
jim_halpert Right ?
jim_halpert Solitaire ?
pam_beesly Yeah , Freecell .
jim_halpert Six on seven .
pam_beesly I know .
pam_beesly I saw that .
jim_halpert So then , why didn't you do it ?
pam_beesly I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go
pam_beesly T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch .
jim_halpert Who doesn't love that ?
michael_scott Hey , Oscar !
michael_scott How are you doing , man ?
oscar_martinez All right .
michael_scott Did you have a good weekend going there ?
oscar_martinez It was fine .
michael_scott Oh yeah , I bet it was fun .
michael_scott Oh , hey !
michael_scott This is Oscar---
oscar_martinez Martinez .
michael_scott Right .
michael_scott See ?
michael_scott I don't even know , first-name basis !
mr_brown Great .
mr_brown We're all set .
michael_scott Oh hey , well , diversity , everybody , let's do it .
michael_scott Oscar works in ... here .
michael_scott Jim , could you wrap it up , please ?
jim_halpert Yeah , uh , Mr . Decker , please .
michael_scott It's diversity day , Jim .
michael_scott I wish every day was diversity day .
jim_halpert You know what ?
jim_halpert I'm actually going to have to call you back .
jim_halpert Thank you .
jim_halpert Sorry about that .
mr_brown Thank you .
mr_brown Thank you .
mr_brown Thank you .
mr_brown Great .
michael_scott Come on people , let's get 'em in .
michael_scott Get in the cards !
michael_scott Get in the cards !
mr_brown Thank you .
mr_brown Thank you very much .
mr_brown OK .
mr_brown Thanks for filling these out
mr_brown and I promise this'll be quick .
mr_brown At Diversity Today , our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations .
mr_brown We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance .
michael_scott You know what ?
michael_scott This is a color-free-zone here .
michael_scott Stanley , I don't look at you as another race .
mr_brown Uh , see this is what I'm talking about .
mr_brown We don't have to pretend we're color-blind .
michael_scott Exactly , were not ...
mr_brown That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance .
michael_scott With tolerance .
mr_brown No .
mr_brown With more ignorance .
michael_scott Ignorance .
mr_brown Right .
mr_brown Exactly .
mr_brown Uh , instead , we need to celebrate our diversity .
michael_scott Let's celebrate .
mr_brown Right .
mr_brown OK .
michael_scott Celebrate good times .
michael_scott Come on !
michael_scott Let's celebrate diversity .
michael_scott Right ?
mr_brown Yes , exactly .
mr_brown Now here's what we're going to do .
mr_brown I've noticed that ...
michael_scott You know what ?
michael_scott Here's what we're going to do .
michael_scott Why don't we go around and everybody ...
michael_scott everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually .
michael_scott I will go last .
michael_scott Go .
dwight_schrute I have two .
dwight_schrute White and Indian .
mr_brown Actually , I'd prefer not to start that way .
mr_brown Michael , I would love to have your permission to run this session .
mr_brown Can I have your permission ?
michael_scott Yes .
mr_brown Thank you very much .
mr_brown And it would also help me if you were seated .
michael_scott OK .
mr_brown Thank you .
mr_brown OK .
mr_brown Now , at the start of the session , I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace .
mr_brown Now , what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out .
dwight_schrute A few of the ground rules ?
michael_scott Hey , hey why don't you run it by me
michael_scott and I'll run it by him .
dwight_schrute OK , can we steer away from gay people ?
mr_brown Um ...
dwight_schrute I'm sorry .
dwight_schrute It's an orientation .
dwight_schrute It's not a race .
dwight_schrute Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays , so
dwight_schrute ...paradox .
mr_brown Well , we only have an hour .
dwight_schrute I figured it would save time .
michael_scott OK .
michael_scott Why don't we just defer to Mr ...
mr_brown Mr . Brown .
michael_scott Ah .
michael_scott Oh , right !
michael_scott OK .
michael_scott First test .
michael_scott I will not call you that .
mr_brown Well , it's my name .
mr_brown It's not a test .
mr_brown OK ?
mr_brown Um , so looking through the cards , I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident , which is ironic , because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to .
mr_brown Now , how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine ?
mr_brown Very good .
mr_brown OK .
michael_scott How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking
michael_scott and then I go and do the exact same routine , same comedic timing , and people file a complaint to Corporate ?
michael_scott Is it because I'm white and Chris is black ?
mr_brown So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome .
michael_scott I will play the Chris Rock guy .
michael_scott I would like to see someone else pull this off .
mr_brown Well , let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment .
michael_scott OK , I will play guy listening .
mr_brown Great .
mr_brown Guy listening .
mr_brown Ok , anyone else remember ?
kevin_malone I remember .
mr_brown Great .
mr_brown You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening .
michael_scott OK .
michael_scott Kevin is a great guy .
michael_scott He's a great accountant .
michael_scott He is not much of an entertainer .
kevin_malone Basically , there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people .
kevin_malone Every time the one type wants to have a good time , then the other type comes in and makes a real mess .
michael_scott OK .
michael_scott I'm sorry .
michael_scott I'm sorry .
michael_scott He's ruin ...
michael_scott He's butchering it .
michael_scott Could you just let me ...
michael_scott Every time ...
michael_scott Every time black people want to have a good time , some ignant ass ...
michael_scott I take care of my kid !
mr_brown Wait a second .
michael_scott They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do !
mr_brown Stop it !
michael_scott What you want a cookie ?
mr_brown Now , this is a simple acronym .
mr_brown HERO .
mr_brown Uh , at Diversity Today , we believe it is very easy to be a HERO .
mr_brown All you need are honesty , empathy , respect and open-mindedness .
dwight_schrute Excuse me , I'm sorry , but that's not all it takes to be a hero .
mr_brown Oh , great .
mr_brown Well , what is a hero to you ?
dwight_schrute A hero kills people , people that wish him harm .
mr_brown OK .
dwight_schrute A hero is part-human and part-supernatural .
dwight_schrute A hero is born out of a childhood trauma , or out of a disaster that must be avenged .
mr_brown Ok , you're thinking of a superhero .
dwight_schrute We all have a hero in our heart .
mr_brown Now , I need you to take these forms .
mr_brown This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today .
mr_brown And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge .
michael_scott I don't think I can sign this .
mr_brown I can't leave until you do .
michael_scott Well , OK , it says here that I learned something
michael_scott and I knew all this stuff already ,
michael_scott so ...
michael_scott I know , I could sign something that says that I taught something , or that I helped you teach something , so ...
michael_scott Pam !
michael_scott Where is she ?
michael_scott Pam , could we change something on this ?
mr_brown Michael , can I talk to you candidly ?
michael_scott Sure .
mr_brown We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made .
michael_scott Here's the thing .
michael_scott This office , I think this is very advanced in terms of ... racial awareness
michael_scott and it's probably more advanced than you're used to .
michael_scott That's probably throwing you off a little bit .
mr_brown Um , it's not throwing me .
mr_brown I need your signature .
michael_scott OK , well I know .
michael_scott You told me that several times .
mr_brown Yes , but you're not listening to me .
mr_brown Yours is the only signature I need .
michael_scott OK .
mr_brown Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made .
mr_brown The reason I made copies for everyone was
mr_brown so you wouldn't be embarrassed .
michael_scott Well , here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training .
michael_scott And you don't .
mr_brown Don't worry about dating .
michael_scott I won't .
mr_brown OK .
mr_brown Thank you .
michael_scott Yeah ,
michael_scott yeah .
michael_scott " I regret my actions .
michael_scott I regret offending my coworkers .
michael_scott I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty , empathy , respect and open-mindedness ... "
michael_scott Open-mindedness , is that even a word ? " ...into the workplace .
michael_scott In this way , I can truly be a hero .
michael_scott Signed , Daffy Duck . "
michael_scott He's going to lose it when he reads that .
jim_halpert Yeah , hi .
jim_halpert Is Mr . Decker around ?
jim_halpert Oh , well , could you just have him call me after lunch ?
jim_halpert Thank you .
michael_scott " I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart .
michael_scott " I do believe ...
michael_scott in that part of the pledge
michael_scott I that just read .
michael_scott But a pledge ?
michael_scott Come on .
michael_scott I mean who are we , the Girl Scouts ?
michael_scott No .
michael_scott Look ...
michael_scott the guy , " Mr . Brown
michael_scott , " he got us halfway there .
michael_scott He got us talking .
michael_scott Well , no .
michael_scott I got us talking .
michael_scott He got us nothing .
michael_scott He insulted us and he abandoned us .
michael_scott You call that diversity training ?
michael_scott I don't .
michael_scott Were there any connections between any of us ?
michael_scott Did anyone look each other in the eye ?
michael_scott Was there any emotion going on ?
michael_scott No .
michael_scott Where was the heart ?
michael_scott I didn't see any heart .
michael_scott Where was my Oprah moment ?
michael_scott OK , get as much done as you can before lunch because , afterward , I'm going to have you all in tears .
michael_scott All right ?
michael_scott Everybody pretty ?
michael_scott Come on .
michael_scott Here we go .
michael_scott It's time .
michael_scott Let's do some good .
toby_flenderson Hey , we're not all going to sit in a circle
toby_flenderson Indian style are we ?
michael_scott Get out .
toby_flenderson I'm sorry .
michael_scott No , this is not a joke .
michael_scott OK ?
michael_scott That was offensive and lame .
michael_scott So double offensive .
michael_scott This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here .
michael_scott OK , let's go .
michael_scott Let's do it .
michael_scott Come on .
michael_scott Let's have some fun , everybody .
michael_scott Here we go .
michael_scott Take a seat .
michael_scott Cop a squat .
michael_scott And um ... thanks for coming in .
michael_scott Um ...
michael_scott Diversity ... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said .
michael_scott But don't take my word for it .
michael_scott Let's take a look at the tape .
michael_scott Hi .
michael_scott I'm Michael Scott .
michael_scott I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton , Pennsylvania but I
michael_scott 'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow , because today is almost over .
michael_scott Abraham Lincoln once said that , " If you're a racist , I will attack you with the North . "
michael_scott And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace .
michael_scott OK .
michael_scott Questions ?
michael_scott Comments ?
michael_scott Anybody ?
michael_scott Jim ?
jim_halpert Uh , is that it ?
michael_scott Yes .
michael_scott I only had an hour to put it together
michael_scott but I'm going to add on to it later on .
kevin_malone It was kind of hard to hear .

michael_scott That probably had something to do with the camera work .
michael_scott Anybody else ?

michael_scott But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian .
oscar_martinez What part Native American ?
michael_scott Two fifteenths .
oscar_martinez Two fifteenths , that fraction doesn't make any sense .
michael_scott Well , you know what , it's kind of hard for me to talk about it .
michael_scott Their suffering .
michael_scott So who else ?
michael_scott Let's get this popping .

michael_scott Um ...
michael_scott And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead .
michael_scott OK ?

michael_scott This is real life .
michael_scott And ... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly .
michael_scott Get 'er done .
michael_scott Why ?

dwight_schrute Oh , man , am I a woman ?
michael_scott You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab .
michael_scott I thought that would be too explosive .
michael_scott No pun intended .

stanley_hudson It's collard greens .

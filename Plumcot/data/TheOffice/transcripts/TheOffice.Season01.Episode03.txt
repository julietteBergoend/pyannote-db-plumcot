jan_levinson The Gold Plan ?
jan_levinson I'm not even on that plan .
michael_scott Well , I'd recommend it .
michael_scott It's very good .
jan_levinson Michael .
michael_scott You gotta crack these things open .
jan_levinson You know the whole reason that we're doing this , is to save money .
jan_levinson So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan .
michael_scott Well , that is kind of a tough assignment .
michael_scott Um ... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice .
jan_levinson It's your job .

michael_scott Ah .
michael_scott There's a decision that needs to be made , and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day .
michael_scott So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers .
jim_halpert Gosh .
michael_scott Yeah !
jim_halpert That is a great offer .
jim_halpert Thank you .
jim_halpert I really think I should be concentrating on sales .
michael_scott Really ?
jim_halpert Yeah .
jim_halpert I just don't think this is the kind of task , that I ... am going to do .
jim_halpert You know who would be great for this ?
jim_halpert Any time Michael asks me to do anything , I just tell him that Dwight should do it .
dwight_schrute Yes .
dwight_schrute I can do it .
dwight_schrute I'm your man .
jim_halpert Right now , this is just a job .
jim_halpert If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career .
jim_halpert And uh , well , if this were my career , I'd have to throw myself in front of a train .
dwight_schrute OK , first , let's go over some parameters .
dwight_schrute How many people can I fire ?
michael_scott Ah , none .
michael_scott You're picking a health care plan .
dwight_schrute OK , we'll table that for the time being .
dwight_schrute Two , I'll need an office .
dwight_schrute I think the conference room should be fine .
michael_scott You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace .
dwight_schrute Yes , I have an office .
dwight_schrute Bigger than his .
michael_scott Nope , you cannot use it .
dwight_schrute OK , I take it back , it's a workspace .
michael_scott Temporary workspace .
michael_scott You can use it .
dwight_schrute Thank you .
michael_scott If Dwight fails , then that is strike two , and good for me for , ah , for giving him a second chance .
michael_scott And if he succeeds , then , you know , no one will be prouder than I am .
michael_scott I groomed him .
michael_scott I made him what he is today .
michael_scott Unless he fails , and we've talked about that already .
dwight_schrute What did I do ?
dwight_schrute I did my job .
dwight_schrute I slashed benefits to the bone .
dwight_schrute I saved this company money .
dwight_schrute Was I too harsh ?
dwight_schrute Maybe .
dwight_schrute I don't believe in coddling people .
dwight_schrute In the wild , there is no health care .
dwight_schrute In the wild , health care is , " Ow , I hurt my leg .
dwight_schrute I can't run .
dwight_schrute A lion eats me and I'm dead .
dwight_schrute "
dwight_schrute Well , I'm not dead .
dwight_schrute I'm the lion .

dwight_schrute Don't need it .
dwight_schrute Never been sick .
dwight_schrute Perfect immune system .
jim_halpert OK , well , if you've never been sick , then you don't have any antibodies .
dwight_schrute I don't need them .
dwight_schrute Superior genes .
dwight_schrute I'm a Schrute .
dwight_schrute And superior brain power .
dwight_schrute Through concentration , I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will .
pam_beesly Why would you want to raise your cholesterol ?
dwight_schrute So I can lower it .

travel_agent You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft ?
travel_agent It's not really a ride .
michael_scott Its says here that it's a 300ft drop .

dwight_schrute And until that time , there will be no health care coverage for any one !
jim_halpert Killer nanorobots ?
pam_beesly It's an epidemic .
dwight_schrute The problem , Jim , is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need , because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff . "
dwight_schrute Count Choculitis "
jim_halpert Sounds tough .
dwight_schrute Why did you write that down Jim ?

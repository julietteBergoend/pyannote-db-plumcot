Pam W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
Jim So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
Pam Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
Jim Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
Pam Nature.
Oscar Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
Andy I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.
Kevin  I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
Pam Some of us like the walk more than others.
Kevin  Hurts like hell.
Pam  Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
Michael Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.
Pam But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
Pam Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. I really want it.
Michael  Have you ever seen this woman?
Pam Her?
Michael Hmm...
Pam The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
Michael Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
Pam Or in a great chair.
Michael Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?
Pam I definitely remember your dinner party.
Michael I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
Pam Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.
Michael What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
Michael Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. 
Creed  Yo, is this his new chair?
Pam  No, he hasn't picked one yet.
Creed  Daat!
Creed When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go.
Michael I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.
Andy I left my cell phone in my car.
Phyllis Call us when you get there so we know you're OK. 
Michael  Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?
Kevin If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
Michael I thought that you were engaged?
Kevin Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
Michael Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?
Kevin Not anymore.
Michael Oh...
Kevin It's a bitter situation.
Michael Yeah... ugh. She's... you don't deserve her. Alright.
Michael  Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm...
Phyllis Michael?
Michael What?
Phyllis I have a friend who's single.
Michael Oh.
Phyllis Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
Michael Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?
Phyllis Umm, no, she's a professional softball player.
Michael Oooo. Catcher or in field?
Phyllis Umm I don't know Michael.
Michael Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?
Phyllis What are you asking?
Michael I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? It bothers me that you're not answering the question.
Phyllis No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
Michael Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!
Michael What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.
Michael Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.
Angela I don't think that this is---
Michael Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear "Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la." No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.
Dwight  Write legibly people.
Andy Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
Michael Hmm..
Andy It's like a ten minute walk.
Kevin No, thirty.
Michael Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. OK, yes that would be bad.
Kevin Yes.
Andy Yes.
Michael That would be bad.
Andy OK.
Kevin Nice.
Andy ...So help us out.
Michael Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.
Kevin Michael, please he--
Michael What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
Andy We won't let you down.
Michael Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.
Stanley There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
Phyllis Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
Pam  Who are you putting down?
Jim Oh, you don't know her.
Pam Who is it?
Jim Your mom.
Pam Yeah, whatever.  Give it to me. Give it to me.
Michael Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try. 
Wendy's phone operator Wendy's.
Michael Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael.
Wendy's phone operator This isn't Wendy.
Michael Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?
Wendy's phone operator Dude, this is a Wendy's restaurant.
Michael  Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
Wendy's phone operator You have to come to the restaurant to order food.
Michael Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.
Wendy's phone operator It's ready now.
Michael Well put it aside.  Umm... yeah.
Dwight OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
Michael Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...
Dwight I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
Michael That sounds good. Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.
Dwight  That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
Dwight The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
Michael She's dead? She's so young.
Dwight She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
Michael Oh, God. Oh...
Dwight Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. Here we go. Yeah.
Jim Michael, you didn't even know her.
Michael Try not to be so hurtful Jim.
Dwight Jim, how dare you. 
Michael Please, not at a time like this. 
Pam OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.
Michael Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?
Pam No, I mean it. She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. 
Michael I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?
Pam I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.
Michael No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again.
Kevin We need to assemble the five families.
Michael  No, not the five families.
Kevin We have to.
Kevin The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him "Cool Guy Paul." W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
Michael  Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now.
Kevin  I'm calling the meeting anyway.
Michael  Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette . Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady. 
Margaret Michael?
Michael  Ugh.
Margaret Are you Michael Scott?
Michael Is who a Michael what?
Margaret Oh, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm supposed to be meeting someone named Michael.
Michael Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK...
Coffee shop worker Michael? Michael? Large hot chocolate with caramel and a shot of peppermint.
Michael So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...
Margaret You're asking what I do with the checks that people write to me?
Michael Just making conversation.
Michael Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?
Margaret I don't know.
Michael You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. Look at that.
Margaret She's beautiful.
Michael Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know.
Jan  Michael? Hello? Michael? 
Margaret I'm gonna head out.
Michael Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.
Margaret That's incredibly rude.
Michael Now you ruined it. 
Bob Vance Where's Scott?
Andy Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
W.B. Jones Let's just meet back in an hour.
Andy Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.
Kevin  I... have... things...
W.B. Jones Alright, what do you want?
Andy Well first of all, I'd just like to say what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen.
W.B. Jones You have about ten seconds---
Kevin We want our parking spaces back!
Paul Faust Whose parking spaces?
Kevin W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
Bill Cress Ohh... God...
Paul I don't have time for this you guys. Just give 'em back their spaces.
W.B. Jones OK.
Paul We good? OK. Could have done this over e-mail.
Kevin After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... It's just nice to win one.
Michael Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?
Pam She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
Michael Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...
Jim  Margaret?
Pam I know.
Jim You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. 
Pam Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.
Jim Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
Pam Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.
Jim OK, sure. Let's do it. 
Pam No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged.
Jim Have I not proposed to you, yet?
Pam Hmm, I don't, know...
Jim Oh, well, that's coming. 
Pam Oh, right now?
Jim No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
Pam OK, so then, when?
Jim Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
Pam Oh, right, yeah.
Jim Wait, I'm serious. It's happening.
Pam Ohh kay.
Jim And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
Pam I've been warned.
Jim I am not kidding. Got it a week after we started dating.
Michael I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... 
Dwight You know what you need? Closure.
Michael You're right. What do you mean though?
Dwight There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
Michael Hmm.
Dwight Come on. I'll drive.
Kevin We did it.
Andy  I did it.
Kevin We got our spaces back.
Oscar Wow. 
Pam Nice job.
Jim Nice. 
Andy Yeah, there it is. You're welcome.
Andy Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park.
Michael  How did she die?
Dwight I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
Michael God.
Dwight Yeah.
Michael She was so innocent.
Dwight She was stoned apparently.
Michael You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?
Dwight You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
Michael Oh, you move on.
Dwight Yeah.
Jim Where do you want to go for dinner?
Pam I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what , that one...
Jim Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
Pam  I hate you. 
Jim What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
Pam Oh, oh.
Jim No, no, no.
Pam How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
Michael  Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off and die?
Michael/Dwight  OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
Michael Return.
Dwight Rhythm and blues...
Michael This'll be the day that I died.

Toby I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.
Meredith I love camping. Anything can happen.
Toby Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat. 
Michael Morning.
Toby Michael.
Pam Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a "get to know you" weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.
Pam Did you sleep in cabins?
Toby Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.
Phyllis Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once. 
Phyllis Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.
Pam Who went?
Toby Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, "No more s'mores, no more s'mores." 
Toby Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience 
Michael  Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
Toby Michael wasn't invited.
Michael Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? Not real.
Jim Got it.
Michael So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
Jim Absolutely, yes.
Jim When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
Michael Really?
Jim Yeah?
Michael Oh, you wanna go today?
Jim And I am always busy.
Jim Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
Michael How often can you actually donate blood?
Jim Is there a limit?
Michael Your body only has a certain amount.
Jim Well, is that it? Or?
Michael Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.
Jim How so?
Michael A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? 
Jim What's that?
Michael Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---
Jim Right.
Michael In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
Jim Not gonna change.
Michael I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.
Jim I thought we had that looked at.
Michael I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.
Michael When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called "Survivorman." And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.
Michael OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.
Dwight  I'm on it. 
Michael OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. Hey, what...
Dwight Let's see if any of these will work. 
Michael Hey, hey hey! Dwight. . Dwight.
Dwight I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, "Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place." Well I say, "It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose."
Michael Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.
Pam Do you want me to ask where you're going?
Michael No.
Pam Great.
Michael Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
Pam Oh.
Michael Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.
Jim Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
Michael Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.
Jim OK, great.
Michael This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.
Jim Yup.
Michael When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.
Jim That'd be great.
Dwight Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way no, I do not.
Michael This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.
Dwight No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
Michael Well, yes I would. And I would survive.
Dwight I would make sure that you were dead.
Michael Well...
Dwight First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
Michael You...
Dwight And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
Michael You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. OK.
Dwight What are you doing?
Michael I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- Ow! What are you doing?
Dwight It would be better if you were unconscious.
Michael No! Gosh! Dwight. Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
Dwight Do you want to do this right or not?
Michael Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
Angela Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.
Jim Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?
Angela Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?
Jim I do remember, yeah.
Angela It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
Jim You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
Angela What?
Jim There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
Michael  Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.
Jim And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to "Happy Birthday." And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
Michael  Happy Birthday!
Kelly Ahhh!! 
Michael  Happy Birthday!
Oscar Ahhh! 
Michael  Happy Birthday!
Phyllis Oh! 
Jim So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
Jim We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
Angela I don't like it. 
Pam Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?
Jim It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
Pam Do you think it's a good idea?
Jim No... I think it's a great idea.
Pam  Hmm.
Dwight We're here. 
Michael Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
Dwight  Here we go. Just the two of us 
Dwight Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
Dwight Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.
Jim You know, try sending them another invoice.
Oscar Ok.
Jim Alright. Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
Oscar  "Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today." This is really cool.
Jim Right? I was just thinking...
Oscar No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
Jim Right! Exactly. Knew I could count on you. 
Dwight Good a spot as any. 
Michael What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --
Dwight I'm just --
Michael Stop.
Dwight Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. Behold.
Michael Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.
Dwight Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.
Michael Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. 
Dwight Good luck, Michael.
Michael Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. 
Meredith Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?
Jim What's that?
Meredith I really prefer devils food cake.
Jim Oh, sure.
Meredith Yes!
Jim OK. 
Pam Wow! That was easy.
Jim Yeah, people like me I guess.
Creed  Jim.
Creed I hate devils food.
Jim Well I think Meredith was just --
Creed Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday.
Jim Everybody's birthday.
Creed Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.
Jim What do you want?
Creed I want pie. I want peach pie.
Jim You want a birthday pie?
Creed I want a nice cobbler.
Jim Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
Creed I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen.
Jim It will be Angela.
Creed You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.
Michael  Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...
Dwight I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
Michael There we go. Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts .
Michael I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. 
Michael See, this is a beautiful piece of material This could be used for all sorts of things.
Michael Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.
Andy Tuna. 
Jim Andy.
Andy Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.
Jim Not your birthday.
Andy Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.
Jim Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
Andy Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up.
Jim Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
Andy Loud and clear. 
Jim Alright. 
Andy Pizza rolls.
Jim OK, I'm gonna go into this office here to do some work. So I will be in here.
Andy Mushroom caps.
Michael I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter.
Dwight Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. I hope he finds it. Lunch.
Michael Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.
Dwight About two more minutes .
Michael I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.
Meredith What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?
Kevin Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
Stanley I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
Oscar Why don't you just have an apple?
Stanley Why don't you mind your business?
Creed Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care.
Oscar Probably went to his head.
Creed Yeah. 
Oscar Hey, Jim.
Jim Hey guys, what're we talking about?
Creed Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
Michael Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.
Dwight Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... on.
Toby  Hey Jim.
Jim Toby.
Toby Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.
Jim Oh, thanks man.
Toby Yeah...
Jim Is there anything --
Toby My birthday was two months ago.
Jim Oh, OK.
Toby There was no party.
Jim What?
Toby Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4 58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.
Jim I remember that.
Toby I don't know, I just thought you could include me.
Jim Seriously?
Toby I just though you could add me. I don't see the harm in that.
Jim Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
Jim OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
Angela No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
Toby I'm allergic to mushrooms.
Jim That's a bummer. OK, then we need to... Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please? 'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
Pam  Conference room?
Jim Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.
Angela What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
Kevin Oh, I'll take 'em.
Creed Well nobody's touching my cobbler.
Phyllis  Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.
Jim Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
Michael Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. 
Dwight Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. 
Everybody Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. 
Michael Yeah! Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something.
Michael Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. I can also make it the sky.
Michael Hey, buddy.
Jim Hey.
Michael What up?
Jim Sure glad you're back.
Michael You are relieved.
Jim You have no idea.
Michael So what did I miss?
Jim Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
Michael Oh.
Jim So, terrible idea.
Michael Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.
Jim You did do it?
Michael Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.
Jim Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
Michael That's what I said. That's what she said.
Jim That's what who said?
Michael I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.
Jim That's what she said.
Michael Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.

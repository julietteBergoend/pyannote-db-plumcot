oscar_martinez Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I'm having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she's cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it's business as usual.
oscar_martinez Good morning.
angela_martin Oscar... can I ask you a question?
oscar_martinez Of course, ask me a que-- questions.
angela_martin Is it cool in here to you?
oscar_martinez Yes, a little bit. Yes.
angela_martin I think the thermostat is acting up again.
oscar_martinez It's the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I'm gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I'll just go downstairs.
angela_martin Thank you.
oscar_martinez No, thank you, Angela.
oscar_martinez She doesn't know. I shouldn't be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
dwight_schrute Well, well, well, it's finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
pam_beesly These are my painting clothes.I think I'm gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today.
meredith_palmer Sure you don't want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
jim_halpert You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
pam_beesly Are you avoiding your phone call?
jim_halpert What? Yeah, right. As if.
jim_halpert Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
pam_beesly Last week Jim wasn't there, and they named the company Athlead.
jim_halpert I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
pam_beesly Tell them your opening line.
jim_halpert Hey David, how would you like a guy who's not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
pam_beesly I think it's good. He likes fishing.
jim_halpert This is gonna be awful.
pete_miller One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they're in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information's already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to "chillax," and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don't give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. Fight the power.
angela_martin Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
angela_martin Ugh!
dwight_schrute Come on in, the water's fine.
angela_martin Dwight, it's not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
dwight_schrute I know. That's not why I'm naked. I always work out without my clothes.
angela_martin Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
dwight_schrute Oh, I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I'm not in your panties, I don't go vigilantes. Why don't you ask your husband?
angela_martin My marriage is in danger. I don't know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
dwight_schrute All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
angela_martin Something like that.
dwight_schrute Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.
angela_martin Can you arrange a meeting?
dwight_schrute I can try. I'm gonna use SMS text.
angela_martin Okay.
dwight_schrute Text went through.
angela_martin Okay.
dwight_schrute All we can do is sit and wait.
angela_martin Okay.
dwight_schrute Oh, look at that. Yeah, he's free anytime. Not a problem.
jim_halpert I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
david_wallace Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there's a crisis -- the more I think about it --
jim_halpert Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I'm gone.
david_wallace They did?
jim_halpert Yep.
david_wallace Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work.
jim_halpert Oh, great.
stanley_hudson Why should we help you?
jim_halpert Because we're friends.
stanley_hudson When is my birthday?
jim_halpert Unfair. When's my birthday?
stanley_hudson I don't know, because we're not friends.
jim_halpert How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
stanley_hudson Now we're talkin'.
jim_halpert All right.
phyllis_vance Yeah.
kevin_malone Make it go taller.
pete_miller That's the idea.
kevin_malone No, not taller this way, taller this way.
pete_miller Well, I've gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.
kevin_malone You're not getting this, Peter. Make it go wider... up!
pete_miller Will do.
darryl_philbin What are y'all doing?
kevin_malone Me and Pete are building a tower.
darryl_philbin Cool. It should be taller though, right?
kevin_malone Obviously. He's a sweet kid, Darryl. But he's not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
pete_miller Kevin, I can hear you.
kevin_malone Huh?
angela_martin Ow! Dwight! Ow!
dwight_schrute Get in the van.
angela_martin God!
trevor Is it safe to talk?
dwight_schrute Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don't see them so I think we're good.
angela_martin So what are your credentials?
trevor I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, I'm damn good at it.
angela_martin Do you have a gun?
dwight_schrute Does he own a gun? Show her.
trevor You tell me.
angela_martin What is this?
trevor It's the receipt for my gun.
angela_martin You don't carry it with you?
trevor Read the receipt. That's a $300 gun. Someone could steal it.
dwight_schrute Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor's had stolen from him?
trevor Now I keep it in a safe.
dwight_schrute Mm-hmm. Good safe?
trevor Oh, you tell me.
dwight_schrute Wow!
pam_beesly I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It's just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I'm gonna limit myself to one shrub.
hidetoshi_hasagawa You paint wall now?
pam_beesly Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...
hidetoshi_hasagawa You paint now.
pam_beesly It's probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
hidetoshi_hasagawa I wait.
meredith_palmer Sweet.
erin_hannon Yay!
darryl_philbin That's what I'm talkin' about.
pete_miller This next card comes to us thanks to Meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote ‘sausage factory.'
meredith_palmer Oh OOOH!
all@
meredith_palmer Boom!
darryl_philbin Bang.
kevin_malone Yep, yep, yep.
pete_miller All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.
creed_bratton Let's find out what I did.
pete_miller All right.
dwight_schrute You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
trevor And that's all off the books?
angela_martin Obviously.
trevor Nice. No taxes.
angela_martin Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
trevor So what's the job?
angela_martin Murder.
trevor Okay, that's the big one. That's the big "M."
dwight_schrute You can't have someone murdered.
angela_martin What if they deserved it?
dwight_schrute What did they do to you, Angela?
angela_martin They're sleeping with my husband.
dwight_schrute Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you.
trevor This seems a little crazy.
dwight_schrute Yes. Crazy. Thank you.
trevor But I think I'm up for it.
dwight_schrute No! No!
angela_martin Thank you.
dwight_schrute Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I've had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--
trevor That's very effective. I've been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. It's devastating.
angela_martin No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
trevor What about a knee-capping?
dwight_schrute No! You're not helping, Trevor!
angela_martin Yes, a knee-capping could work.
dwight_schrute No. Angela! What are you saying?
angela_martin You said you would be there for me.
dwight_schrute I'm trying, but what you're asking is--
angela_martin It's the only thing that will make this right.
dwight_schrute Okay. But it's cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can't scrub worth a damn.
trevor All right, then it's settled. One knee-capping. Now, the hit goes down at 4 00. Keep in mind, once I leave, there's no turning back.
jim_halpert You know, truth be told, I think all you'll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I'm gone.
stanley_hudson We've got all afternoon to talk about that.
waiter Morning, folks.
stanley_hudson I'll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
waiter Actually, the surf and turf does come with lob--
stanley_hudson Not enough lobster. Side order.
phyllis_vance How much wine do you have?
oscar_martinez I brought you a cookie.
angela_martin Oh, thanks, Oscar. You're such an angel.
oscar_martinez I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we're good. Yeah. We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
pete_miller There we go.
all@
pete_miller Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having s*x.
nellie_bertram Oooohh... you salty dog.
darryl_philbin Well, yeah, what can I say, a player's gotta play.
pete_miller There you go.
darryl_philbin Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I'm gonna let them think the other thing.
kevin_malone Okay, I got this one.
nellie_bertram Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful
kevin_malone No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
all@ Oh no! Kevin!
nellie_bertram What did I just say? What did I just say?
pete_miller Hey, hey, hey, it's just a mistake. Just a mistake. That's what this tower's all about -- mistakes. Okay, if you're afraid of screwing up, the tower's not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That's right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let's get back to work, huh? Come on, you in?
kevin_malone Yeah.
pete_miller There we go. All right, let's do it.
jim_halpert You know, at the end of the day, it's really only two days. I mean, I'll be back in the office. If you need me for an emergency, call me. I'll be there...
phyllis_vance You know what? I don't know where the years went. ‘Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don't even recognize them.
jim_halpert Tell me about it.
phyllis_vance Whose hands are these? Theyre not my hands. I don't know.
jim_halpert All right. You know what? Maybe we'll just... We'll go slow.
phyllis_vance No. Jim...
pete_miller All right. Check it out.
all@
pete_miller Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh!
kevin_malone Nice. Pretty soon, we're gonna be at the ceiling.
erin_hannon Whoo!
pete_miller Can you hand me a card?
erin_hannon Um,. it's empty.
pete_miller What?
nellie_bertram Oh, come on. We could use a blank card.
all@ No!!
meredith_palmer That's cheating.
pam_beesly I could get us a complaint.
meredith_palmer You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn't fart on a butterfly.
pam_beesly No, I wouldn't. I can't even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I'd like to try.
nellie_bertram Hmm. Yeah. All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam...
all@ "Pam!"
angela_martin What? Why did you call me out here?
dwight_schrute The target-- it's Oscar, isn't it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
angela_martin I don't know what you're talking about.
dwight_schrute Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you're engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
angela_martin Fine! It's Oscar. So what?
dwight_schrute Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger's knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
angela_martin Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
dwight_schrute I can't even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
angela_martin Well, you might be right. But it's too late now.
dwight_schrute What do you mean?
angela_martin He's here.
dwight_schrute No! No, no!
dwight_schrute Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
oscar_martinez What?
dwight_schrute Come -- come with me.
oscar_martinez What are you doing?
dwight_schrute There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They're extraordinary.
meredith_palmer Yahtzee.
trevor Sandwich delivery for Mr. Oscar Martinez.
kevin_malone I am Oscar Martinez.
angela_martin No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside.
kevin_malone Wha-- wh--
angela_martin You know, there's doughnuts in the break room.
kevin_malone Nice! Yeah.
jim_halpert Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
stanley_hudson Don't be pushy Jim. It's tacky.
jim_halpert All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that's-- that's decorative.
phyllis_vance No, there's wine in here.
jim_halpert Still decorative.
stanley_hudson Is it white wine?
jim_halpert No.
phyllis_vance Can you help me?
jim_halpert Don't-- don't-- don't pole people with knives.
phyllis_vance ha ha!
jim_halpert Phyllis! Wow.
stanley_hudson Ooh, bring it over.
phyllis_vance Got it.
dwight_schrute There's no time to explain. Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
oscar_martinez Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
dwight_schrute What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who's the father of her child?
oscar_martinez I don't know what you're talking about.
dwight_schrute Oh, don't lie. I'm trying to save those precious knees you're always bragging about. Now, let's get out of here. He could be right behind us.
dwight_schrute Aah! Actually, he's right in front of us.
trevor Let's get it on. I'm gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but I'm gonna do this.
dwight_schrute No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He's a Dunder-Mifflin man. He's my tribe.
trevor I'm sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I'm gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No!
oscar_martinez I got it.
dwight_schrute Disarm!
trevor You don't--
dwight_schrute Don't move. And disarm now!
trevor Okay, okay, okay, okay.
dwight_schrute No! No, Oscar. He's a friend. He's a friend.
erin_hannon Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They're family-owned, but don't let that take away from your edge!
nellie_bertram Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.
creed_bratton Remember, you're a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.
pam_beesly Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I'm calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, "Hey, kool-aid." Yeah, your mama's fat. This is Pam Halpert.
pete_miller Did she buy it?
pam_beesly Basically I couldn't tell, but I think...
nellie_bertram Were they angry?
pam_beesly I-- I thought they were confused at least...
nellie_bertram Okay.
erin_hannon Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
all@
kevin_malone Nice. Nice.
creed_bratton You did good. You did good.
pete_miller See ya later, Heymont.
dwight_schrute No.
trevor If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend.
oscar_martinez What the hell, Dwight?
dwight_schrute See ya later, Trevor.
oscar_martinez you are incorrigible!
dwight_schrute I just saved your life. You're welcome!
oscar_martinez You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
angela_martin You deserved every bit of it! You made my husband gay.
oscar_martinez What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him!
angela_martin No. No.
oscar_martinez Angela, until you face that, you're gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won't stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
angela_martin Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
oscar_martinez Angela, it's a lead freaking pipe.
angela_martin God!
oscar_martinez Aah!
angela_martin You were supposed to be my friend.
oscar_martinez I'm so sorry. Angela--
dwight_schrute Oscar.
pete_miller Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert...
all@
pete_miller For insulting a client's recently deceased mother.
nellie_bertram Yes!
pam_beesly I did not know that.
pete_miller Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.
pam_beesly I'm so sorry.
meredith_palmer Wow.
pete_miller yeah. That's-- that is terrible.
all@
kevin_malone You did it.
erin_hannon Yeah!
angela_martin I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
dwight_schrute You're not stupid. Jazz is stupid.
angela_martin Jazz is stupid! I mean, just play the right notes!
dwight_schrute I know. You're gonna be okay, Monkey.
angela_martin I don't like your friend Trevor.
dwight_schrute I don't like him either. And yet I really like him.
jim_halpert Well, we're here. Perfect.
phyllis_vance We're gonna cover for you, ya know.
stanley_hudson
jim_halpert Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
stanley_hudson I did enjoy grinding your beans, son.
phyllis_vance Yeah, we really did peel your grapes.
jim_halpert This is hilarious, but we're gonna stop with all--
stanley_hudson Shuckin' your peas.
jim_halpert Shuckin' the peas. You should go back to the first part, though. You are gonna cover for me?
stanley_hudson Yeah.
phyllis_vance Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
jim_halpert Oh, my God, thank you. Thank you.
pam_beesly If you're an artist, you have to be okay with the idea that you can't please everybody all the time.
hidetoshi_hasagawa You paint very bad--
pam_beesly Shut up, Hide! I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I'm okay with that.
dwight_schrute Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
toby_flenderson That is-- that is a loaded question.
angela_martin My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
toby_flenderson He said that?
angela_martin Well, he didn't fight me hard on it.
toby_flenderson I-- I don't know if there's truth to-- to, uh, to that.
angela_martin What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
toby_flenderson Oh... uh...
angela_martin Is it called red-vining?
dwight_schrute Is it called red-vining?
toby_flenderson I don't...
dwight_schrute We heard it was called red-vining.
angela_martin People red vine.
dwight_schrute Where are gay mens' vaginas?
toby_flenderson They don't have vaginas.
dwight_schrute What?
toby_flenderson No. They're just regular men.
dwight_schrute When two gay men have s*x, how do they know whose pen1s will open up to accept the other person's pen1s?
toby_flenderson Uh... wow....

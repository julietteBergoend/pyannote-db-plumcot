dwight_schrute This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
erin_hannon
dwight_schrute It may have been the costliest decision I've ever made.
dwight_schrute My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...
jim_halpert It won't budge.
dwight_schrute I can't get it out. Try again!
dwight_schrute I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...
dwight_schrute Jim, no. No. No! No!
dwight_schrute But as Jim and I discovered... No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
dwight_schrute At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
erin_hannon Hey guys.
pam_beesly Hey.
erin_hannon Pam, what are you?
pam_beesly I am Dr. Cinderella.
jim_halpert Cece's really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
pam_beesly I'm an oncologist and you are a dog.
erin_hannon No, I'm a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
jim_halpert It's Okay.
erin_hannon Uh, Jim, you're not dressed up at all.
jim_halpert Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. Can I have your sunglasses?
erin_hannon Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
pam_beesly So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
jim_halpert There's a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
pam_beesly Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
jim_halpert Gettin' a lot of mileage out of this, aren't ya?
pam_beesly Yeah, well, get used to it, bud.
andy_bernard A jitterbug. You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?
angela_martin The senator will be joining us later.
andy_bernard Not a question.
angela_martin No, it wasn't.
andy_bernard Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere.
andy_bernard Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
andy_bernard Aaah! So good!
dwight_schrute What lab did these little clones escape from?
andy_bernard My Cornell a capella group.
pam_beesly You were in an a capella group?
darryl_philbin You went to Cornell?
andy_bernard Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
stanley_hudson Ugh. I don't want to sit through a whole concert of that.
clark I do. I love the boss's interests.
andy_bernard Atta boy Clark!
meredith_palmer Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
andy_bernard No. Nope. Nope nope nope. Stay away.
andy_bernard You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael's Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I'm so not prepared.
jim_halpert Are you sure you're okay with me putting in this much money.
pam_beesly Yeah. I mean, listen if we're gonna do this thing, we should do it right.
jim_halpert You're the best.
pam_beesly I kind of am. It's crazy.
jim_halpert Okay. I'll see you in a little bit.
pam_beesly Okay.
dwight_schrute Jim. Look I'm eating you.
jim_halpert Shut up.
dwight_schrute Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I'm eating Jims.
erin_hannon
dwight_schrute Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
erin_hannon Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
dwight_schrute Oh no, I'm spilling Jim all over the carpet.
erin_hannon Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
dwight_schrute Hello little pill. What do you do?
dwight_schrute Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation There's a madman in our midst.
pam_beesly Okay I give up. What are you?
nellie_bertram I'm sexy Toby.
pam_beesly Gross. I love it.
dwight_schrute Dumatril!
nellie_bertram Something wrong Dwight?
dwight_schrute Dumatril.
nellie_bertram Yes?
dwight_schrute This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it's not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It's not for any disorder of the body. It's for a disorder of the mind.
nellie_bertram The mind is part of the body.
dwight_schrute Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... They are now off their meds.
nellie_bertram Dwight, our co-workers' health issues are really none of our business so-
dwight_schrute Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What's going on Nellie? Talk to me.
nellie_bertram Hm?
nellie_bertram It's my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I'm not ashamed of that, But I'm not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong.
nellie_bertram Yeah, you're right. This man needs to be apprehended.
dwight_schrute I'll get my apprehension kit.
andy_bernard Ruh duh duh da dudes! What's up?
andy_bernard I know that it's pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that's when I became somebody. When I got the nickname "Boner Champ," that is when I became me.
andy_bernard You didn't come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now's your chance! I'm here. You got Qs; I got As.
HCT_Member_#1#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 Did you say you've got AIDS?
andy_bernard No, I don't have AIDS. That's not what I said. Next question.
andy_bernard You don't have any-- Any questions about the old days? You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ?
HCT_Member_#2#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 I thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ.
andy_bernard I'm sorry, what?
HCT_Member_#2#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 I just thought Broccoli Rob was the Boner Champ.
andy_bernard Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
pete_miller I didn't realize that everybody here dresses up every year.
creed_bratton Me neither.
creed_bratton It's Halloween. That is really, really good timing.
andy_bernard I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you're Boner Champ.
broccoli_rob Rob I'm so sorry! I don't know how that could have happened.
andy_bernard Did you maybe tell them that or...?
broccoli_rob Rob I just-- I just started yappin' about the old days, and I guess the wine coolers were flowing, and, you know, somehow things just got hinky.
andy_bernard Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it's really stupid, but it's also really, really, really important.
broccoli_rob Rob Will do. I love you, Andy.
andy_bernard Love you too.

jim_halpert Oh, I actually talked to my wife and we'd really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
Businessman_#2#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 Wow, well what level of investment were you thinking about?

Businessman_#3#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 Welcome aboard!
jim_halpert All right. Awesome. Cool.
dwight_schrute Hi Daryl. I'm just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
nellie_bertram You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.
dwight_schrute That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?
darryl_philbin I can't really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
dwight_schrute So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
darryl_philbin Get under your chin first. Yeah.
dwight_schrute Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
darryl_philbin Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
dwight_schrute Is that how they like to get in?
darryl_philbin Yeah, that's crazy.
dwight_schrute I don't know. I just don't know.
andy_bernard Yo! Bad boys of a capella.
all@ Hey.
andy_bernard Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories?
HCT_Member_#3#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 Yeah, I got a call from Broccoli Rob. I guess you really are the Boner Champ.
andy_bernard Did he tell you how I got the name?
HCT_Member_#3#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 No.
andy_bernard Spring sing ‘95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had s*x with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.
angela_martin And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
oscar_martinez Senator Lipton, nice to see you.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Nice to see you Oscar.
angela_martin Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem!
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton So Oscar, you're a dinosaur.
oscar_martinez Actually I'm the electoral college.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Ouch! Right on target.
angela_martin You know what? This is outrageous. I have to find Phyllis. You two talk, okay? Sorry babe.. Phyllis!
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton God, it's just so good to see you.
oscar_martinez I, uh, huh, just
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton All having this wonderful Halloween gathering. Excuse me, is that punch?
andy_bernard They didn't know about the snowman story, and when I told ‘em, they were not impressed.
erin_hannon What is with these turkeys?
andy_bernard Right?
erin_hannon Hey! You better do ‘Faith.' You get me?
HCT_Member_#3#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 We don't know it.
erin_hannon So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you're like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin' song.
HCT_Member_#3#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 Look, I know it was big with the old guys, but--
erin_hannon Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please. This isn't stupid.
pete_miller What?
toby_flenderson Hey.
dwight_schrute Hey.
nellie_bertram Hey Toby.
toby_flenderson Are... are you me?
nellie_bertram Yes.
toby_flenderson Oh my goodness, look. Look at this.
nellie_bertram Yeah. I...
toby_flenderson
nellie_bertram Yes. I thought I'd you know, be you.
toby_flenderson Look at.. Look at me.
nellie_bertram It's funny right?
dwight_schrute All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.
nellie_bertram Okay, look Dwight, let's just call this thing off. I mean, it's just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.
dwight_schrute You think I don't have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I've got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne'er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don't need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
meredith_palmer Cool. Free upper.
dwight_schrute Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
meredith_palmer Don't dog catch me!
dwight_schrute Gotcha! Yeah! Let's see ya get out of this web, huh?
meredith_palmer Let me out!
nellie_bertram The pill is mine.
dwight_schrute What?
nellie_bertram Get her out.
dwight_schrute Oh.
meredith_palmer Stop baggin' my head!
nellie_bertram Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It's for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too.
pam_beesly Hey, how'd it go?
jim_halpert Oh man, it was great. They were great.
pam_beesly Did you end up investing?
jim_halpert I did, yeah.
pam_beesly How much?
jim_halpert Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
pam_beesly About ten?
jim_halpert Ten. It was the full ten.
pam_beesly Wow.
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly Wow.
jim_halpert Yeah. Yeah. It's a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
pam_beesly No yeah. Yeah.
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly So did everybody ...
jim_halpert What is it?
pam_beesly Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?
jim_halpert Um, oh man, I don't actually know.
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert They weren't really talking that much about money. They just said, We're good with investing and then I...and I...
andy_bernard Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
pam_beesly They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
jim_halpert No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
pam_beesly So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
jim_halpert You weren't there.
jim_halpert It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
pam_beesly Talk about it now.
jim_halpert Pam.
pam_beesly Jim, that was most of our savings.
clark Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where's the band? ‘Cause there's just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths.
creed_bratton Yeah. That's what she said.
clark What, am I overdoing it? No. No.
pam_beesly We said some. We said ‘some.'
jim_halpert We'll talk about it later.
pam_beesly We said part not all.
clark Yes! All right!
andy_bernard Oh Man!
clark That's how you do that! Whoo!
all@ Thank you.
stanley_hudson Show some pride. This is crap.
dwight_schrute I agree. Yes, crap. Continue.
HCT_Member_#3#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 Now folks, by special request, we're going to take it a little old school. There is a former Trebler in this room.
darryl_philbin Who?
HCT_Member_#3#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 It's Mr. Andy Bernard!
all@
andy_bernard No. Do not sing that. Do not... Oh man...
HCT_Member_#3#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 He reminded us today of how much he means to us. And we certainly seem to mean a lot to him, so without any further ado, here's an old Treble classic.
broccoli_rob Rob
andy_bernard Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli Rob doing here?
HCT_Member_#3#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 She said you wanted to hear ‘Faith'. That's Broccoli Rob's signature song.
andy_bernard That's my signature song.
HCT_Member_#3#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 I really didn't know that man. I just thought you wanted to hear it.
andy_bernard Russell, I'm dressed like George Michael.
HCT_Member_#3#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode05 I thought you were Adam Lambert.
andy_bernard Wha...?
erin_hannon The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it's kind of pathetic. But when you're with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
erin_hannon Are you okay?
broccoli_rob Rob He's still mad.
andy_bernard Shut up, Broccoli.
broccoli_rob Rob Champ, I feel awful about this whole thing. Russell called me up. And they said they needed 20 cc's of George Michael stat. So just... Wham! I sprang into action. You know me. I assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number.
andy_bernard You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man's signature solo is his for life, okay? That's group policy and you know it.
broccoli_rob Rob Look, it's not my fault that I still live near campus, and it's my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys., and stop in two, three times a week.
andy_bernard Just don't do the song anymore.
broccoli_rob Rob I tell you what, we'll have a sing-off for it. You pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and I'll do the same, and I'm so confident that I'll win, I won't even warm up.
andy_bernard Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes.
broccoli_rob Rob My pipes are primo, Champ. Why don't you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes?
andy_bernard I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!
broccoli_rob Rob He said, and I quote, ‘Hey Rob, nice pipes'. That happened!
andy_bernard OK, fine, yeah. that's one guy's opinion!
broccoli_rob Rob That's real. 'That'll never change!
erin_hannon Okay!
andy_bernard Doesn't mean you're the best singer ever. Dick.
jim_halpert I thought that concert was pretty great.
kevin_malone Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
angela_martin They lost me when they sang ‘Monster Mash'. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
jim_halpert Angela, it's Halloween. You have to sing ‘Monster Mash'.
pam_beesly Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
jim_halpert Uh...
pam_beesly No I'm just, I'm saying, what would happen if they didn't sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?
jim_halpert Okay. We'll, just forget it.
pam_beesly No! No, I'm interested. I mean I think everybody's interested in why they have to sing it.
jim_halpert Because it is Halloween. So if you're going to sing a concert, it's a good idea to throw that one in.
pam_beesly Yeah, yeah, no, no. It's a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can't do if you just keep singing ‘Monster Mash.'
kevin_malone It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ‘Monster Mash.' I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though Jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, Pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
andy_bernard This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?
erin_hannon Yeah.
andy_bernard I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?
erin_hannon Oh well, Andy, we're not moving to Cornell.
andy_bernard Duh. I know. That would be insane.
erin_hannon Yeah.
andy_bernard It could totally work though. I don't know why we wouldn't. Oh my god are we doing this?
erin_hannon Oy. Andy, what's going on?
andy_bernard If I am not Boner Champ, I don't know who I am.
erin_hannon Well, um, you know maybe you're the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
andy_bernard Make a donation.
erin_hannon Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
andy_bernard Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.
erin_hannon Oh.
dwight_schrute I want some of those pills.
nellie_bertram Oh, well good for you. I mean, you'll need a prescription.
dwight_schrute Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They're not for me. They're for my cousin Mose. He's just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
nellie_bertram Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he's a good man and that I hope he feels better.
dwight_schrute Which one? Mose or the real Mose?
nellie_bertram The real Mose.
dwight_schrute He says Thank you.
andy_bernard Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. What?
erin_hannon What's wrong?
andy_bernard My parents are broke.

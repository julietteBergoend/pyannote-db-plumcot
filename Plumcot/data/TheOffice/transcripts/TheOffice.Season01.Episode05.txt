michael_scott Hey, you ready?
michael_scott All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. Very good. Excellent, excellent.
dwight_schrute Michael!
michael_scott Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, "This might be kinda fun." And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
michael_scott Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.
dwight_schrute Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
michael_scott No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
dwight_schrute Oh, please.
michael_scott When I let him come to my pick-up game...
dwight_schrute I apologized for that.
michael_scott I vouched for you.
dwight_schrute Michael, I...
michael_scott I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
dwight_schrute I can handle that.
michael_scott Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.
dwight_schrute And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
michael_scott Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager.
dwight_schrute Same thing.
michael_scott No, it's not. It's lower, so...
dwight_schrute It's close.
dwight_schrute So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.
jim_halpert God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
phyllis_vance Keep me out of it.
pam_beesly My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.
michael_scott All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right.
ryan_howard Fine, don't worry about that.
michael_scott And here we have "Mister Roger's Neighborhood." Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs.
lonny What's up?
michael_scott And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
darryl_philbin It's not my real name.
michael_scott No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
ryan_howard Darryl Rogers?
darryl_philbin Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
michael_scott And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
ryan_howard Yeah, yeah.
michael_scott You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job! Rapport!
pam_beesly No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.
jim_halpert Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.
michael_scott So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on.
darryl_philbin We're loading at one.
michael_scott Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me.
darryl_philbin No, we got a truck going out at 1 15. So, that's the busy time.
michael_scott Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way.
darryl_philbin All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
michael_scott All right, see you at one.
michael_scott Are we ready for the game?
all@ Yeah.
michael_scott I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
dwight_schrute Gimli.
michael_scott Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.
dwight_schrute Just trying to be helpful.
michael_scott Uh, "I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword."
jim_halpert That's him.
michael_scott OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.
stanley_hudson I'm sorry?
michael_scott Um, what do you play? Center?
stanley_hudson Why "of course"?
michael_scott Uh...
stanley_hudson What's that supposed to mean?
michael_scott Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.
jim_halpert Uh, I heard it.
michael_scott Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.
phyllis_vance I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
michael_scott Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
ryan_howard But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?
michael_scott Yes.
ryan_howard OK.
michael_scott Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
oscar_martinez I can help out, if you need me.
michael_scott I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
kevin_malone I have a hoop in my driveway.
michael_scott No.
phyllis_vance I have a sports bra.
michael_scott No, no, ridiculous.
dwight_schrute Michael, look. Missed it...
michael_scott Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.
dwight_schrute Yes!
michael_scott Sorry Phyllis.
dwight_schrute Can I be team captain?
michael_scott No, I'm team captain.
dwight_schrute Can I be team manager?
michael_scott No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.
dwight_schrute Assistant team manager?
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.
michael_scott Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now.
jim_halpert Oh my God.
michael_scott Threat neutralized.
michael_scott Off the backboard!
pam_beesly Please don't throw garbage at me.
michael_scott Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
pam_beesly I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.
jim_halpert I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
michael_scott Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
pam_beesly Maybe Angela would cheerlead.
michael_scott Oh, yeah right.
phyllis_vance I'll do it.
michael_scott Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good.
michael_scott Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
darryl_philbin Just getting a tea bag.
michael_scott Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
darryl_philbin Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
michael_scott Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.
darryl_philbin No, that's not as much fun. You know what?
michael_scott What?
darryl_philbin You're on.
michael_scott OK. Cool, you're on. Don't screw this up.
michael_scott Classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game.
angela_martin Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you.
jim_halpert Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here.
jim_halpert You coming down?
pam_beesly Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones.
jim_halpert You gonna wish me luck?
pam_beesly Yeah, you're gonna need it.
jim_halpert Whoa.
jim_halpert Is that trash talk from Pam?
pam_beesly I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive.
jim_halpert Oh.
pam_beesly And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
jim_halpert Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along.
pam_beesly Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake.
jim_halpert I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
michael_scott Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go! OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you're fired. That's a joke. OK, let's do it.
jim_halpert Have a good game man.
roy_anderson Yeah, you too. Should be fun.
michael_scott All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
ryan_howard I stretched before I came.
michael_scott OK.
michael_scott OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy.
jim_halpert Really? I thought I'd take Roy.
michael_scott Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys.
dwight_schrute OK, we'll be skins!
michael_scott Aw, come on Dwight.
dwight_schrute What? Shirts on or off?
michael_scott On. Just put it on.
dwight_schrute You sure?
michael_scott Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK?
roy_anderson Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car.
michael_scott Stanley! What? You gotta be kidding me! !?! Oh... Here we go! Who's on him? Somebody get him!
all@ Yeah!
roy_anderson That's what I'm talking about.
michael_scott Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. Here we go. Three! Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone!
dwight_schrute De-fense! De-fense!
michael_scott and Dwight De-fense! De-fense!
darryl_philbin Well done team.
michael_scott Who's got Roy?
pam_beesly Woo!
michael_scott Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually hit those. Dwight, I was open. All right, let's go.
michael_scott OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That's a foul.
roy_anderson OK.
michael_scott OK, I'll take it. OK.
michael_scott When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It's gone, I'm in the zone.
michael_scott What is wrong with me today?!
michael_scott Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine. What's Dunder Mifflin? I've never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, that's probably gonna happen, actually.
michael_scott Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut! Whoa!
jim_halpert My bad.
darryl_philbin Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
lonny Where you at? Where you at? You over there? I'm over there.
michael_scott That is cool. Is that like the Robot?
michael_scott Nice! Come here!
ryan_howard Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine.
darryl_philbin You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
roy_anderson All right, let's go.
darryl_philbin Watch your back Madge.
madge Hey! Come on man!
michael_scott Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!
dwight_schrute Yeah! In your face!
madge Yeah, like that counts.
michael_scott You know what? Dwight, Dwight...
michael_scott Football is like rock and roll, it's just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? You're kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It's all downbeat, it's in the pocket, it's like... Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah...
michael_scott Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter...
roy_anderson Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.
michael_scott All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!
michael_scott What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls.
jim_halpert You know what? Let me take Roy.
michael_scott All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.
michael_scott Shoot, shoot it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression! Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up.
darryl_philbin Block, block, block!
madge He's afraid of you now.
michael_scott Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?
michael_scott Yes!
roy_anderson What the hell man?
jim_halpert Take it easy.
roy_anderson No, you take it easy.
michael_scott Watch the long passes, you guys!
ryan_howard Same team, Dwight.
michael_scott Dwight!
dwight_schrute Yes!
michael_scott Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what's the score?
angela_martin You're ahead.
michael_scott Yeah, baby, here we go!
michael_scott Jim! Jim! Right here! Ow! God! Hold it!
michael_scott I'm sorry.
michael_scott Foul! Foul!
michael_scott I'm sorry. You all right?
michael_scott Oh, that hurts.
michael_scott Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
michael_scott What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
darryl_philbin Take your shot man!
michael_scott No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.
michael_scott No it wasn't.
michael_scott Yes, it was. You know what, I'm just being fair.
michael_scott Oh, really? No, I just put my arm up...
michael_scott Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly.
angela_martin This is a cold pack...
dwight_schrute Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag.
michael_scott Thanks Dwight.
lonny Wait, what does that mean? What is it, a tie? What's going on?
michael_scott Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won.
darryl_philbin That was you.
michael_scott It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
roy_anderson No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday.
darryl_philbin Yeah, this isn't happening.
michael_scott Um... well, you guys, you know, I'm the boss so...
lonny So what's that? We're coming in on Monday, right?
michael_scott Hey, hey...
lonny Monday?
michael_scott You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.
jim_halpert ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good.
pam_beesly Mmm-hmm.
jim_halpert I didn't sign anything.
roy_anderson Hey baby.
pam_beesly Hey.
roy_anderson Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend.
pam_beesly Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh? Let's get you into a tub.
roy_anderson Yeah? Let's get you into a tub.
michael_scott Hey, what a game, huh? What a game.
oscar_martinez What time do we have to come in?
michael_scott Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.
michael_scott The great thing about sports is that it is all about character. And you can learn lessons about life even if you don't win. But we did because we were ahead.

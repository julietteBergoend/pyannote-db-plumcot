Pam Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
Angela So cute.
Oscar Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
Pam Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
Angela News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
Pam Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course.
Angela That is where we disagree.
Oscar Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
Pam No, three-month-old humans don't do that.
Angela My Phillip is crawling.
Pam Angela is such a liar!
Oscar It's maddening!
Oscar Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
Pam Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again.
Angela No one said "you must have two"
Oscar Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
Angela No thank you.
Andy  Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat...am i right?
Angela/Pam Unbelievable!
Oscar Un-be-liev-a-ble.
Nellie It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it?
Packer That's great.
Dwight Pretty good.
Nellie Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.
Dwight  That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
Nellie I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.
Dwight Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
Jim Catching butterflies.
Dwight That's a hobby, unless it's for food.
Jim Theater.
Dwight Waste of time.
Jim Dragging.
Dwight That's just a verb.
Jim Dragging sticks.
Dwight Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.
Nellie Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just... you three, no.
Packer Not good enough 
Dwight English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. You're crap. You're wonderful. They're mean, but they're incisive.
Nellie Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7 00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
Packer I'll be there at 6 00
Cathy Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about.
Jim 'Talla-nasty', very clever.
Cathy Thank you-
Gabe Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' no, no, no, no...
Jim Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
Stanley My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? . Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
Andy Okay, everybody. 5 00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!
Pam Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
Andy Say what?
Pam We are good to goooo!
Andy Say what?
Pam We're good to goooo!
Angela Stop it.
Andy Say-
Angela Stop it.
Oscar Andy.
Andy Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
Pam Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
Andy ...ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
Packer Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass.
Nellie Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
Dwight Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ... What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. 
Packer Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips.
Dwight That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
Gabe What happens if you're the hunchback?
Dwight Oh, you get kicked.
Jim How many buttons do you have?
Dwight  40. Always.
Cathy Can I see?
Dwight Sure. 
Cathy So, I get to kick you now.
Dwight No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
Cathy Well, that's how I played it in college.
Jim College rules 
Dwight Aah!
Packer Aaaaand he host at his own lame game.
Nellie Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit.
Packer Thank you.
Ryan I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
Erin And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
Waitress Sorry, no waffles.
Erin Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
Ryan A waffle?
Erin A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
Ryan No.
Erin I'm moving down here, you know.
Ryan Oh, no, I didn't know.
Erin I'm young, and I can ... and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
Ryan You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
Ryan Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? Hey.
Erin Hey.
Pam Watson carpet and tile.
Kevin One order.
Oscar Order reference number 00983-126.
Phyllis Eight Cases, bright white inkjet.
Angela Paid.
Kelly I'm dying!
Darryl Processed.
Val And delivered.
Kelly Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
Nellie I will be right back.
Packer I will be here.
Dwight Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
Packer Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle. 
Dwight Well, saddles... ... sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
Packer What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me.
Dwight If anyone's having s*x with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
Andy Who is ready for dinner? "oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid". No. I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves...  A Jamaican feast, mon!
Phyllis If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Andy Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!
Val Hey.
Brandon How you doing, Val? 
Oscar Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Brandon Oh no, I'm not actually Jamaican.
Oscar Terrific.
Darryl What's up man? I'm Darryl.
Brandon Darryl, I heard about you. You doing good?
Darryl Oh yeah.
Brandon Must be doing real good since you're f***ing my girlfriend.
Everyone Whoa.
Kevin Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
Darryl I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.
Val Brandon, what the hell are you talking about?
Brandon Don't play dumb with me. I know what's up.
Val Honey, I am not sleeping with-
Andy Heyyy... let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!
Brandon Hope you all like goat.
Andy Goat...
Nellie Blow in my ear.
Packer Alright.
Nellie Like I'm on the beach.
Dwight  Seagull. 
Nellie And a wave crashing... a wave crashing.
Nellie Oh, that is lovely.
Jim Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
Jim Hey, how's it going?
Cathy Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here?
Jim Uh... yeah, I'm just watching basketball.
Cathy Okay, yeah.
Jim Okay.
Cathy Cool... Is this March Madness? I love March Madness.
Jim Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in... March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so... 
Cathy LeBron James.
Jim Yes, nice. Good word association
Cathy 
Nellie Impressive.
Dwight Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it 
Andy Thornwood Wholesalers.
Kevin One order.
Brandon I read the text you sent to Val, man.
Val That's messed up.
Angela Is this spicy?
Brandon No, baby girl. It would be messed up if I didn't find anything, but I did, so-
Andy I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
Brandon At midnight?
Andy ... yeah...
Kevin It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery...
Kelly Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
Andy Thank you.
Kelly I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
Andy Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?
Kelly No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
Jim Yup, coming. All right.
Stanley My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
Jim We have plenty.
Stanley Oh, hello. 
Jim Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
Stanley Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
Jim No, no, no, Stanley.
Stanley mm-hmm. 
Jim Stanley. Stanley.
Stanley uh-huh.
Jim Stanley. Uhh... you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
Erin Whoa. the lights are still on.
Ryan Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
Erin I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Ryan Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
Erin  Hello, waffle iron.
Ryan Hello, what do we have here?
Erin Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl...
Ryan Right.
Erin ... a measuring cup...
Ryan Got that. Get down.
Erin  It's the fuzz!
Ryan  Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
Darryl "I got too much ice cream. You want some?" "Getting' my fry on."
Kelly Boring.
Darryl Uh, "The moon is huge tonight."
Phyllis Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
Darryl That's regular text talk.
Brandon You forgot one.
Darryl "You're such a great friend."
Brandon With the dots.
Darryl "You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot."
Kelly Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means "Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
Everyone Oh...
Brandon See? Yes. Thank you, sister.
Val Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right?
Darryl Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
Nellie You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
Dwight You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? ...ahhmmm... excuse me... What?! Not now, I'm busy.
Jim  I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
Dwight Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no... Freak, I need a favor.
Gabe Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.
Dwight I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
Gabe What's in it for GSL?
Dwight You really want Packer as your boss?
Gabe Got it.
Dwight If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
Dwight Where did you see it?
Jim In the bed.
Cathy I haven't seen anything.
Dwight We gotta find it before it eggs. 
Cathy Jeez...
Dwight Describe it.
Jim Brown, shiny, painful bite.
Dwight Could be a bat weevil... Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
Jim Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
Dwight Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
Jim So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
Dwight Pshh. That's a bedbug.
Jim Yeah.
Dwight Everything's a joke.
Jim I know.
Dwight Check your hair! 
Jim Ow.
Dwight God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
Jim Just check it.
Dwight You are clean. Okay... One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide I am going to generate myself into a human trap. When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. 
Jim Alright.
Dwight Yeah. Cover me!
Cathy Is this really nessecary?
Jim He knows what he's doing.
Dwight Let the bedbugs bite!
Cathy Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower.
Jim Alright, then I will catch you later... What do we do now?
Dwight We wait. Come to papa.
Jim Oh.
Jim I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
Dwight Nope, I wasn't bitten.
Jim Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
Dwight Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
Jim Come on.
Dwight If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
Jim You know what? Maybe they just ate.
Dwight No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
Jim Okay, they're fine. They're adults.
Dwight No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
Jim Is that really how you want to get this job?
Dwight Such a chorus girl.
Jim Okay, Dwight... Dwight... Dwight, Dwight Dwight!... uh...
Cathy  Is crazy gone?
Nellie Oh!
Gabe They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!
Dwight Euughh... Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present... Hey.
Cathy Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster... Okay, cool. Thanks... I know, I'm a pig, right?
Jim Hmm? No.
Cathy  Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously.
Jim Okay alright. I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
Cathy Oh my God, what are you thinking?
Jim um... I mean-
Cathy I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me?
Jim I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
Cathy Can you... without running to the other side of the room all night?
Jim Yes, I can. uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just... we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
Cathy Okay. I am so cold.
Jim 
Pam Hey, Darryl. You okay?
Darryl She's got a boyfriend.
Andy Play it cool, man. She'll come around.
Pam No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there.
Andy Yeah, but... My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.
Pam My husband would tell you to go for it.
Ryan Hey.
Erin Hey.
Ryan Hey.
Erin Hey.
Ryan Hey, this is fun.
Erin A lot of fun.
Ryan I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
Erin You should move down here with me.
Ryan Yeah?
Erin We could be roommates.
Ryan Really?
Erin We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
Ryan Yeah.
Erin Maybe in six months-
Ryan  Six months?... um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
Nellie Put your forehead near mine, and see if you can read my thoughts.
Dwight Okay... Seven, one, one, nine...
Nellie No, no, no, not numbers, no.
Dwight No, okay.
Nellie No.
Dwight Try again... Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one... is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
Nellie Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
Dwight Wait, the numbers!
Nellie Mm-hmm.
Dwight oh...
Nellie mm-hmm...
Dwight There you go.
Nellie I will see you in seven-
Dwight Seven minutes. ... Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. . 
Dwight  Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
Angela 1434-967, paid.
Darryl It has been processed.
Val It has been delivered.
Pam That's it, last one.
Kelly Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
Andy Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee...
Phyllis No way.
Andy I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion...
Val Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
Darryl Sure.
Val Okay, thanks.
Darryl Hey, just so you know, me and you... I don't think that's ridiculous... Dot, dot, dot... dot, dot.
Jim All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
Cathy What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right?
Jim Cathy, go.
Dwight  Where's the bug?
Jim Awesome.
Dwight  Stand back!
Cathy Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!
Dwight  It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
Cathy 
Jim Right there! 
Cathy Oh stop it, stop it, stop it!
Jim  Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
Cathy I can't breathe!
Dwight I think I saw it!
Cathy Stop it! 
Jim Nice job, I think you got 'em.
Dwight You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
Jim 
Dwight Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.
Jim Oh yeah? What's the first best?
Nellie  Dwight? Hello? Dwight?
Jim  Is that Nellie?
Dwight  Don't let-shh!
Nellie Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello?  Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello? Dwight? Dwight.

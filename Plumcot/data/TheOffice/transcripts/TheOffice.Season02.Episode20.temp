Dwight Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.
Jim You look cute today, Dwight.
Dwight Thanks, girl.
Jim So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight finding drugs is more dangerous than most people using drugs.
Dwight Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds like slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
Kevin  Hey...
Dwight I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.
Jim  I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
Pam  Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, that's supposed to be Phyllis. I can't do it as good as he can.
Kelly And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said "Is it okay if I sip it?" and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
Dwight Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour. Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is is on the line! Now I'm going to ask you again. What time did you go home last night?
Kelly Six.
Dwight I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
Ryan I go to a lot of parties.
Dwight Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me you keys.
Ryan I am not giving you my keys.
Dwight Don't make me do this the hard way.
Ryan What's the hard way?
Dwight I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
Ryan Yeah, let's do it that way.
Michael Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.
Dwight I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
Jim Whoa. You are a volunteer.
Dwight I volunteered for this job.
Jim And that's not the same.
Dwight It is my duty...
Jim  Volunteer duty.
Dwight ...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
Michael  Narc!
Kevin 
Dwight If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
Michael I wasn't attempting to compliment you.
Dwight Well, you have...
Michael Uuf, well...
Dwight ...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
Michael  Okay...
Dwight ...and I am very proud of being a narc.
Michael Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! Dude, where's my office? I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!
Jim Well, your office is behind you.
Michael Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
Ryan I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Dwight Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
Dwight Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
Oscar No, I have not.
Dwight Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
Oscar What are you implying?
Dwight Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
Oscar Okay. I'm done with this.
Dwight He sure left in a hurry.
Dwight I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
Dwight Do you know what this is? 
Phyllis Yes, it's marijuana.
Dwight How do you know that?
Phyllis It's labeled.
Dwight  Dammit.
Creed That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.
Dwight No, it's marijuana.
Jim I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
Dwight That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.
Jim Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
Dwight I would remember.
Jim Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
Dwight That's not how it works.
Jim Now how do you know how it works?
Dwight Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.
Jim No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
Dwight 
Oscar So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
Jim Oh, um... Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me? 
Stanley Is that supposed to be me?
Jim Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
Stanley I do not think that is funny.
Pam He does everyone in the office.
Stanley Hmmmpt.
Pam/Jim  I do not think that is funny.
Pam Jinx! Buy me a coke.
Jim Oh...
Pam No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke. Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid. 
Pam Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
Jim  C'mon!
Pam Sorry, that's not my problem.
Jim 
Dwight I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.
Angela I understand.
Dwight Where were you yesterday after work?
Angela 
Michael Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin?
Kevin That is so good, Michael
Michael Remember the narc bit? Uh-oh, who's in trouble?
Dwight Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
Michael Waa... what? What are you talking about?
Dwight Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
Oscar Is that true, Toby?
Toby Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.
Michael Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.
Michael Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
Dwight No you can't do that.
Michael I can do that, it is my office.
Dwight No you cannot. It has to be official, and it has to be urine.
Michael Hmmm. Ha. Alright. Great.
Dwight Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
Kevin I'm not taking Rogaine.
Dwight Angela, what about you?
Angela I don't take any prescription drugs.
Dwight You're not on anything?
Angela 
Dwight Good.
Kelly So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. I mean not everything, Jim. I promise, I'm not that kind of...
Pam Hey guys, what's going on?
Kelly We're having the best conversation. 
Pam Oh, okay. Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. 
Kelly So, I was looking so hot...
Michael It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
Phyllis We don't feel that way.
Angela No, not at all.
Oscar You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
Michael No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, "Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs."
Dwight Thank you, Michael.
Michael I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
Michael Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
Stanley Where did you get these facts?
Michael Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
Stanley They are not.
Michael Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
Stanley No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week. For the antioxidants.
Michael Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
Toby Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.
Michael Yes it is.
Toby No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
Michael Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
Toby You can't do that.
Michael I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
Toby That's not random.
Michael Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam.
Pam I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Michael Really? 
Pam Uh, hmmm.
Michael Jim it's okay. You can t... This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. Oh, he's doing it, okay. It's okay. Oh. Okay, are you sure? That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. Okay, well.
Pam Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
Michael The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.
Dwight No, you will be tested.
Michael Yes, I will not be.
Dwight You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
Michael Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
Dwight Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
Linda We test a lot of urine.
Dwight Mine was green.
Linda Oh, right. How are you?
Dwight I'm all better.
Michael So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
Dwight What kind of filing?
Michael Just forget it. Just the urine.
Dwight That goes directly to the tester.
Michael Just. I need your urine.
Dwight Like in a cup?
Michael Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
Dwight For what purpose?
Michael It's none of your business.
Dwight Then I refuse.
Michael Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
Dwight Are you serious?
Michael I need clean urine for the lady.
Dwight But that's illegal.
Michael Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes
Dwight Not my urine.
Michael A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
Dwight Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
Michael No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.
Angela Do you want to give Michael your urine?
Dwight I want him to have all the urine he needs.
Angela You're not going to get my permission on this.
Dwight I know that. Don't you think I know that?
Linda Yeah, we do testing all over the country.
Ryan Cool. Hey, are you guys hiring?
Linda You want to work at the urinalysis lab?
Ryan Yeah. Maybe.
Dwight My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.
Pam What? Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. 
Kevin I'd like a magazine.
Linda We just need urine, sir.
Kevin I'd still like one.
Michael Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.
Dwight That's great.
Michael What's wrong? Where's your costume?
Dwight It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
Michael Why? Wha...
Dwight I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
Pam  Here. Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. 
Jim Hi.
Pam Hey.
Jim How much time do you have left on your break?
Pam Ten minutes.
Michael Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
Dwight Really?
Michael Yes, sir.
Dwight That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
Michael So you wanna? Thanks.
Hank Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security.
Michael Okay.
Hank Here's your badge.
Dwight Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. Can I have a gun?
Hank No, I don't have a gun.
Dwight Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
Hank I don't think so.
Michael Good.
Dwight  Thank you, Michael.
Michael No. Oh. Uh...
Dwight I need to go over some details with you.
Michael Alright. Well, Thank you.
Dwight First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
Hank Two.
Dwight Oh, God.
Jim Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
